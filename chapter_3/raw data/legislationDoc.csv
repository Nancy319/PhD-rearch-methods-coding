This report must be peer reviewed by a suitably qualified person jointly appointed by the authorised person and Greater Wellington Regional Council, and the comments on that review must be provided to a panel; and an assessment of the effects of construction activities, including earthworks, on neighbouring properties; and an assessment of the effects of construction activities on the transport network, including on local roads; and an earthworks and sediment control assessment; and an infrastructure assessment and stormwater management plan; and a geotechnical assessment. An expert consenting panel must invite comments on any consent application relating to the project from the following persons in addition to the persons listed in clause 17(6) of Schedule 6 of the Act: Capital and Coast District Health Board; and Ferndale Residents’ Association; and Park Road Residents’ Association. No further provision is necessary to give effect to decisions made by the Minister under section 24 of the Act in respect of the project. The Minister for the Environment has accepted this application for referral. The Minister considered the application against the criteria in the COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track Consenting) Act 2020 (the Act) and the Act’s purpose, and sought and considered written comments from the relevant Ministers (including the Minister for Seniors), the local authorities, and the New Zealand Transport Agency. The Minister accepted the application for the following reasons: the project will help to achieve the purpose of the Act; and the project will provide up to 30 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs in the first stage (earthworks) and up to 270 FTE jobs in the second stage (construction); and the project will result in a public benefit by providing additional housing supply for aged persons and aged-care facilities; and the project will provide investment into the Kāpiti Coast’s aged-care sector; and any adverse effects arising from the application and mitigation measures can be tested by an expert consenting panel against Part 2 of the Resource Management Act 1991 and the purpose of the Act. This order, which comes into force on 16 April 2021, amends the COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track Consenting) Referred Projects Order 2020. The effect of the amendment is to refer 2 projects to an expert consenting panel for the purpose of the COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track Consenting) Act 2020 (the Act). The referred projects are the projects named and described in new Schedules 16 and 17. The effect of the referral is— to authorise Hughes Developments Limited to apply under the Act, instead of under the Resource Management Act 1991, for resource consents relating to the project described in new Schedule 16; and to authorise Summerset Villages (Waikanae) Limited to apply under the Act, instead of under the Resource Management Act 1991, for resource consents relating to the project described in new Schedule 17. The expert consenting panels will be appointed under Schedule 5 of the Act and make decisions in accordance with Schedule 6 of the Act.",https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2021/0070/latest/whole.html

2021-04-07T19:28:45,COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border and Isolation and Quarantine) Amendment Order 2021," This order is made by the Minister for COVID-19 Response— under sections 11 and 15(1) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020; and in accordance with section 9 of that Act. This order is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border and Isolation and Quarantine) Amendment Order 2021. This order comes into force at 11.59 pm on 9 April 2021. This Part amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) 2020. In clause 4(1), replace the definition of confirmed allocation with: confirmed allocation has the meaning given by clause 15H of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine) Order 2020 In clause 4(1), replace the definition of managed isolation allocation system with: managed isolation allocation system has the meaning given by clause 15H of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine) Order 2020 This Part amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine) Order 2020.

The chief executive must ensure that the managed isolation allocation system does not at any time permit the issue of more confirmed allocations than the number of available allocations. A person may obtain a confirmed allocation by— registering on the managed isolation allocation system online portal and obtaining a voucher (an online allocation); or applying to the chief executive in the form approved by the chief executive and submitting supporting evidence (an offline allocation). The Minister must determine the apportionment between the issue of online allocations and offline allocations. Online allocations to low-risk MIQFs may be issued on a basis that the Minister decides. In making a decision under subclause (1), the Minister must take into account— the right of New Zealanders to enter New Zealand; and the need to mitigate, so far as possible, the social, economic, and other impacts of COVID-19. The basis on which online allocations to low-risk MIQFs are issued may— distinguish between different classes of persons entering New Zealand (for example, between New Zealanders and non-New Zealanders); and prioritise allocations as between different classes of persons; and reserve for a particular class, or any classes, of persons a specific proportion of allocations. Offline allocations to low-risk MIQFs may be issued to persons meeting the criteria decided by the Minister and published from time to time  by the chief executive on MBIE’s Internet site. A person may apply to the chief executive for an offline allocation and the chief executive must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, determine that application. If the chief executive is satisfied that an application meets the criteria, the chief executive may issue to the applicant an offline allocation to a low-risk MIQF. The chief executive of MBIE may at any time— amend an online or offline allocation issued to any person (for example, if the starting date for isolation specified in an offline allocation issued to an individual is required to be changed because of a travel delay): cancel an online or offline allocation issued to any person (for example, if the person no longer requires the allocation, or can no longer use the allocation because of a cancelled flight). Revoke clause 19.

Part 1 of this order amends the Air Border Order so that confirmed allocation and managed isolation allocation system have the meanings given in the Isolation and Quarantine Order. Part 2 of this order amends the Isolation and Quarantine Order to provide that the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment (the chief executive) is responsible for the operation of the managed isolation allocation system. Allocations to low-risk managed isolation or quarantine facilities may be issued online and offline. Online allocations are issued on the basis determined by the Minister for COVID-19 Response and that basis may prioritise between different classes of persons and reserve a specific proportion of allocations for a particular class of persons. Offline allocations may be issued by the chief executive to persons satisfying the application criteria decided by the Minister and published on MBIE’s Internet site. The chief executive may at any time amend or cancel an allocation. This order must be approved by a resolution of the House of Representatives before the end of the relevant period described in section 16(2) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020.

2021-04-01T12:44:33,Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Bill," In May 2020, Parliament passed the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Act 2020, which amended the Immigration Act 2009 (the principal Act) by giving the Government 8 time-limited powers to enable the immigration system to respond flexibly to challenges raised by the COVID-19 outbreak. In the order they appear in the principal Act, they are the power to— vary or cancel conditions for classes of resident visa class holders: impose, vary, or cancel conditions for classes of temporary entry visa class holders: waive any regulatory requirements for certain classes of application (that is, waive any prescribed requirements to make an application): grant visas to individuals and classes of people in the absence of an application: extend the expiry dates of visas for classes of people: waive the requirement to obtain a transit visa in an individual case or suspend a transit visa waiver made by regulations in an individual case: certify immigration instructions under which an immigration officer may revoke the entry permission of a person who has been deemed by regulations made under the principal Act to have been granted entry permission: make regulations suspending the ability to make applications for visas or to submit expressions of interest in applying for visas by classes of people. These powers enable the Government to amend visa conditions for large groups of people, extend visas of large groups of people for varying periods of time (enabling staggered processing of further visa applications from those needing to remain in New Zealand), stop people overseas from making applications while it is not possible to travel to New Zealand due to border restrictions, and enable the revocation of entry permission for people with deemed entry permission while border restrictions are in place. These powers are subject to a range of safeguards, one of which is amended by this Bill. That safeguard is that all powers are automatically repealed 1 year after their commencement. However, while New Zealand’s domestic situation has improved since the introduction of the powers, the global circumstances under which the powers were initially passed still stand—a continued border closure and global pandemic with wide-ranging impacts on temporary visa holders both onshore and offshore. The arguments for continuing to maintain flexibility in control over applications for temporary entry class visas and to maintain an ability to amend visa settings for whole classes of visa holders will remain until border restrictions are lifted. Part 1 of the Bill (temporary powers relating to visas) extends the repeal date of the powers by a further 2 years, to the close of 15 May 2023. It also amends, to 6 months, the maximum duration of a suspension of the ability of certain offshore persons to make temporary entry class visa applications. Those suspensions are made by regulation, and, at present, can last for a maximum of 3 months at a time. The change is necessary because the suspension period has had to be renewed for a longer period of time than was initially envisaged, and the frequency of renewal is burdensome. In addition, the current suspension period may be giving intending visa applicants the impression that the border will open soon, when that is not the case. The other major safeguards will continue. First, the majority of the powers need to be exercised by special directions, which are disallowable instruments tabled in the House of Representatives, while one (the ability to suspend applications) requires an Order in Council. Second, the decision maker must be satisfied that the exercise of the power (such as the making of the special direction) is reasonably necessary to manage the effects or deal with the consequences of— the outbreak of COVID-19; or measures under enactments to contain or mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19 or its effects; or other measures (in New Zealand or elsewhere) to contain or mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19 or its effects. Finally, the majority of the powers can only be exercised to benefit (or at least not disadvantage) visa holders. The major exception to this, the power to suspend the ability of certain offshore persons from making temporary entry class visa applications, has a further safeguard in that the power must be exercised by regulation. Part 2 of the Bill (modifications of principal Act in connection with temporary powers) extends, to the close of 15 May 2023, the repeal date of a series of modifications made to the principal Act in the light of the temporary powers relating to visas. The Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment is required to prepare a disclosure statement to assist with the scrutiny of this Bill. The disclosure statement provides access to information about the policy development of the Bill and identifies any significant or unusual legislative features of the Bill. http://legislation.govt.nz/disclosure.aspx?type=bill&subtype=government&year=2021&no=24 The Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Act 2020 (the Amendment Act 2020) inserted into the Immigration Act 2009 (the principal Act) provisions responding to the COVID-19 outbreak. Currently, those provisions are to be repealed on 15 May 2021 (12 months after the Amendment Act 2020 came into force). This Bill extends this date by 2 years to the close of 15 May 2023 (the new repeal date). The Bill also extends from 3 months to 6 months the period during which regulations made under section 401A of the principal Act may suspend the ability to apply for visas or submit expressions of interest. Clause 1 is the Title clause. Clause 2 provides that the Bill comes into force on the day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent. Clause 3 provides that the Bill amends the principal Act. Clause 4 amends section 50(4E) of the principal Act. The effect of the amendment is that the Minister’s powers to vary travel conditions, and to vary or cancel employment conditions of resident visas for classes of visa holders, in consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak, will now be repealed on the new repeal date. Clauses 5 and 6 amend sections 52(4E) and 53(4E) of the principal Act. The effect of the amendments is that the Minister’s powers to impose, vary, or cancel the conditions of temporary entry class visas for classes of visa holders, in consequence of the COVID-19, outbreak will now be repealed on the new repeal date. Clause 7 amends section 57(7) of the principal Act. The effect of the amendment is that the Minister’s power to waive the usual visa application requirements for classes of applicants, in consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak, will now be repealed on the new repeal date. Clause 8 amends section 61A(7) of the principal Act. The effect of the amendment is that the Minister’s power to grant visas of their own volition, in consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak, will now be repealed on the new repeal date.  Clause 9 amends section 78(2B) of the principal Act (deemed extension of temporary entry class visa expiring during epidemic) in connection with clause 10. Clause 10 amends section 78A(7) of the principal Act. The effect of the amendment is that the Minister’s power to extend temporary entry class visas by up to 6 months for classes of visa holders, in consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak, will now be repealed on the new repeal date. Clause 11 amends section 86(4C) of the principal Act. The effect of the amendment is that the Minister’s power to waive the requirement for an individual to hold a transit visa or to suspend a transit visa waiver in an individual case, in consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak, will now be repealed on the new repeal date. Clause 12 amends section 113A(8) of the principal Act. Section 113A applies if a person’s entry permission is deemed to be granted under regulations made under the principal Act. The effect of the amendment is that an immigration officer’s power to revoke entry permission if permitted or required by immigration instructions under the principal Act will now be repealed on the new repeal date. Clause 13 amends section 378 of the principal Act (special directions). The amendment is consequential on the amendments to sections 50, 52, 53, 57, 61A, and 78A. Clause 14 amends section 380 of the principal Act (delegation of Minister’s powers). The amendment is consequential on the amendments to sections 50, 52, 53, 57, 61A, and 78A.  Clause 15 amends section 401A of the principal Act. Currently, section 401A authorises regulations to be made that suspend for up to 3 months the ability to apply for a particular class or type of visa or submit an expression of interest in obtaining an invitation to apply for a particular class or type of visa. The effect of the amendments is to extend the suspension period to up to 6 months at a time and to repeal section 401A on the new repeal date. Clause 16 amends section 401B of the principal Act. The amendment is connected to the amendment to section 401A and has the effect that section 401B will be repealed on the new repeal date. Clause 17 amends section 403B. The effect of the amendment is that the modifications in Schedule 6 of the principal Act, which apply in connection with the amendments made in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, are now repealed on the new repeal date.  This Act is the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Act 2021. This Act comes into force on the day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent.

This Act is repealed on the expiry of a relevant period if no resolution is passed to continue the Act by the House of Representatives within that period. The relevant period is the longer of the following: the period of 90 days after the commencement date or the date of the most recent resolution referred to in subsection (1): any other period specified by a resolution of the House of Representatives. If not repealed sooner under subsection (1), this Act is repealed on the date that is 2 years after the date of its commencement. The purpose of this Act is to support a public health response to COVID-19 that— prevents, and limits the risk of, the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 (taking into account the infectious nature and potential for asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19); and avoids, mitigates, or remedies the actual or potential adverse effects of the COVID-19 outbreak (whether direct or indirect); and is co-ordinated, orderly, and proportionate; and allows social, economic, and other factors to be taken into account where it is relevant to do so; and is economically sustainable and allows for the recovery of MIQF costs; and has enforceable measures, in addition to the relevant voluntary measures and public health and other guidance that also support that response. In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— authorised person means a person authorised under section 18 Commissioner has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Policing Act 2008 constable has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Policing Act 2008 COVID-19 order means an order made under section 11 (as may be amended or extended from time to time under section 15) Director-General means the Director-General of Health district has the meaning given to it by section 5(1) of the Local Government Act 2002 enforcement officer means— the Director-General: a medical officer of health: a constable: in relation to any function or power, a person authorised to perform that function or power under section 18 or a person in a class of persons authorised to perform that function or power under section 18 infringement offence means an infringement offence against section 26(3) managed isolation or quarantine facility or MIQF means a facility that is designated by the New Zealand Government for use as a place of isolation or quarantine MBIE means the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment Minister means the Minister who, under the authority of any warrant or with the authority of the Prime Minister, is responsible for the administration of this Act MIQF costs means costs incurred by the New Zealand Government in respect of persons staying at MIQFs New Zealand includes all waters within the outer limits of the territorial sea of New Zealand (as defined by section 3 of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977) Police uniform has the meaning given to it by section 4 of the Policing Act 2008 premises includes any commercial premises and private premises prescribed charge means a charge prescribed by regulations made under section 33A public place has the meaning given to it by section 2(1) of the Summary Offences Act 1981 relevant Minister means the Minister of the Crown who, under the authority of any warrant or with the authority of the Prime Minister, is responsible for the administration of subpart 3A of Part 2 road has the meaning given to it by section 35(2) of the Policing Act 2008 territorial authority has the meaning given to it by section 5(1) of the Local Government Act 2002. Terms and expressions used and not defined in this Act, but defined in the Health Act 1956, have the same meanings as in the Health Act 1956. The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. This Act binds the Crown. A COVID-19 order may be made under this Act only— while an epidemic notice under section 5 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 is in force for COVID-19; or while a state of emergency or transition period in respect of COVID-19 under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 is in force; or if the Prime Minister, by notice in the Gazette, after being satisfied that there is a risk of an outbreak or the spread of COVID-19, has authorised the use of COVID-19 orders (either generally or specifically) and the authorisation is in force. The Minister may make a COVID-19 order in accordance with the following provisions: the Minister must have had regard to advice from the Director-General about— the risks of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19; and  the nature and extent of measures (whether voluntary or enforceable) that are appropriate to address those risks; and the Minister may have had regard to any decision by the Government on the level of public health measures appropriate to respond to those risks and avoid, mitigate, or remedy the effects of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 (which decision may have taken into account any social, economic, or other factors); and the Minister must be satisfied that the order does not limit or is a justified limit on the rights and freedoms in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990; and the Minister— must have consulted the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Minister of Health; and may have consulted any other Minister that the Minister (as defined in this Act) thinks fit; and before making the order, the Minister must be satisfied that the order is appropriate to achieve the purpose of this Act. Nothing in this section requires the Minister to receive specific advice from the Director-General about the content of a proposed order or proposal to amend, extend, or revoke an order. The Director-General may make a COVID-19 order that meets both of the following requirements: the order may apply only within the boundaries of a single territorial authority district: in the opinion of the Director-General, the order— is urgently needed to prevent or contain the outbreak or spread of COVID-19; and is the most appropriate way of addressing those matters at the time. The Minister or Director-General may in accordance with section 9 or 10 (as the case may be) make an order under this section for 1 or more of the following purposes: to require persons to refrain from taking any specified actions that contribute or are likely to contribute to the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19, or require persons to take any specified actions, or comply with any specified measures, that contribute or are likely to contribute to preventing the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19, including (without limitation) requiring persons to do any of the following: stay in any specified place or refrain from going to any specified place: refrain from associating with specified persons: stay physically distant from any persons in any specified way: refrain from travelling to or from any specified area: refrain from carrying out specified activities (for example, business activities involving close personal contact) or require specified activities to be carried out only in any specified way or in compliance with specified measures: be isolated or quarantined in any specified place or in any specified way: refrain from participating in gatherings of any specified kind, in any specified place, or in specified circumstances: report for and undergo a medical examination or testing of any kind, and at any place or time, specified and in any specified way or specified circumstances: provide, in specified circumstances or in any specified way, any information necessary for the purpose of contact tracing: satisfy any specified criteria before entering New Zealand from a place outside New Zealand, which may include being registered to enter an MIQF on arrival in New Zealand: in relation to any places, premises, crafts, vehicles, animals, or other things, to require specified actions to be taken, require compliance with any specified measures, or impose specified prohibitions that contribute or are likely to contribute to preventing the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19, including (without limitation) any of the following: require things to be closed or only open if specified measures are complied with: prohibit things from entering any port or place, or permit the entry of things into any port or place only if specified measures are complied with: prohibit gatherings of any specified kind in any specified places or premises, or in any specified circumstances: require things to be isolated, quarantined, or disinfected in any specified way or specified circumstances: require the testing of things in any specified way or specified circumstances. An order made by the Minister may specify which breaches of an order made by the Minister or the Director-General are infringement offences for the purposes of section 26(3). For the purpose of this section and section 12, things means any things mentioned in subsection (1)﻿(b), including places, premises, ports, crafts, vehicles, and animals. A COVID-19 order may— impose different measures for different circumstances and different classes of persons or things: apply,— in relation to people, generally to all people in New Zealand or to any specified class of people in New Zealand: in relation to things that can be specified under section 11, to any class of those things or to all of those things: in relation to anything else,— generally throughout New Zealand: in any area, however described: exempt (with or without conditions) from compliance with or the application of any provisions of the order any person or thing or class of persons or things: authorise any person or class of persons to— grant an exemption (with or without conditions) referred to in paragraph (c); or authorise (with or without conditions) a specified activity that would otherwise be prohibited by the order: if any thing can be prohibited under section 11, permit that thing but only subject to specified conditions. However, a COVID-19 order— may not apply only to a specific individual: if made by the Director-General, may apply only within the boundaries of a single territorial authority district: may not be made under section 11(1)﻿(b)﻿(i) in relation to— any premises that are, or any part of any premises that is, used solely as a private dwellinghouse: any premises that are, or are part of, a prison (within the meaning of section 3(1) of the Corrections Act 2004): may not be made under section 11(1)﻿(b)﻿(i) or (iii) in relation to— any premises within the parliamentary precincts (within the meaning of section 3 of the Parliamentary Service Act 2000): any premises whose principal or only use is as a courtroom or Judge’s chambers or a court registry. A breach of a condition of an exemption or a condition of an authorisation is a breach of the provision of the order to which that exemption or authorisation relates. A COVID-19 order may not be held invalid just because— it is, or authorises any act or omission that is, inconsistent with the Health Act 1956 or any other enactment relevant to the subject matter of the order; or it confers any discretion on, or allows any matter to be determined, approved, or exempted by any person. However, subsection (1)﻿(a) does not limit or affect the application of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. To avoid doubt, nothing in this Act prevents the filing, hearing, or determination of any legal proceedings in respect of the making or terms of any COVID-19 order. A COVID-19 order must— be in writing; and state the area to which it applies; and state when it comes into force. A COVID-19 order must, at least 48 hours before it comes into force,— be published on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government; and be notified in the Gazette. However, the Minister or Director-General (as the case may be) need not comply with the 48-hour time limit in subsection (2) if satisfied that— the order should come into force urgently to prevent or contain the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 (but in that case must comply with subsection (2)﻿(a) and (b) as soon as practicable); or the effect of the order is only to remove or reduce requirements imposed by a COVID-19 order. A COVID-19 order made by the Director-General expires 1 month after the date on which it comes into force, unless it is sooner revoked or extended. The Minister and the Director-General must keep their COVID-19 orders under review. The Minister may, at any time, amend, extend, or revoke any COVID-19 order made by the Minister. The Director-General may, at any time, amend, extend by up to 1 month on each occasion, or revoke any COVID-19 order made by the Director-General. The Minister may, at any time, revoke any COVID-19 order made by the Director-General. Requirements that apply in relation to the making of a COVID-19 order also apply, with all necessary modifications, in relation to its amendment or extension. A COVID-19 order made by the Minister is revoked (unless it is earlier revoked) on the expiry of the relevant period if no resolution of the House of Representatives is passed to approve the order within that period. The relevant period is the longer of the following: the period of 10 sitting days of the House of Representatives after the date on which the order is made: the period of 60 days after the date on which the order is made: any other period specified by a resolution of the House of Representatives. An order that is revoked under subsection (1) immediately ceases to be of any effect unless a resolution of the House provides otherwise. Revocation under subsection (1) does not affect the validity of any action taken to give effect to or enforce the order. A COVID-19 order is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Legislation Act 2012 and must be presented to the House of Representatives as soon as practicable. The Director-General may authorise a suitably qualified and trained person who is employed or engaged by the Crown or a Crown entity (if specified in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Crown Entities Act 2004), or a class of suitably qualified and trained persons who are employed or engaged by the Crown or a Crown entity (if specified in Part 1 of Schedule 1 of the Crown Entities Act 2004), to carry out any functions and powers of an enforcement officer under this Act. An authorisation under subsection (1) must— be in writing; and specify— the authorised person or the class of persons; and the functions and powers that may be carried out by the authorised person or class of persons; and the term of the authorisation. The Director-General may renew any authorisation given under subsection (1). The Director-General may revoke an authorisation given under this section— in the case of an individual, for incapacity, neglect of duty, or misconduct; or in the case of an individual, on the written request of the authorised person; or if the Director-General considers that the authorisation is no longer necessary or desirable. If a person ceases to be an authorised person, they must surrender to the Director-General all articles and documents received by the person in relation to the authorisation. Every enforcement officer (other than a constable in Police uniform) exercising any of the powers conferred by or under this Act must, at the time of exercising that power, and subsequently on request, produce— evidence of that person’s appointment as an enforcement officer; and evidence of that person’s identity. An enforcement officer may enter, without a warrant, any land, building, craft, vehicle, place, or thing if they have reasonable grounds to believe that a person is failing to comply with any aspect of a COVID-19 order. However, subsection (1) does not apply to a private dwellinghouse. A constable may enter a private dwellinghouse without warrant only if they have reasonable grounds to believe that people have gathered there in contravention of a COVID-19 order and entry is necessary for the purpose of giving a direction under section 21. A constable exercising a power of entry under this section may use reasonable force in order to effect entry into or onto the land, building, craft, vehicle, place, or thing if, following a request, a person present refuses entry or does not allow entry within a reasonable time. Any constable who exercises a warrantless entry power under this section must provide a written report on the exercise of that power to the Commissioner or a Police employee designated to receive reports of that kind by the Commissioner, as soon as practicable after exercising the power. Any enforcement officer (other than a constable) who exercises a warrantless entry power under this section must provide a written report on the exercise of that power to the Director-General, or an employee designated to receive reports of that kind by the Director-General, as soon as practicable after exercising the power. A report referred to in subsection (5) or (6) must contain— a short summary of the circumstances surrounding the exercise of the power, and the reason or reasons why the power needed to be exercised; and a description of any other action undertaken. If a marae is entered under subsection (1), the person exercising the power must also send a copy of the report referred to in subsection (5) or (6) (as the case may be) to the committee of the relevant marae. An enforcement officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is contravening or likely to contravene a COVID-19 order may— direct that person to stop any activity that is contravening or likely to contravene the order: direct that person to take any action to prevent or limit the extent of the person’s non-compliance. Subsection (2) applies if a COVID-19 order provides for the total or partial prohibition or restriction of public access, with or without vehicles, to any road or public place within an area specified in the order for the purpose of this section. For the purpose of enforcing those measures contained in the order, a constable or an enforcement officer acting under the authority of the constable may totally or partially prohibit or restrict public access, with or without vehicles, to any road or public place in that area. For the purpose of a COVID-19 order that provides for restriction of movement, a constable may stop a vehicle. Sections 128 and 129 of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 (duty to remain stopped and to provide information), with any necessary modifications, apply to the powers conferred by subsection (3) and apply in addition to the requirement to provide evidence of identity in section 19﻿. For the purpose of exercising powers under this subpart, an enforcement officer may direct a person to give the person’s full name, full address, date of birth, occupation, and telephone number, or any of those particulars that the enforcement officer may specify. An enforcement officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that a business or undertaking, or part of a business or undertaking, is operating in contravention of a COVID-19 order or contrary to any conditions imposed on its operation by a COVID-19 order may direct any person who appears to be in charge of the business or undertaking, or that part, to close and cease operation until a later time stated in the direction that does not exceed 24 hours after it is given. As soon as a direction is given, the owner or manager or person to whom it is given may appeal to the District Court for the revocation of the direction.  The Court— may revoke the direction either unconditionally or subject to any conditions that it thinks fit to impose; or may refuse to revoke the direction. The filing of an appeal does not suspend, interfere with, or affect the application of the direction concerned. A direction under this subpart may be given verbally or in writing. A person commits an offence if the person intentionally fails to comply with a COVID-19 order. A person who commits an offence against subsection (1) is liable on conviction to— imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months; or a fine not exceeding $4,000. A person commits an infringement offence if the person does anything specified as an infringement offence in a COVID-19 order. A person who commits an infringement offence is liable to— an infringement fee of $300; or a fine imposed by a court not exceeding $1,000. A person commits an offence if the person obstructs or intentionally threatens, assaults, or hinders an enforcement officer in the exercise or performance of powers or functions under sections 20 to 24. A person commits an offence if the person intentionally fails to comply with a direction, prohibition, or restriction given or imposed under any of sections 21 to 24. A person commits an offence if the person— fails to stop as soon as practicable when required to do so by a constable exercising the power under section 22(3) to stop a vehicle; and knows or ought reasonably to have known that the person exercising the power is a constable. A person who commits an offence against any of subsections (1) to (3) is liable on conviction to— imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months; or a fine not exceeding $4,000. A person who is alleged to have committed an infringement offence may— be proceeded against by the filing of a charging document under section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011; or be served with an infringement notice issued under section 30. If an infringement notice has been issued under section 30, proceedings for the offence to which the notice relates may be commenced in accordance with section 21 of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, and in that case the provisions of that section apply with all necessary modifications. An enforcement officer may issue infringement notices under this Act. An enforcement officer may issue an infringement notice to a person if the officer believes on reasonable grounds that the person is committing, or has committed, an infringement offence. The enforcement officer may deliver the infringement notice (or a copy of it) in person to the person alleged to have committed an infringement offence or send the notice by post addressed to that person’s last known place of residence or business. An infringement notice (or a copy of it) sent by post to a person under subsection (2) is to be treated as having been served on that person when it was posted. An infringement notice must be in the form prescribed by regulations made under section 33 or (in the absence of a form prescribed by regulations) in form 1 set out in Schedule 3. A reminder notice must be in the form prescribed by regulations made under section 33 or (in the absence of a form prescribed by regulations) in form 2 set out in Schedule 3. All infringement fees paid in respect of infringement offences must be paid into a Crown Bank Account. The purpose of this subpart is to enable the New Zealand Government to recover MIQF costs. The relevant Minister may recommend the making of regulations under section 33A prescribing charges only if satisfied that the charges concerned relate to MIQF costs (including direct and indirect costs). The relevant Minister may recommend that regulations be made under section 33A only if the Minister is satisfied of the following matters: the prescribed charges recover from any class of persons no more than an estimate of the actual and reasonable MIQF costs incurred in relation to that class (including both direct and indirect costs); and there is appropriate provision to grant relief from the payment of the prescribed charges in circumstances where payment of the charges would cause undue financial hardship; and the prescribed charges do not limit or are justified limits on the rights and freedoms in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The methods by which MIQF costs may be recovered are as follows: fixed charges, or a method of calculating or ascertaining the charges: charges based on a scale or formula or at a rate determined on a unit basis: charges based on costs incurred from third parties: charges of estimated actual and reasonable costs to be spent on or in connection with the use of an MIQF. Without limiting the way in which a charge may be set, a charge may be set at a level or in a way that— is determined by calculations that involve an averaging of costs: takes account of costs or potential costs that are not directly incurred in relation to the use of an MIQF by the person paying the charge, but which are costs or potential costs arising indirectly in relation to the use of an MIQF by 1 or more classes of persons. A prescribed charge is payable by or on behalf of a person, in accordance with regulations made under section 33A, if— the person— has arrived in New Zealand from a place outside New Zealand and is required by or under a COVID-19 order to stay at an MIQF; and is a member of any prescribed class of persons; and is not an exempt person; or the person— has elected to enter an MIQF for isolation or quarantine; and is not an exempt person. An exempt person is a person who— is, for the time being, accorded privileges and immunities under— the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations in accordance with the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968; or the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations in accordance with the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1971; or is officially recognised as accompanying family of a person described in paragraph (a); or is an official of a government entity travelling to New Zealand to conduct business with— New Zealand Ministers of the Crown; or a ministry or department of the New Zealand Government; or is a holder of a diplomatic or other official passport entering or transiting through New Zealand— en route to, or returning from, a diplomatic posting in a country other than New Zealand; or for the purpose of assisting with the operations of the embassy or consulate (in New Zealand or elsewhere) of the country for which the person holds a passport on which the person is travelling; or is an official of a government entity entering or transiting through New Zealand en route to, or returning from, a third country— where the purpose of the visit to the third country was or is to conduct official government-to-government business; and the person is able to provide evidence to verify that purpose; or is, or is a member of a class of persons that is, exempted by or under regulations made under section 33A from paying the prescribed charges. Regulations made under section 33A may provide for exemptions from, or waivers or refunds of, the whole or part of any prescribed charge in any class or classes of cases. Regulations made under section 33A may authorise the relevant Minister or the chief executive of MBIE to exempt, waive, or refund the whole or part of any prescribed charge, or defer the time for payment, in any particular case or any class or classes of cases (and may or may not prescribe criteria to be applied by the relevant Minister or the chief executive in doing so). A prescribed charge is payable by a person— in the manner prescribed (for example, by instalments); and at the time prescribed. Regulations made under section 33A may authorise the chief executive of MBIE to specify in relation to 1 or more classes of persons, or all persons, the manner and time of payment of any prescribed charge. All prescribed charges received by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government must be paid into a Crown Bank Account. To the extent that this subpart and any regulations made under section 33A enable the relevant Minister or the chief executive of MBIE on behalf of the Crown to lend money (as that term is defined in section 2(1) of the Public Finance Act 1989) to a person or organisation, this subpart is an express authorisation for the purpose of section 65K of that Act. A prescribed charge or part of a charge that is not paid by the due date is recoverable in a court of competent jurisdiction as a debt to the Crown. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, make regulations— prescribing the form of infringement notices and reminder notices, and the information to be included in the notices: providing for any other matters contemplated by this Act, necessary for its administration, or necessary for giving it full effect. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the relevant Minister made after consultation with the Minister (as defined in this Act),— make regulations prescribing charges for MIQF costs in accordance with the provisions of subpart 3A: make regulations for the purposes of section 32E: make regulations for the purposes of section 32F: make regulations for the purposes of section 32G: make regulations prescribing how the charges may be collected: make regulations providing for the payment of increased or additional charges in the event of late payment or non-payment: make regulations providing for any other matters necessary or desirable for the efficient recovery of MIQF costs. The charges may be prescribed using any 1 or more of the methods specified in section 32D, or any combination of those methods. Different charges, or different rates or types of charges, may be prescribed in respect of— different classes of persons: persons in different circumstances: different types of MIQFs: different locations of MIQFs. Any regulations made under this section may not be held invalid just because they confer a discretion on, or allow any matter to be determined by, any person whether or not there are prescribed criteria. Section 129 of the Health Act 1956 (which relates to the protection of persons acting under authority of that Act) applies as if that Act included a reference to this Act. However, this section does not limit any other protections from liability that apply under any other enactment. This Part amends the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. After section 66(3), insert: Despite subsection (3), if a state of national emergency for COVID-19 is declared after the commencement of this subsection, subsection (3) does not terminate any local state of emergency for other emergencies that are not related to COVID-19. Subsection (4) is repealed when the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 is repealed. After section 68(5), insert: Nothing in this section authorises a state of local emergency to be declared for COVID-19 without the prior approval of the Minister, but this subsection does not prevent a state of local emergency being declared for any purpose that is not related to COVID-19. Despite subsection (5), if a state of national emergency is in force for COVID-19, subsection (5) does not prevent a state of local emergency being declared for any other emergency that is not related to COVID-19. Subsections (6) and (7) are repealed when the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 is repealed. After section 94B(11), insert: Nothing in this section authorises notice of a local transition period to be given for any part of New Zealand for COVID-19 without the prior approval of the Minister, but this subsection does not prevent notice of a local transition period being given for any other purpose. Despite subsection (11), if a national transition period is in force for COVID-19, subsection (11) does not prevent a local transition period being given for any other emergency that is not related to COVID-19. Subsections (12) and (13) are repealed when the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 is repealed. After section 94E(7), insert: Subsection (7) does not terminate any national transition period that relates to COVID-19 if a state of local emergency is declared as a result of an emergency that is not related to COVID-19. Subsection (8) is repealed when the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 is repealed. This Part amends the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989. After section 272(3)﻿(ba), insert: an infringement offence against the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020; or In section 272(5), replace “Notwithstanding subsection (3)﻿(ba) or (c) or (d), where a young person is charged with an infringement offence referred to in subsection (3)﻿(ba) or a traffic offence that is an infringement offence referred to in subsection (3)﻿(c) or an infringement offence referred to in subsection (3)﻿(d)” with “Notwithstanding subsection (3)﻿(ba), (bb), (c), or (d), where a young person is charged with an infringement offence referred to in subsection (3)﻿(ba) or an infringement offence against the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 referred to in subsection (3)﻿(bb) or a traffic offence that is an infringement offence referred to in subsection (3)﻿(c) or an infringement offence referred to in subsection (3)﻿(d)”. Every order made under section 70 of the Health Act 1956 that is listed in Schedule 2 and every amendment or extension of the order— continues in force as if made under this Act for the purposes of amending, extending, revoking, or enforcing it; and may be amended, extended, or revoked by a COVID-19 order made by the Minister; and may be enforced as if it were a COVID-19 order. To avoid doubt, nothing in this Act prevents the filing, hearing, or determination of any legal proceedings in respect of the making or terms of any order listed in Schedule 2. Any action taken before the enactment or commencement of this Act by or on behalf of the Minister or Director-General or the Government in relation to a COVID-19 order must be treated as having been taken by the relevant person under and for the purposes of this Act (as if this Act was already enacted and in force). However, section 14(2) does not apply to the first COVID-19 order made under this Act. Nothing in this Act affects any proceedings commenced before the commencement of this Act, and those proceedings must be decided as if this Act had not been enacted. Section 68(7) of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 applies in relation to a state of national emergency that is already in force at the commencement of that provision as if that provision were in force when the emergency was declared. Section 94E(8) of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 applies in relation to a national transition period relating to COVID-19 that is already in force at the commencement of that provision as if that provision were in force when notice of the transition period was given.

2021-04-15T18:01:14,COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track Consenting) Act 2020," This Act is the COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track Consenting) Act 2020. This Act comes into force on the day after it receives the Royal assent. This Act is repealed on the second anniversary of the date on which it receives the Royal assent.

Terms used in this Act that are not defined in this Act have the same meanings as they have in the Resource Management Act 1991, if they are defined in that Act. Terms used in this Act that are not defined in this Act have the same meanings as they have in the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, if they are defined in that Act and not in the Resource Management Act 1991 (but modified as applicable if the Ngā Rohe Moana o Ngā Hapū o Ngāti Porou Act 2019 applies). The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. This Act binds the Crown. Every person performing functions and exercising powers under this Act must take all practicable steps to use timely, efficient, consistent, and cost-effective processes that are proportionate to the functions, duties, or powers being performed or exercised. This includes a duty to act promptly in circumstances where no time limit has been set for the performance or exercise of a function, power, duty, or requirement under this Act. However, a failure to comply with this section does not of itself invalidate the performance of a function or duty or the exercise of a power under this Act. This section applies to any document that is to be served on a person for the purpose of this Act, including— an application; and comments sought on any matter; and notice of a decision and any document related to the decision; and written notice of any other matter. Unless it is impracticable to do so, the document must be sent electronically to the electronic address provided for that purpose. Any time frame that applies under this Act, and that is expressed in relation to when notice is given, or an application made, or comments sought, must be calculated, if the document is sent electronically, from the date of electronic receipt. However, subsection (2)— does not apply to a document that is to be served on a person to commence, or in the course of, court proceedings if the court requires a different method of service (whether expressly or in its rules or practices); and does not override the provisions of the Electronic Courts and Tribunals Act 2016. If electronic service of the document is impracticable, the document may be served in accordance with section 352(1)﻿(b) and (2) to (5), and, if applicable, section 353, of the Resource Management Act 1991. This section applies except as otherwise provided in, or required by the context of, this Act. If an application for resource consent for an activity is made under this Act,— the process for obtaining a consent under Schedule 6 applies instead of the process for obtaining a consent under the Resource Management Act 1991; and a resource consent granted under this Act has the same force and effect for its duration, and according to its terms and conditions, as if it were granted under the Resource Management Act 1991. If a notice of requirement is lodged under this Act,— the process for confirming or modifying a designation under Schedule 6 applies instead of the process for confirming or modifying a designation under the Resource Management Act 1991; and a designation confirmed or modified under this Act has the same force and effect for its duration, and according to its terms and conditions, as if it were confirmed or modified under the Resource Management Act 1991. A certificate of compliance issued by a panel under clause 27 of Schedule 6 has the same force and effect as if it were issued by a consent authority under section 139 of the Resource Management Act 1991. If an activity is undertaken, in reliance on this Act, as a permitted activity in the course of work on infrastructure,— subpart 2 of Part 2 and Schedule 4 apply to the activity despite anything to the contrary in— the relevant plan or proposed plan; or the Resource Management (National Environmental Standard for Assessing and Managing Contaminants in Soil to Protect Human Health) Regulations 2011; but the permitted activities and associated permitted activity standards in Schedule 4 do not override or replace— any other national environmental standard; or any conditions that apply to an existing resource consent or designation. Subsections (7) and (8) apply where— an activity is already classified as a permitted activity under the relevant plan or proposed plan, or under the Resource Management (National Environmental Standard for Assessing and Managing Contaminants in Soil to Protect Human Health) Regulations 2011 (the regulations); and a resource consent is not required for the activity if it complies with the requirements, conditions, and permissions, if any, specified in the plan or the regulations (the existing requirements, conditions, and permissions). If the existing requirements, conditions, and permissions are more stringent than the applicable permitted activity standards,— the activity may be undertaken in the course of work on infrastructure as a permitted activity in reliance on this Act, subject to the conditions in section 29(2); and subsection (5) applies in respect of the activity. However, if the existing requirements, conditions, and permissions are more lenient than the applicable permitted activity standards, the activity may be undertaken in the course of work on infrastructure in reliance on the plan or the regulations rather than in reliance on this Act. Every person who carries out an activity as part of a listed project or a referred project, or in the course of work on infrastructure, is subject to— the duty to avoid unreasonable noise under section 16 of the Resource Management Act 1991; and the duty to avoid, remedy, or mitigate adverse effects under section 17 of the Resource Management Act 1991. The provisions of the Resource Management Act 1991 otherwise apply, to the extent that they are relevant and with any necessary modifications, to a listed project or a referred project and to any activity carried out as a permitted activity in the course of work on infrastructure. Nothing in this Act limits or affects any right of judicial review a person may have in respect of any matter to which this Act applies. However, if a person wishes to apply for judicial review of a final decision of a panel under clause 37 of Schedule 6 and also appeal to the High Court against the same decision, the person must lodge the applications for judicial review and appeal together, unless the High Court grants leave for the person to lodge the applications separately. If an application for judicial review and an appeal are lodged together, the High Court must try to hear the proceedings together, but need not if the court considers it impracticable to do so in the circumstances of the particular case. An expert consenting panel must be appointed under Schedule 5 for— each project described in Schedule 2 (a listed project); and each project or part-project referred to an expert consenting panel in accordance with this subpart (a referred project). An authorised person for a listed project or a referred project— may apply under this Act, instead of under the Resource Management Act 1991, for a resource consent relating to the project; and may, if the person is a requiring authority, lodge a notice of requirement under this Act, instead of under the Resource Management Act 1991, for a designation or to alter a designation relating to the project. The authorised person for a project is,— for a listed project,— any person or entity authorised to undertake the project, as identified in Schedule 2; and if that person or entity is KiwiRail Holdings Limited, the New Zealand Transport Agency, or a government department, any person they authorise to act on their behalf for the purposes of this Act; and for a referred project, the person identified as the authorised person in the Order in Council made under section 27 (the referral order). Schedule 6 sets out— the requirements for consent applications to be made to, and notices of requirement to be lodged with, the EPA; and how the EPA provides applications and notices of requirement to the panel appointed for a project; and how the panel makes decisions. To avoid doubt, a person— cannot apply under this Act for a change or cancellation of an existing consent (see section 127 of the Resource Management Act 1991); but may lodge a notice of requirement under this Act to alter an existing designation. Decisions under this subpart that relate to the referral of a project to an expert consenting panel must be made— jointly by the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of Conservation, if any part of the project would occur in the coastal marine area; or by the Minister for the Environment alone in any other case. In relation to a decision that must be made jointly by both Ministers, any reference in this subpart to the Minister must be read as if it were a reference to both Ministers. The Minister’s obligations under section 6 (Treaty of Waitangi), as they apply to a decision under section 24 to refer a project to an expert consenting panel, are satisfied if the Minister, before making the decision, obtains and considers a report on the application for referral that is prepared in accordance with this section. The report must be prepared by the Ministry in consultation with the Office for Māori Crown Relations—Te Arawhiti. The report must identify the following: the relevant iwi authorities and relevant Treaty settlement entities: the Treaty settlements that relate to the project area: the relevant principles and provisions in those Treaty settlements, including those that relate to the composition of a decision-making body for the purposes of the Resource Management Act 1991: any recognised negotiation mandates for, or current negotiations for, Treaty settlements that relate to the project area: any court orders that recognise, in relation to the project area, protected customary rights or customary marine title, whether the court orders are granted under the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 or another Act. A project is not eligible to be referred to an expert consenting panel unless it meets all the criteria set out in this section. The Minister must be satisfied that the project will help to achieve the purpose of this Act (see section 19). The project must not include any of the following activities: an activity that is described as a prohibited activity in the Resource Management Act 1991, regulations made under that Act (including a national environmental standard), or a plan or proposed plan: an activity that— would occur on land returned under a Treaty settlement; and has not been agreed to in writing by the relevant landowner: an activity that— would occur in a customary marine title area under the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011; and has not been agreed to in writing by the holder of the relevant customary marine title order issued under that Act: an activity that— would occur in a protected customary rights area under the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 and have a more than minor adverse effect on the exercise of the protected customary right; and has not been agreed to in writing by the holder of a relevant protected customary rights recognition order issued under that Act. To avoid doubt,— a project may be in the form of a single large project or any number of related projects, and the projects may cross local authority boundaries; and even if a project or part of a project meets all the criteria in this section, the Minister may decide not to refer it to an expert consenting panel (see section 23). In considering, for the purpose of section 18(2), whether a project will help to achieve the purpose of this Act, the Minister may have regard to the following matters, assessed at whatever level of detail the Minister considers appropriate: the project’s economic benefits and costs for people or industries affected by COVID-19: the project’s effect on the social and cultural well-being of current and future generations: whether the project would be likely to progress faster by using the processes provided by this Act than would otherwise be the case: whether the project may result in a public benefit by, for example,— generating employment: increasing housing supply: contributing to well-functioning urban environments: providing infrastructure in order to improve economic, employment, and environmental outcomes, and increase productivity: improving environmental outcomes for coastal or freshwater quality, air quality, or indigenous biodiversity: minimising waste: contributing to New Zealand’s efforts to mitigate climate change and transition more quickly to a low-emissions economy (in terms of reducing New Zealand’s net emissions of greenhouse gases): promoting the protection of historic heritage: strengthening environmental, economic, and social resilience, in terms of managing the risks from natural hazards and the effects of climate change: whether there is potential for the project to have significant adverse environmental effects, including greenhouse gas emissions: any other matter that the Minister considers relevant. Any person may apply to the Minister for a project to be referred to an expert consenting panel. The application— must include the information specified in subsection (3); but need only provide a general level of detail, sufficient to inform the Minister’s decision on the application, as opposed to the level of detail that an expert consenting panel would require to be provided in applications for resource consents or in notices of requirement. The information to be included in the application is as follows: a description of the proposed project and the activities it involves: the approximate geographical location of the project (which may be included in the form of a map): the anticipated commencement and completion dates for construction activities (where relevant): a statement of whether the project is planned to proceed in stages and, if so, an outline of the nature and timing of the staging: a description of the anticipated and known adverse effects of the project on the environment: a general assessment of the project in relation to national policy statements and national environmental standards (as those terms are defined in the Resource Management Act 1991): an explanation of how the project meets the criteria in section 18: a list of the persons the applicant considers are likely to be affected by the project, including relevant local authorities, relevant iwi authorities, and relevant Treaty settlement entities: a summary of any consultation already undertaken on the project with the persons referred to in paragraph (h): a list of any Treaty settlements that apply to the geographical location of the project, and a summary of the relevant principles and provisions in those settlements: a description of the applicant’s legal interest (if any) in the land on which the project will occur, including a statement of how that affects the applicant’s ability to undertake the work: an outline of the types of resource consents and any designations, or changes to designations, that the applicant considers are needed to authorise the project, including any that the applicant considers may be needed by someone other than the applicant: a description of other legal authorisations (other than contractual) that the applicant considers may be required to commence the project (for example, authorities under the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014 or concessions under the Conservation Act 1987): a statement of whether the applicant has already made consent applications or lodged notices of requirement under the Resource Management Act 1991 in respect of the same or a similar project and, if so, details of those applications and notices and any decisions made on them: a description of whether and how the project would be affected by climate change and natural hazards: a summary of compliance or enforcement actions (if any) taken against the applicant by a local authority or the EPA under the Resource Management Act 1991, and the outcome of those actions. The Secretary for the Environment must approve an application form for the purpose of this section and ensure that it is made available on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the Ministry. The application must be made in the approved form. This section applies if the Minister receives an application under section 20. Unless the Minister decides to decline the application before inviting comments (see section 23), the Minister must copy the application to, and invite written comments from,— the relevant local authorities; and the relevant Ministers. The Minister may also copy the application to, and invite written comments from, any other person. Anyone who is invited to provide written comments under this section has 10 working days from the receipt of the copy of the application to do so. The Minister is not required to consider any comments received after that time, but may do so, in the Minister’s absolute discretion, as long as the Minister has not already made decisions on the application. In this section, relevant Minister means the Minister of the Crown who, under the authority of any warrant or with the authority of the Prime Minister, is responsible for any of the following Portfolios: Arts, Culture, and Heritage: Conservation: Climate Change: Defence: Education: Housing: Infrastructure: Land Information: Local Government: Māori Crown Relations—Te Arawhiti: Transport: Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations: Urban Development: any other Portfolio to which the Minister considers the application is relevant. The Minister may request further information about an application for referral from the applicant or the relevant local authorities, to be provided within the time frame specified in the request. The Minister is not required to consider any information provided after that time, but may do so, in the Minister’s absolute discretion, as long as the Minister has not already made decisions on the application. A request may be made at any time before a decision on the application is made under section 23 or 24. The Minister must decline an application for referral if the Minister is satisfied that a project does not meet the referral criteria in section 18. The Minister may decline an application for any other reason, whether or not the project meets the referral criteria. A decision to decline an application may be made— before or after a report on the application is obtained under section 17; and before or after comments on the application are invited under section 21; and whether or not further information on the application is requested and provided under section 22. However, if a report has been obtained, or if comments or further information have been sought and provided within the required time frame, the Minister must consider those things, along with the application, before deciding to decline the application. Reasons to decline an application under subsection (2) include, without limitation,— the applicant has not provided enough information for the Minister to determine whether the project meets the criteria in section 18: it would be more appropriate for the project, or part of the project, to go through the standard consenting or designation process under the Resource Management Act 1991: the project is inconsistent with a relevant national policy statement: directing the project to a panel would be inconsistent with a Treaty settlement: the project involves an activity that would occur on land that the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations considers necessary for Treaty settlement purposes: the applicant has a poor history of environmental regulatory compliance: there is insufficient time for the application to be referred and considered before this Act is repealed. Subsection (5) does not prevent the Minister from accepting an application even if 1 or more of those reasons apply. A decision under this section may be made in respect of all or part of the project that is the subject of an application for referral, and the Minister may decline some parts of an application and accept others. Before deciding to accept an application for referral, the Minister must consider— the application; and the report obtained under section 17; and any comments received under section 21 within the required time frame; and any further information requested and provided under section 22 within the required time frame. If the Minister is satisfied that all or part of a project meets the referral criteria in section 18, the Minister may decide— to refer all or part of a project to an expert consenting panel: to refer the initial stages of a project to the panel while deferring decisions about the project’s remaining stages: to specify restrictions that apply to the project (for example, on its geographical location, duration, or the activities that comprise the project): to specify information that must be submitted to the panel— with a consent application (in addition to the information required by clause 9 of Schedule 6); or with a notice of requirement (in addition to the information required by clause 13 of Schedule 6): to specify persons or groups, in addition to those specified in clause 17 of Schedule 6, from whom the panel must invite comments on a consent application or notice of requirement relating to the project: to set specific time frames for the panel to process a resource consent or notice of requirement, which may differ from the time frames specified in clause 37 of Schedule 6. A decision under this section may be made in respect of all or part of the project that is the subject of an application for referral, and the Minister may accept some parts of an application and decline others. The Minister must give notice of the decisions made on an application for referral, and the reasons for them, to— the applicant; and anyone invited to comment on the application under section 21. If the decisions include a decision to refer all or part of the project to an expert consenting panel, the Minister must also give notice of the decisions and reasons to— the EPA; and the panel convener appointed under clause 2 of Schedule 5; and the relevant iwi authorities and Treaty settlement entities identified in the report obtained under section 17; and any other iwi authorities or Treaty settlement entities that the Minister considers have an interest in the matter; and any group that is a party to— a joint management agreement under the Resource Management Act 1991 that relates to the project area; or a Mana Whakahono a Rohe entered into under the Resource Management Act 1991 that relates to the project area. After making decisions on an application for referral, the Minister must ensure that the decisions, the reasons for them, and the report obtained under section 17 are made available to the public by publishing them on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the Ministry. This section applies if the Minister decides to refer a project or part of a project to an expert consenting panel. The Minister must— recommend that a referral order be made under section 27 to give effect to the Minister’s decisions under section 24; and provide to the EPA, and to the panel convener appointed under clause 2 of Schedule 5, all the information received by the Minister that relates to the matter, including— the report obtained under section 17; and any comments received under section 21. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council (a referral order), refer a project or part of a project to an expert consenting panel. A referral order may only be made on the recommendation of the Minister and must give effect to the Minister’s decisions under section 24. A referral order must comply with the requirements set out in Schedule 3. A referral order may be amended by Order in Council,— in the case of a substantive amendment, only if an application for referral is made and considered under this subpart for the project as amended; and in the case of an amendment to correct a minor error or omission, without any need for an application to be made or considered under this subpart and without having to comply with the requirements set out in Schedule 3. The purpose of this section is to ensure that the functions of the EPA, as set out in section 13 of the Environmental Protection Authority Act 2011 (the EPA Act), include the function of exercising the powers, and carrying out the functions and duties, conferred on it by or under this Act. For the purpose of section 13(b) of the EPA Act, the definition of environmental Act in section 5 of the EPA Act must be treated as if it included a reference to this Act. In the course of work on infrastructure, certain activities may be undertaken as permitted activities (that is, activities for which a resource consent is not required under the Resource Management Act 1991). However,— the work must meet the criteria set out in section 30; and the activities must meet the criteria set out in section 31 (which include not being excluded by section 32); and the agency must comply with section 33 before commencing the work. See section 12(5) to (8), which clarifies the relationship between this subpart and the Resource Management Act 1991, relevant plans or proposed plans, and national environmental standards. See section 34, which provides for Schedule 4 to be amended by Order in Council. For the purposes of this subpart, work on infrastructure must meet all the criteria set out in this section. The work may only be carried out by the following agencies: KiwiRail Holdings Limited: the New Zealand Transport Agency: the following agencies, if they are added to clause 1 of Schedule 4 by an Order in Council made under section 34: Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities: the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development: any local authority. The work may only be carried out on existing infrastructure. The work may only be carried out at a place that meets the location requirements that apply to the agency, as set out in Schedule 4. In this section, existing infrastructure means infrastructure that is completed and operational before the commencement of this Act. For an agency that undertakes work on infrastructure in reliance on this subpart, an activity is a permitted activity if— the activity is— identified in Schedule 4 as a permitted activity for the agency; and not excluded from being a permitted activity by section 32; and the agency, when carrying out the activity, complies with the permitted activity standards that apply to the agency, as set out in Schedule 4. This section sets out the activities that are excluded from being permitted activities for the purpose of this subpart. An activity is excluded if it is a discretionary, non-complying, or prohibited activity under— the relevant plan or proposed plan; or the Resource Management (National Environmental Standard for Assessing and Managing Contaminants in Soil to Protect Human Health) Regulations 2011. An activity is excluded if it would occur in any of the following places: a place identified or listed in the relevant plan or proposed plan as— a wāhi tapu; or any other site of cultural or historical significance; or an outstanding water body: a wāhi tapu identified for the purpose of this section during the engagement process required by clause 5 of Schedule 4. An activity is excluded if it would involve a non-temporary take of water that would require a resource consent under the relevant plan or proposed plan. An activity is excluded if it would be contrary to a water conservation order (as defined in section 200 of the Resource Management Act 1991). An activity is excluded if it can be undertaken within the scope of an existing designation without requiring— an outline plan of works to be lodged under section 176A of the Resource Management Act 1991; or a consent under the relevant regional plan or proposed regional plan. An activity is excluded to the extent that it has an existing resource consent. An agency seeking to carry out work on infrastructure in reliance on this subpart must— begin the iwi and hapū engagement process required by clauses 5 to 7 of Schedule 4 at least 30 working days before the work commences; and serve notices of intention in accordance with clauses 8 and 9 of Schedule 4 at least 10 working days before the work commences. The agency must also comply with any other applicable permitted activity standard that requires something to be done before the work commences. The Minister must not recommend that an Order in Council be made under this section unless the Minister is satisfied that— the change made by the order will help to achieve the purpose of this Act; and the recommendation is consistent with section 6 (Treaty of Waitangi). The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister, amend clause 1 of Schedule 4 to add any of the following as an agency that may carry out work on infrastructure in reliance on this Act (see section 30(2)): Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities: the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development: any local authority. The order must also amend Schedule 4 to— set the location requirements for the agency’s work on infrastructure; and specify the permitted activities for the agency; and specify any activities, in addition to those listed in section 32, that are excluded from being permitted activities for the agency; and specify the permitted activity standards that apply to the agency. A local authority may— monitor activities carried out as permitted activities in reliance on this subpart, if the activities are located in the authority’s region or district; and take appropriate action using the methods available to it under the Resource Management Act 1991. A local authority may fix charges, payable by agencies carrying out work on infrastructure, for monitoring the activities. Sections 36(1A) to (8), 36AAA, and 36AAB of the Resource Management Act 1991 apply to the fixing of charges under subsection (2). A local authority may rely on charges fixed under section 36(1)﻿(c) of the Resource Management Act 1991 (which relate to resource consent and resource management functions) to recover the costs of carrying out its functions under this subpart. An Order in Council made under this Act is revoked on the day this Act is repealed. This Act, and any Order in Council made under this Act that is in force on the day before the Act is repealed, remains in force for the purpose of completing any matter commenced under the Act before its repeal or under the order before its revocation. The matters referred to in subclause (2) include, without limitation,— a panel’s decision on a consent application or notice of requirement that is lodged with a panel, in accordance with clause 2 of Schedule 6, before the date that is 6 months after the repeal of this Act: the issue of a certificate of compliance by a panel, if the certificate is requested before the date that is 6 months after the repeal of this Act: the filing, hearing, determination, or withdrawal of an appeal or a judicial review in relation to a decision on a consent application or notice of requirement or, as the case requires, the remaking of the decision: any other matter that is legally needed in order to complete anything commenced under this Act or any Order in Council made under this Act. For the purpose of giving effect to subclause (2), an Order in Council made under this Act may, despite its revocation, be amended after the date of its revocation as if it were still in force. An expert consenting panel continues in office after the repeal of this Act until it has completed the performance or exercise of its functions, duties, and powers and any matters related or ancillary to appeals, applications for judicial review, or rehearings in relation to the performance or exercise of its functions, duties, or powers. The panel convener continues in office after the repeal of this Act and has the power to perform and exercise all the functions, duties, and powers of the panel convener, including appointing new panels for any consent applications or notices of requirement, until the convener has completed the performance or exercise of the convener’s functions, duties, and powers, and any matters related or ancillary to appeals, applications for judicial review, or rehearings in relation to the performance or exercise of the convener’s functions, duties, or powers.  If, for any reason, the panel convener, a member of a panel, or other office holder ceases to hold office after the repeal of this Act but while the person still has functions, duties, or powers to perform or exercise under this Act, a person may be appointed to replace that person in accordance with this Act and despite its repeal. A certificate of compliance issued by a panel continues to have effect after the repeal of this Act. This clause applies to an activity that, in reliance on this Act, is carried out as a permitted activity in the course of work on infrastructure, but only if— a notice of intention covering the activity is given to the relevant local authority under clause 9 of Schedule 4 before the work commences and before the repeal of this Act; and the activity begins before the repeal of this Act. Despite the repeal of this Act, the activity may continue as a permitted activity (that is, an activity that does not require a resource consent) as if the Act had not been repealed. However, subclause (2) ceases to apply if— the effects of the activity cease to be the same or similar in character, intensity, and scale as they were before this Act was repealed; or the limited duration period (if any) expires. In subclause (3)﻿(b), limited duration period— means 15 years, unless the duration of a consent granted for the same activity under the Resource Management Act 1991 could be unlimited under section 123 of that Act; and must be calculated from the date on which a notice of intention for the activity is given to the relevant local authority under clause 9 of Schedule 4. For the avoidance of doubt, if the duration of a consent granted for the same activity under the Resource Management Act 1991 could be unlimited under section 123 of that Act, the activity is not subject to a limited duration period. If any costs can be recovered from an applicant or a requiring authority by the EPA or the Minister under this Act, those costs may continue to be recovered on or after the date on which this Act is repealed even if they relate to matters that occurred in relation to a referred project or a listed project on or after that date. This clause does not limit clause 1. The powers, functions, and duties conferred by this Act on the EPA may continue to be exercised or performed after the repeal of this Act, for any purpose connected with the recovery of costs, the provision of secretariat services or advice, and the completion of any other matter under this Act. The powers, functions, and duties conferred by this Act on local authorities and iwi authorities may continue to be exercised or performed after the repeal of this Act for any purpose connected with— the monitoring of activities authorised by or under this Act; and the fixing of charges; and the recovery of costs from the EPA; and the completion of any other matter under this Act. Clauses 1 to 5 do not limit the application of sections 17 to 21 of the Interpretation Act 1999.

The referral order must include the following: the name of each person that is— authorised to apply under this Act for a resource consent relating to the project; or authorised, if the person is a requiring authority, to lodge a notice of requirement for a designation or to alter a designation relating to the project: a description of the project and the activities it involves: the approximate geographical location of the project. The referral order must make any provision that is necessary to give effect to the Minister’s decisions under section 24. The referral order must include a statement of the Minister’s reasons for the decisions made under section 24. This schedule sets out the location requirements, permitted activities, and permitted activity standards that apply to the following agencies: KiwiRail Holdings Limited: the New Zealand Transport Agency. See section 29, which provides that,— if activities are carried out in the course of work on infrastructure that meets the criteria set out in section 30, and if the activities meet the criteria set out in section 31 and comply with the applicable permitted activity standards, the activities are permitted activities despite anything to the contrary in a plan or proposed plan; and the permitted activity standards do not override or replace any conditions that apply to an existing resource consent or designation. See section 34, which provides for an Order in Council to add other agencies to subclause (1) and make other changes to this schedule. In this schedule,— enforcement officer means any person authorised under section 38 of the Resource Management Act 1991 works means activities carried out in the course of work on infrastructure in reliance on this Act. Schedule 1AA of the Resource Management Act 1991 applies, and subpart 2 of Part 3 of the Legislation Act 2012 does not apply, to any material incorporated by reference into this schedule. This Part contains the permitted activity standards that apply to any agency carrying out work on infrastructure in reliance on this Act (see section 29). When planning works, an agency must engage with any of the following that have interests in the area within which the works are to be undertaken: iwi authorities about which the relevant local authority keeps records under section 35A of the Resource Management Act 1991; and any groups about which the relevant local authority keeps records under that section; and Treaty settlement entities whose area of interest overlaps, or is adjacent to, the area where the works will occur. The engagement must begin at least 30 working days before the works commence. The purpose of the engagement is to— determine interests and values held by iwi, hapū, and Treaty settlement entities in relation to the proposed works; and identify, for the purpose of section 32(3)﻿(b), any wāhi tapu that would exclude an activity in that place from being a permitted activity; and identify, as a site that requires a management plan, any other site— that is affected by or adjacent to the place where the works will occur; and that is a wāhi tapu, any other site of cultural or historical significance, or a habitat of taonga species. A wāhi tapu or other site of cultural significance need not be identified as such in the relevant plan or proposed plan and may, for example, be— recorded in the New Zealand Archaeological Association’s site recording scheme; or recorded in a list maintained under section 65 or 81 of the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014; or shown in the records of the Māori Land Court as a site set apart as a Maori reservation under Part 17 of Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. The agency must record the engagement undertaken and its outcomes, including— the interests and values identified; and the wāhi tapu and other sites identified under subclause (3)﻿(b) and (c); and the protocols or management plans agreed to in relation to those interests, values, and sites. An iwi authority, a hapū, or a Treaty settlement entity may recover from the agency the costs and expenses reasonably incurred in the course of identifying sites for the purpose of this clause. This clause applies if an agency complies with clause 5(1) and (2) in good faith, but gets no response from the authorities, groups, and entities it is required to engage with before the expiry of the period of 30 working days required under clause 5(2). The agency may proceed as if the process of engagement had resulted in nothing being determined or identified for the purpose of clause 5(3). This clause applies if any sites that require a management plan are identified during engagement with iwi authorities, groups, and Treaty settlement entities under clause 5. The agency must work with the authorities, groups, and entities to develop a management plan for the sites. The purpose of the management plan is to avoid, remedy, or mitigate the effects of the works on the sites. The management plan must include— processes for protecting the sites, which may include a process to provide for fish passage; and the appointment of a cultural monitor to oversee the works; and the approach to recording ongoing engagement; and management through use of buffer zones; and cultural protocols; and monitoring of these matters by the agency during the period of construction. Before it undertakes works, an agency must serve a notice of intention on— iwi authorities about which the relevant local authority keeps records under section 35A of the Resource Management Act 1991; and any groups about which the relevant local authority keeps records under that section; and Treaty settlement entities whose area of interest overlaps, or is adjacent to, the area where the works will occur. The notice must be served at least 10 working days before the works commence. The notice must include the following: a contact number and email address for the project lead: a brief description of the works: a copy of any management plan developed in accordance with clause 7: details of works that include fish passage: a statement of whether an authority is required to modify or destroy an archaeological site and, if so, whether the authority has been applied for or obtained (see sections 44, 56, and 62 of the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014): a copy of any accidental discovery protocol to be applied during any earthworks activities (see clause 13): an invitation to attend a pre-start or induction meeting. Before it undertakes works, an agency must serve a notice of intention on the relevant local authority. The notice must be served at least 10 working days before the works commence. The notice must include the following: a contact number and email address for the project lead: a brief description of the works: a record of engagement undertaken in accordance with clause 5: a copy of any management plan developed in accordance with clause 7: a copy of any other monitoring plan or management plan that this schedule states must be prepared before the works commence: an invitation to attend a pre-start or induction meeting. If the agency tries to engage with iwi authorities, groups, and Treaty settlement entities in accordance with clause 5 but receives no response from them, the notice must also include sufficient details to demonstrate that the agency took reasonable measures to contact those authorities, groups, and entities. This Part sets out, for KiwiRail Holdings Limited and the New Zealand Transport Agency,— location requirements for work on infrastructure; and the permitted activities; and the permitted activity standards, which apply in addition to the standards set out in Part 1 of this schedule. This clause sets out, for the purpose of section 30 (criteria for work on infrastructure), the location requirements for work on infrastructure that apply to KiwiRail Holdings Limited and the New Zealand Transport Agency. The infrastructure must be located in or on the national road corridor or the national rail corridor. The work may only be carried out on land that meets at least 1 of the following criteria: the agency has a legal interest in the land that authorises access to and use of the land for the works: the land is in or on the national road corridor or the national rail corridor, and the agency is authorised to access and use the land for the works: a compensation certificate under section 19 of the Public Works Act 1981 records the acquisition of the land for the works. Despite subclause (3), the work may occur within the bed of a river or within the coastal marine area, but only to the extent necessary for the work on infrastructure. In this clause,— national rail corridor means the existing network of railway lines, railway premises, and railway infrastructure, as those terms are defined in section 4(1) of the Railways Act 2005 national road corridor means the existing network of State highways, including the area under a bridge State highway has the meaning given in section 5(1) of the Land Transport Management Act 2003, except that it does not include a proposed State highway. Unless excluded by section 32, and subject to clause 11, any activity for the operation, maintenance, replacement, or minor upgrade of existing infrastructure is a permitted activity if the activity complies with the permitted activity standards in subpart 2. In this clause, minor upgrade means any of the following activities: the provision of a safety barrier: fencing and obstacle clearance: the safety upgrade of an intersection or a level crossing (including to add signals, a roundabout, a turning bay, or safety improvements for pedestrians or cyclists): the strengthening or replacement of a bridge, including abutments: a minor upgrade or replacement of a culvert: road widening for safety works: the upgrade or maintenance of a drainage network: the upgrade or maintenance of a footpath or shared-use path: the sealing of a road: the provision of a noise wall or barrier: the construction of a retaining structure in connection with any other minor upgrade. For any earthworks activity, an erosion and sediment control plan must be— prepared by a suitably qualified person with at least 5 years’ experience in erosion and sediment control; and served with the notice of intention to local authorities that is required by clause 9; and implemented in accordance with industry best practice that reflects the scale of the activity and associated earthworks. Industry best practice includes the measures and procedures specified within the Erosion and Sediment Control Guidelines for State Highway Infrastructure. The agency carrying out the work must— determine whether an authority is required to modify or destroy an archaeological site (see sections 44, 56, and 62 of the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014); and if no authority is required, prepare an accidental discovery protocol in advance of earthworks activity and apply the protocol if archaeological material is uncovered; and if an authority is required, obtain it. Sediment originating from the earthworks activity must, to the extent possible, be managed on site to ensure that it does not, after reasonable mixing, give rise to any of the following effects in the receiving waters: the production of conspicuous oil or grease films, scums, or foams, or floatable or suspended materials: a decrease of more than 20% in visual clarity: any emission of objectionable odour: making fresh water unsuitable for consumption by farm animals: more than minor adverse effects on aquatic life. All measures to minimise the generation and discharge of sediment from the earthworks activity must— be implemented, to the extent that is practicable, before the works commence; and include actions to minimise the area of open ground at any time and avoid, where practicable, any earthworks during winter months (June, July, and August); and remain in place until the earthworks activity has been completed and the area of earthworks has stabilised in accordance with the Erosion and Sediment Control Guidelines for State Highway Infrastructure. Earthworks must not— occur within 25 metres of any part of a natural wetland; or cause an adverse effect on any part of a natural wetland; or occur within 50 metres of a river in a statutory acknowledgement area without the consent of the relevant iwi authorities; or occur within 50 metres of identified īnanga spawning areas during īnanga spawning periods. In this clause, Erosion and Sediment Control Guidelines for State Highway Infrastructure means the document of that name as published by the New Zealand Transport Agency. The drilling of boreholes must comply with NZS 4411:2001 Environmental standard for drilling of soil and rock. Drilling must not occur at a location, or at a depth, or in a way that may affect any drinking-water supply. A bore/well log form must be submitted to the relevant unitary authority or regional council within 1 month of the bore being constructed. The bore must be decommissioned, in accordance with NZS 4411:2001 Environmental standard for drilling of soil and rock, as soon as practicable after the investigation and monitoring are completed. Groundwater discharge arising from dewatering and construction must not be from, into, or onto contaminated or potentially contaminated land that is identified under the Resource Management (National Environmental Standard for Assessing and Managing Contaminants in Soil to Protect Human Health) Regulations 2011. The discharge must not be from or into a natural wetland. The discharge must not cause, or increase any adverse effects from, flooding. Any structure in the coastal marine area must not cause a hazard to safe navigation. If the works include a temporary or permanent bridge or culvert, the activity must not disturb a river or lake bed to a depth or an extent greater than that required to undertake the activity. A temporary bridge must not remain in place for any longer than is necessary to undertake the works. All permanent structures must be designed, installed, and maintained to ensure there are no increased flooding effects. Subclause (6) applies if a construction activity results in any change, in size or extent, to the structure of any permanent bridge, abutment, or culvert. Records of the change and the associated flow calculations must be provided to the relevant unitary authority or regional council within 10 working days after the construction activity ends. All works that involve the temporary disturbance of a watercourse must be undertaken outside of relevant fish spawning periods, unless that precaution is deemed unnecessary or impracticable by a person with a post-graduate degree in freshwater ecology or a similar qualification. Proposals for works to ensure fish passage must be referred to all of the relevant bodies described in clause 5(1) at least 10 working days before the works commence, to enable feedback to be sought (see clause 5(3)). Fish passage and kōura passage must be provided at all times while works occur in watercourses, unless a temporary restriction of no more than 48 hours is required for construction or maintenance activities. Salvage and relocation of indigenous fish, kākahi/freshwater mussels, and kōura/freshwater crayfish must be undertaken for any stream diversions or dewatering and must be placed in the same waterway. In-stream structures must be designed and maintained to meet the minimum design standards for fish passage, as specified in the New Zealand Fish Passage Guidelines (NIWA Client Report No. 2018019HN, April 2018). The agency undertaking the works must take all appropriate measures to— prevent the spread of pest plants and unwanted organisms, including the organism that causes kauri dieback disease; and avoid the spread of pests in areas covered by a pest management plan that is developed by a unitary authority or regional council. Any new planting must be of non-invasive species. Revegetation must be of species naturally occurring within the ecological district and eco-sourced, unless— it is not possible to comply with that obligation; or there are sound ecological reasons to plant exotics. Plant species selected must take into account the habitat requirements of affected fauna. Vegetation must not be removed if it is identified in the relevant plan as significant indigenous vegetation, or as a significant habitat of indigenous fauna or a natural wetland. The maximum volume of earthworks within a significant natural area or significant ecological area, as identified in the relevant plan, must not exceed 40 cubic metres. Vegetation clearance activities must be completed in accordance with good arboricultural practice. Trees identified in a schedule to a relevant plan or proposed plan as having significant value must not be removed. Trimming and maintenance of a scheduled tree that is identified in the relevant plan may be undertaken only to enable the ongoing provision of existing infrastructure. In this clause, vegetation clearance means the disturbance, cutting, burning, clearing, damaging, destruction, or removal of vegetation. There must be an emergency spill prevention plan in place to prevent spills and to contain and manage any release of contaminants from equipment being used for the activity. The plan must be served with the notice of intention to local authorities that is required by clause 9. The provisions of the plan must be complied with at all times for the duration of the project. A copy of the plan must be held on site at all times and be made immediately available in response to any request from an enforcement officer. All construction equipment and materials must be removed on the completion of works. The following must not take place in, or within 10 metres of, any location where fuel can enter a water body: cleaning or refuelling of machinery or equipment: storage of fuel. The site investigation for the piece of land must—  be undertaken in accordance with Contaminated Land Management Guidelines No 5; and be reported on in accordance with Contaminated Land Management Guidelines No 1. A copy of the report of the site investigation must be provided to the relevant unitary authority or regional council within 2 months after the investigation is completed. For sites where soils are identified as containing contaminants above background levels, a site management plan must be— prepared and implemented by a suitably qualified practitioner with experience in the management of contaminated sites; and prepared in accordance with Contaminated Land Management Guidelines No 1; and either— served with the notice of intention to local authorities that is required by clause 9; or made available to the relevant territorial authority and unitary authority or regional council within 10 working days before the works commence. Soil taken away from the piece of land in the course of the activity must be disposed of at a facility authorised to receive soil of that kind. Records of the volume of soil and other materials deposited, and where they were deposited, must be maintained and made available on request to the relevant territorial authority and unitary authority or regional council within 10 working days of the date of the request. In this clause,— Contaminated Land Management Guidelines No 1 means the Contaminated Land Management Guidelines No. 1: Reporting on Contaminated Sites in New Zealand (Ministry for the Environment, reference ME 1071) Contaminated Land Management Guidelines No 5 means the Contaminated Land Management Guidelines No. 5: Site Investigation and Analysis of Soils (Ministry for the Environment, reference ME 1073). The discharge of dust must be managed in accordance with the Good Practice Guide for Assessing and Managing Dust (Ministry for the Environment, reference ME 1277), including minimising the discharge of dust to any site containing a sensitive activity. In this clause, sensitive activity means any of the following activities as they are defined in chapter J of the Auckland Unitary Plan Operative: an activity sensitive to aircraft noise: an activity sensitive to air discharges: an activity sensitive to hazardous facilities and infrastructure: an activity sensitive to noise: an activity sensitive to the National Grid. For works within 100 metres of a sensitive activity, a construction, noise, and vibration management plan must be prepared by a suitably qualified and experienced person and implemented before the start of the works. The purpose of the plan is to provide a framework for the development and implementation of methods to avoid, remedy, or mitigate adverse construction noise and vibration effects. The plan must be— prepared in accordance with NZS 6803:1999 Acoustics—Construction noise; and served with the notice of intention to local authorities that is required by clause 9. In this clause, sensitive activity— means residential, educational, community, health care, or visitor accommodation; and includes (without limitation)— dwellings: schools: marae: hotels and motels: residential care facilities. Signage may only be used if— it is required by any enactment; or it gives safety or security instructions or information; or it provides information or directions in relation to works. Any new permanent lighting must comply with AS/NZS 1158:2005 Lighting for roads and public spaces. Construction yards must be designed and located in a manner that will— minimise their visibility from occupied dwellings; and minimise risk of contaminant run-off to receiving water bodies. An emergency response plan for the use, storage, and handling of hazardous substances must be prepared and implemented in accordance with the Health and Safety at Work (Hazardous Substances) Regulations 2017. The plan must be served with the notice of intention to local authorities that is required by clause 9. The height of a noise attenuation wall or structure must not exceed 3 metres. For altered State highways, the New Zealand Transport Agency must assess and mitigate road-traffic noise in accordance with the Guide to assessing road-traffic noise using NZS 6806 for state highway asset improvement projects (as published by the New Zealand Transport Agency in August 2016). Within 12 months after completion of works, a post-construction review report must be— prepared in accordance with the Specification for Noise Mitigation (New Zealand Transport Agency, NZTA P40: 2014); and provided to the relevant territorial authority for its information. Management of stormwater from roads must be in accordance with NZTA P46 State Highway Stormwater Specification (New Zealand Transport Agency, NZTA P46: April 2016). Subclause (3) applies to any new impermeable road surface that— is greater than 1,000 square metres; and is, or originates from, a road with more than 5,000 vehicles per day at the date of construction. Stormwater quality treatment must be designed and maintained to remove from the surface at least 75% of the loads of total suspended solids on an average annual basis. This clause applies to the diversion and discharge of stormwater run-off from new impermeable surfaces within the road corridor or rail corridor. The diversion and discharge must not cause or increase scouring or erosion at the point of discharge or downstream. The diversion and discharge must not result in or increase the following: flooding of other properties in rainfall events up to the 10% annual exceedance probability; or  inundation of buildings on other properties in rainfall events up to the 1% annual exceedance probability.  The diversion and discharge must not cause or increase nuisance or damage to other properties or infrastructure. The diversion and discharge of stormwater run-off must not give rise to any of the following in any surface water or coastal water, after reasonable mixing: the production of conspicuous oil or grease films, scums, or foams, or floatable or suspended materials: a decrease of more than 20% in visual clarity: any emission of objectionable odour: making fresh water unsuitable for consumption by farm animals: more than minor adverse effects on aquatic life. Any adverse effects within the coastal marine area, including disturbance of the substrate and any deposit of material not permitted under clause 33, must be remedied or restored as soon as possible, preferably within 7 working days, but no later than 28 working days, after the completion of the works. Indigenous vegetation disturbance or clearance within the coastal marine area must not exceed a total of 100 square metres in area. Any change to the area occupied by an existing structure or reclamation or drainage system in the coastal marine area must be as small as practicable and must have no more than minor adverse effects on coastal processes. The area and volume of material dredged within the coastal marine area must be the minimum amount immediately necessary and sufficient for the works, taking into account future sedimentation rates. Dredging must not take place within 100 metres of a previously dredged site, unless at least 2 months has elapsed since the completion of previous dredging at that site. Impounded water must be released in a way that minimises potential contamination of receiving waters. Best-practice dredging methods must be used in order to minimise sediment re-mobilisation and dispersal. There must be no deepening or widening of the channel beyond the limits of its design profile. Dredging must not occur, during īnanga spawning periods, in any area described as an īnanga spawning area in a schedule to a plan or proposed plan. In significant wading bird areas identified in a unitary plan or regional plan, dredging— must be timed to avoid bird nesting seasons and minimise adverse effects on birds using roosting areas; and must not damage or disturb areas of salt marsh or seagrass, or nesting or roosting birds. Dredged material must not be deposited in the coastal marine area or on land where it could re-enter a water body, unless the deposit of that material is a permitted activity under a unitary plan or regional plan or has a resource consent. Removed mangrove vegetation must be disposed of outside the coastal marine area. The removal must be by hand and must not involve the use of vehicles on the foreshore. The removal may involve cutting a tree but must not involve removal of the entire tree. The removal must not involve any discharge of chemical herbicides in the coastal marine area, other than as provided for in an approved pest management plan prepared in accordance with the Biosecurity Act 1993. The removal must— be immediately adjacent to existing lawful structures, infrastructure, or drainage systems; and be solely to enable their operation, maintenance, replacement, or upgrade. The removal must not damage or disturb areas of salt marsh, seagrass, or other non-mangrove indigenous estuarine and wetland vegetation. The removal must not be in areas where mangroves are serving to mitigate coastal erosion from wave action. Any removal in a significant wading bird area, as identified in a unitary plan or regional plan, must be timed to avoid bird nesting seasons and minimise adverse effects on birds using roosting areas. The agency undertaking the works must keep evidence of compliance with the relevant standards applied by this schedule on the completion of the works. The relevant consent authority may request a copy of all or part of the evidence. The agency must comply with the request within 10 working days after the date on which they receive it. The purpose of an expert consenting panel appointed under this schedule is to ensure that decisions are made on— 1 or more consent applications for a listed project or a referred project; and 1 or more notices of requirement for designations or to alter a designation for a listed project or a referred project. A panel must determine consent applications and notices of requirement in accordance with the provisions of this Act. A panel may issue certificates of compliance in relation to a listed project or a referred project. The Minister must appoint a current or former (including retired) Environment Judge to be the panel convener for the purposes of this Act for a term determined by the Minister. The Minister may at any time remove the panel convener for just cause (within the meaning of clause 9(3)), and clause 9(2) applies with any necessary modifications. The panel convener may resign their office at any time by notice in writing to the Minister. The panel convener, unless they earlier resign or are removed from office under subclause (2), continues in office until their successor is appointed by the Minister. The function of the panel convener is to appoint the members of panels (for a term of office set by the panel convener)— to determine consent applications or notices of requirement for a listed project or a referred project; and to issue certificates of compliance for a listed project or a referred project in accordance with clause 27 of Schedule 6. Up to 4 persons may be appointed to be members of a panel set up to determine— applications for resource consents for listed projects or referred projects; and requirements for designations or alterations of designations for listed projects or referred projects. The membership of a panel must include— 1 person nominated by the relevant local authorities; and 1 person nominated by the relevant iwi authorities. The person nominated by a local authority may, but need not, be an elected member of the local authority. If either the relevant local authorities or the relevant iwi authorities nominate more than 1 person for appointment as a panel member, the panel convener must decide which one of those nominees is to be appointed as a panel member. If a local authority or an iwi authority does not make a nomination under subclause (2), the panel convener must appoint a person with the appropriate skills and experience to be a member of the panel (see clause 7(1)). Despite the limit specified on the membership by subclause (1), that number may be exceeded (including by the appointment of more than 1 person nominated under subclause (2)﻿(a) or subclause (2)﻿(b)), at the discretion of the panel convener, if warranted by, or required to accommodate,— the circumstances unique to a particular district or region; or the number of applications that have to be considered in that particular district or region; or the nature and scale of the application under consideration; or matters unique to any relevant Treaty settlement Act; or the collective knowledge and experience needed under clause 7(1). This clause is subject to clause 7 (which imposes requirements regarding the qualifications of individual panel members and the collective knowledge and experience of the panel). The panel convener must appoint a Judge or retired Judge, as one of the members appointed under clause 3, to be the chairperson of a panel. However, if the panel convener is a Judge or retired Judge, the panel convener may act as the chairperson of a panel, instead of appointing another person as chairperson of the panel. Despite subclauses (1) and (2), the panel convener may, if the circumstances require it, appoint a suitably qualified lawyer with experience in resource management law to be the chairperson of a panel. In the event of an equality of votes, the chairperson of the panel has a casting vote. A panel has a quorum of 3 members. This section applies if any Treaty settlement Act, iwi participation legislation (within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Resource Management Act 1991), Mana Whakahono a Rohe, or joint management agreement includes procedural arrangements relating to the appointment of a decision-making body for hearings and other procedural matters, such as the following: a requirement for iwi or hapū to participate in the appointment of hearing commissioners to determine resource consent applications or notice of requirement lodged under the Resource Management Act 1991: a requirement that notice be given to any person or specified class of person of any steps in a resource management process: any consultation requirements with iwi or hapū: any other matter of procedure for determining resource consent applications or notices of requirement lodged under the Resource Management Act 1991. The panel convener or panel must either— comply with the arrangements in the Treaty settlement Act, iwi participation legislation, or agreements referred to in subclause (1) as if they were a local authority; or obtain the agreement of the relevant Treaty settlement entity or iwi authority to adopt a modified arrangement that is consistent with achieving the purpose of this Act, the Treaty settlement Act, iwi participation legislation, and any agreements referred to in subclause (1). The relevant Treaty settlement entity or iwi authority may not unreasonably withhold their agreement to a modified arrangement (as described in subclause (2)﻿(b)). If the panel convener or panel are unable to obtain agreement under subclause (2)﻿(b) (in circumstances where that agreement is not unreasonably withheld) they must stop processing the application and must return the application to the applicant immediately. The panel convener may, at any time, appoint a new member to replace a member removed under clause 9 or who resigns or dies. The members of a panel must, collectively, have— the knowledge, skills, and expertise relevant to resource management issues; and the technical expertise relevant to the project; and expertise in tikanga Māori and mātauranga Māori. Unless subclause (3) applies, a person must, in order to be eligible for appointment as a panel member, be accredited under section 39A of the Resource Management Act 1991. Despite subclause (2), the panel convener may at their discretion appoint as a panel member a person who is not accredited under section 39A of the Resource Management Act 1991 as a panel member if the person satisfies the requirements of subclause (1)﻿(a), (b), or (c). A person is not ineligible for appointment as a panel member by reason only that the person is a member of a particular iwi or hapū (including an iwi or hapū that is represented by an iwi authority that must be invited by the panel to comment on the application). The panel convener and members of the panel are entitled— to receive remuneration not within paragraph (b) for services as the panel convener or a member at a rate and of a kind determined by the Minister in accordance with the fees framework; and in accordance with the fees framework, to be reimbursed for actual and reasonable travelling and other expenses incurred in carrying out their office as the panel convener or as a panel member as if the convener and members were members of a statutory board for the purposes of the Fees and Travelling Allowances Act 1951. For the purposes of subclause (1), fees framework means the framework determined by the Government from time to time for the classification and remuneration of statutory and other bodies in which the Crown has an interest. The panel convener may remove any person appointed to a panel under this schedule for just cause. The person may be removed with as little formality and technicality, and as much expedition, as is permitted by— the principles of natural justice; and a proper consideration of the matter. In this section, just cause includes misconduct, inability to perform the functions of office, neglect of duty, and breach of duty (depending on the seriousness of the breach). A member of the panel may resign at any time as a member by notice in writing to the panel convener. A panel must regulate its own procedure as it thinks appropriate, without procedural formality, and in a manner that best promotes the just and timely determination of an application. Subclause (1) applies subject to any other provision in this Act relevant to the procedures of a panel. A panel may appoint a special adviser to assist the panel with an application in relation to any matters the panel may determine. A panel may, at any time, appoint technical advisers, including from a department of State, Crown entity, or relevant local authority, as it thinks appropriate. A panel may use or allow any remote access facility that will assist in the determination of an application. A panel must keep a full record of its proceedings. The EPA must provide advice and secretariat support— to the panel convener to convene panels, appoint the chairperson and members of a panel, and carry out the other functions of the convener under this Act; and to a panel in its role of determining any matters before it under this Act. A relevant local authority must assist the panel by providing advice within the knowledge of the authority, if requested by the panel. The panel convener and members appointed to a panel are not liable for anything that the panel convener or a member does or omits to do in good faith in performing or exercising the functions, duties, or powers of the panel. The EPA may recover from a person the actual and reasonable costs incurred by the EPA in providing assistance to the person prior to a consent application or notice of requirement or an application for a certificate of compliance being lodged with the EPA (whether or not the requirement is subsequently lodged). The EPA may recover from a consent applicant or requiring authority the actual and reasonable costs incurred by the EPA or a panel in exercising its functions and powers under this schedule and Schedule 6, including— the costs in respect of support and advice provided to a panel by the EPA; and the costs incurred in gathering information from a local authority (see clause 7 of Schedule 6); and  the costs charged by a local authority in giving advice (see clause 11(2)). The EPA must, on request by a consent applicant or requiring authority, provide an estimate of the costs likely to be recoverable under this clause. The EPA must, when recovering costs under this clause, have regard to the following criteria: the sole purpose is to recover the reasonable costs incurred in respect of the matter to which the costs relate: a consent applicant or requiring authority should be required to pay for costs only to the extent that the benefit of the actions of the EPA and the panel to which the costs relate is obtained by the applicant or requiring authority, as distinct from the community as a whole: the extent to which an activity undertaken by a consent applicant or requiring authority reduces the cost to the EPA of performing and exercising its functions, duties, and powers. A person may object under section 357B of the Resource Management Act 1991 to a requirement to pay costs under any of subclauses (1) to (3), and that Act applies accordingly and with any necessary modifications. Section 149ZF of the Resource Management Act 1991 also applies, with any necessary modifications, to the recovery of costs under this Act. The Minister may recover from a consent applicant or requiring authority the actual and reasonable costs incurred in relation to a panel in performing or exercising its functions, powers, and duties under this Act. The Minister must, on request by a consent applicant or requiring authority, provide an estimate of the costs likely to be recoverable under this clause. A local authority that provides assistance on request under clause 11(2) may recover from the EPA the actual and reasonable costs incurred in providing that assistance.  The criteria set out in clause 13(4) apply to the Minister and to a local authority in recovering costs under this clause.  The Minister may, in writing, delegate to the EPA the Minister’s functions, powers, and duties under clause 14. A delegation under this clause— is revocable at will, but the revocation does not take effect until it is communicated in writing to the EPA; and does not prevent the Minister from performing or exercising the functions, duties, or powers concerned. Part 1 and sections 48 and 53 of the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 apply, with any necessary modifications, as if a panel were a board of inquiry given authority to conduct a hearing under section 149J of the Resource Management Act 1991. This schedule sets out— the requirements to be met when lodging the following for a listed project or a referred project: a consent application: a notice of requirement for a designation or to alter a designation; and the requirements a panel must comply with when determining a consent application or notice of requirement; and the appeal rights relating to a panel’s decisions on consent applications and notices of requirement.  A person authorised in accordance with section 15 may, in respect of a listed project or a referred project, apply for a resource consent that would otherwise be applied for under section 88 of the Resource Management Act 1991. A requiring authority authorised in accordance with section 15 may, in respect of a listed project or a referred project, lodge— a notice of requirement for a designation: a notice of requirement to alter a designation. A consent application or a notice of requirement must—  be lodged with the EPA; and be made in the approved form and manner; and comply with any restrictions or obligations, such as any information requirements included in—  Schedule 2, in the case of a listed project: Schedule 3 and the referral order, in the case of a referred project. Consent applications must not be lodged with the EPA nor determined by a panel if they relate to an activity that— is classified as a prohibited activity— in a relevant plan or proposed plan; or in regulations made under the Resource Management Act 1991 (including any national environmental standard); and is to occur within a customary marine title area, unless agreed in writing with the appropriate customary marine title group. The EPA must approve an application form for the purposes of this clause and ensure that it is made available on an Internet site maintained by the EPA. The provisions of this schedule apply to a notice of requirement to alter a designation as if it were a notice of requirement for a new designation.  Within 5 working days of receiving a consent application or notice of requirement, the EPA must determine whether the application or notice— relates solely to 1 or more of the listed projects or referred projects; and does not breach clause 2(3)﻿(c) or (4); and contains all the information required under clauses 9 to 13. If the EPA is satisfied that a consent application or notice of requirement complies with the matters listed in subclause (1), the EPA must provide the application or notice to the panel appointed to determine that application or notice. If the EPA determines that a consent application or notice of requirement does not comply with the requirements of clause 3(1), it must return the application or notice immediately to the person who lodged it, with written reasons for the EPA’s determination. If a consent application or notice of requirement is lodged again with the EPA after the EPA has returned the application or notice to the person who lodged it,— that application or notice must be treated as a new application or notice; and  the time period specified in clause 3(1) begins again for the EPA. At any time before a determination is given on a consent application or notice of requirement lodged under clause 2, the consent applicant or requiring authority may withdraw that application or notice by giving written notice— to the EPA; and in relation to a consent application for a coastal permit to undertake an aquaculture activity, to the Director-General of the Ministry for Primary Industries; and if the withdrawal occurs after persons or groups have been invited to provide written comments under clause 17(2), to those persons or groups. As soon as practicable after receiving a notice under subclause (1)﻿(a), the EPA must advise the panel that the relevant consent application or notice of requirement has been withdrawn. Processing of a consent application or notice of requirement lodged with the EPA may be suspended in the following circumstances: by the EPA under subclause (2) (for non-payment of costs recoverable by the EPA): by the panel— under clause 22 (Minister may direct delay): under clause 23 (request for suspension of processing by consent applicant or requiring authority). If a consent applicant or requiring authority has not paid the costs recoverable by the EPA, the EPA may suspend the processing of the consent application or notice of requirement and must give notice of the suspension— to the applicant or requiring authority; and if the suspension occurs after persons or groups have been invited to provide comments under clause 17(2), to those persons or groups. If the applicant or requiring authority subsequently pays the costs recoverable by the EPA, the EPA must resume processing the consent application or notice of requirement and must give notice of the resumption to the persons notified of the suspension. This clause applies if the EPA considers that information held by a local authority in respect of a listed project or a referred project is necessary and relevant to a current or an anticipated consent application or notice of requirement. The EPA, at any time before or after it receives a consent application or notice of requirement under clause 2, may request the relevant local authority to provide the information and set a date by which the information must be made available. The local authority concerned must,— within the time specified by the EPA, provide the information requested; or advise the EPA that the information will be available, but not within the time specified by the EPA; or advise the EPA that the local authority does not hold the information and, if the local authority knows where the information is held, advise the EPA accordingly. If a local authority is unable to provide the information requested under subclause (2) within the time specified under subclause (3)﻿(a), the local authority must provide the information as soon as practicable. The local authority is entitled to set, and recover from the EPA, a reasonable charge for the supply of information requested by the EPA under this clause. The EPA may make administrative decisions that are incidental or ancillary to the conduct of the panel. The EPA must publish, free of charge to the public on an Internet site it maintains, every written notice or other document that this Act requires to be— received by the EPA or a panel from any person; or sent by the EPA or a panel to any person. In performing and exercising its functions, duties, and powers under this schedule, the EPA must, as far as is reasonably practicable, minimise costs and avoid delay. Every consent application for a listed or a referred project made under clause 2 must include the following information: a description of the proposed activity; and a description and map of the site at which the activity is to occur; and confirmation that the consent application complies with clause 3(1); and the full name and address of— each owner of the site and of land adjacent to the site; and  each occupier of the site and of land adjacent to the site who, after reasonable inquiry, is able to be identified by the consent applicant; and a description of any other activities that are part of the proposal to which the consent application relates; and a description of any other resource consents, notices of requirement for designations, or alterations to designations required for the proposal to which the consent application relates; and an assessment of the activity against— Part 2 of the Resource Management Act 1991; and the purpose of this Act; and the matters set out in section 19 (whether project helps to achieve purpose of Act); and an assessment of the activity against any relevant provisions in any of the documents listed in subclause (2); and information about any Treaty settlements that apply in the project area, including— the identification of the relevant provisions in those Treaty settlements; and a summary of any redress provided by those settlements that affects natural and physical resources relevant to the project or project area; and the conditions that the applicant proposes for the resource consent. The documents referred to in subclause (1)﻿(h) are the following: a national environmental standard: other regulations made under the Resource Management Act 1991: a national policy statement: a New Zealand coastal policy statement: a regional policy statement or proposed regional policy statement: a plan or proposed plan: a planning document recognised by a relevant iwi authority and lodged with a local authority. An assessment under subclause (1)﻿(h) must include an assessment of the activity against— any relevant objectives, policies, or rules in a document listed in subclause (2); and any requirement, condition, or permission in any rules in any of those documents; and any other requirements in any of those documents. A consent application must include an assessment of the activity’s effects on the environment that— includes the information required by clause 10; and covers the matters specified in clause 11. A consent application must also include— a cultural impact assessment prepared by or on behalf of the relevant iwi authority; or if a cultural impact assessment is not provided, a statement of any reasons given by the relevant iwi authority for not providing that assessment. A consent application must also include the following information: if a permitted activity is part of the proposal to which the consent application relates, a description that demonstrates that the activity complies with the requirements, conditions, and permissions for the permitted activity (so that a resource consent is not required for that activity under section 87A(1) of the Resource Management Act 1991); and if the activity is to occur in an area that is within the scope of a planning document prepared by a customary marine title group under section 85 of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011, an assessment of the activity against any resource management matters set out in that planning document (for the purposes of clause 30(3)); and in the case of a referred project, all the additional information required by the relevant referral order. An assessment of an activity’s effects on the environment under clause 9(4) must include the following information: an assessment of the actual or potential effects on the environment: if the activity includes the use of hazardous installations, an assessment of any risks to the environment that are likely to arise from such use: if the activity includes the discharge of any contaminant, a description of— the nature of the discharge and the sensitivity of the receiving environment to adverse effects; and any possible alternative methods of discharge, including discharge into any other receiving environment: a description of the mitigation measures (including safeguards and contingency plans where relevant) to be undertaken to help prevent or reduce the actual or potential effect of the activity: identification of persons who may be affected by the activity and any response to the views of any persons consulted, including the views of iwi or hapū that have been consulted in relation to the proposal: if iwi or hapū elect not to respond when consulted on the proposal, any reasons that they have specified for that decision: if the scale and significance of the activity’s effects are such that monitoring is required, a description of how the effects will be monitored and by whom, if the activity is approved: an assessment of any effects of the activity on the exercise of a protected customary right. Subclause (1)﻿(e) does not oblige a consent applicant to consult any person, although a failure by the applicant to consult, or to consult adequately, may be taken into account by a panel in determining a consent application. A consent application need not include any additional information specified in a relevant policy statement or plan that would be required in an assessment of environmental effects under clause 6(2) or 7(2) of Schedule 4 of the Resource Management Act 1991. The assessment of an activity’s effects on the environment under clause 9(4) must cover the following matters: any effect on the people in the neighbourhood and, if relevant, the wider community, including any social, economic, or cultural effects: any physical effect on the locality, including landscape and visual effects: any effect on ecosystems, including effects on plants or animals and physical disturbance of habitats in the vicinity: any effect on natural and physical resources having aesthetic, recreational, scientific, historical, spiritual, or cultural value, or other special value, for present or future generations: any discharge of contaminants into the environment and options for the treatment and disposal of contaminants: the unreasonable emission of noise: any risk to the neighbourhood, the wider community, or the environment through natural hazards or hazardous installations. In addition to the information required in a consent application under clause 9, a consent application for a subdivision in a project area must include information that adequately defines the following: the position of all new boundaries; and the areas of all new allotments, unless the subdivision involves a cross lease, company lease, or unit plan; and the locations and areas of new reserves to be created, including any esplanade reserves and esplanade strips; and the locations and areas of existing esplanade reserves, esplanade strips, and access strips; and the locations and areas of any part of the bed of a river or lake to be vested in a territorial authority under section 237A of the Resource Management Act 1991; and the locations and areas of any land within the coastal marine area that is to become part of the common marine and coastal area under section 237A of the Resource Management Act 1991; and the locations and areas of land to be set aside as new roads. A consent application for a reclamation must include, in addition to the information required for a consent application by clause 9, information to show the area to be reclaimed, including the following: the location of the area to be reclaimed: if practicable, the position of all new boundaries: any part of the reclaimed area to be set aside as an esplanade reserve or esplanade strip. A notice of requirement for a listed project or in a referred project must include the following information:  a description of the site to which the notice of requirement applies; and information on the effects of the proposed project or work on the environment, together with a description of how any adverse effects will be mitigated; and confirmation that the notice of requirement complies with clause 3(1); and an assessment of the project or work against— Part 2 of the Resource Management Act 1991 and the purpose of this Act; and any relevant provisions in any of the documents listed in subclause (4); and information about any Treaty settlements that apply in the project area, including— the identification of the relevant provisions in those Treaty settlements; and a summary of any redress provided by those settlements that affects natural and physical resources relevant to the project or project area; and the full name and address of — each owner of the land to which the notice of requirement relates and of the land adjacent to that land; and each person who, after reasonable inquiry, is known by the requiring authority to be an occupier of the land to which the notice relates and of the land adjacent to that land; and  an assessment of whether the project or work and the designation sought are reasonably necessary for achieving the objectives of the requiring authority; and any consideration of alternative sites, routes, or methods of undertaking the project or work; and a list of the resource consents needed for the project or work and whether these have been applied for; and a description of any consultation undertaken with parties likely to be affected by the project or work and the designation; and a cultural impact assessment prepared by or on behalf of the relevant iwi authority; and if a cultural assessment is not provided, a statement of the reasons (if any) given by the relevant iwi authority as to why an assessment is not being provided; and any conditions that the requiring authority proposes for the designation.  In the case of a referred project, a notice of requirement must also include all the additional information required by the relevant referral order. The information required by this clause must be provided in sufficient detail to correspond to the scale and significance of the effects that the activity may have on the environment, taking into account any proposal by the requiring authority to manage the adverse effects of the activity through conditions, including conditions requiring the preparation of a management plan. The documents referred to in subclause (1)﻿(d)﻿(ii) are the following: a national policy statement: a New Zealand coastal policy statement: a regional policy statement or proposed regional policy statement: a plan or proposed plan: a planning document recognised by a relevant iwi authority and lodged with a local authority. The information required by clauses 9 to 13 must be provided in sufficient detail to correspond to the scale and significance of the effects that the activity is anticipated to have on the environment. Subclause (1) applies, taking into account any proposal by a consent applicant or requiring authority to manage the adverse effects of an activity through conditions, including conditions requiring the preparation of a management plan. If a consent application is made under this schedule for a coastal permit to undertake an aquaculture activity, or includes such an application, a copy of the application must be included for the Director-General of the Ministry for Primary Industries. If a consent application is made to subdivide land that, in whole or in part, is in the coastal marine area, a panel must decide the application as if the whole of the land to be subdivided were part of the abutting district. Subclause (3) applies if a consent application is made for an activity that the applicant intends to undertake once the proposed location of the activity has been reclaimed, but on the date on which the application is lodged, the proposed location of the new activity is still within the coastal marine area.  The panel may decide the application as if— the application related to an activity within the abutting district; and the district plan applying in the abutting district applied to the proposed location of the activity. A panel must not give public or limited notification of a consent application or notice of requirement. However, not later than 5 working days after the EPA has determined that the application meets the requirements of clause 3 and has referred the consent application or notice of requirement to a panel under that clause, the panel must invite written comments on the application or notice of requirement before it from the persons or groups listed in subclauses (4) to (8). The requirements for a notice given under this clause are in clause 18. For a listed project, a panel must invite comments on a consent application or notice of requirement before it from the following: the relevant local authorities; and the relevant iwi authorities; and a Treaty settlement entity relevant to the listed project, including an entity that has an interest under a Treaty settlement in an area where a listed project is to occur; and if a consent application relates to an activity in a customary marine title area, the relevant customary marine title group; and if a consent application relates to an activity in a protected customary rights area, the relevant protected customary rights group; and the owners of the land on which the project is to be undertaken and the land adjacent to that land; and the occupiers of the land on which the project is to be undertaken and the land adjacent to that land unless, after reasonable inquiry, an occupier cannot be identified; and Ministers of the Crown responsible for the following portfolios: Arts, Culture, and Heritage; and Climate Change; and Conservation; and Defence; and Education; and Housing; and Infrastructure; and Land Information; and Local Government; and Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti; and Transport; and Treaty of Waitangi negotiations; and Urban Development; and the Director-General of Conservation; and each of the organisations listed in subclause (6)﻿(k) to (u); and any requiring authority that has a designation on land on which the project is to be undertaken, or on land that is adjacent to the land on which the project is to be undertaken. A panel may invite written comments from any other person the panel considers appropriate. For a referred project, a panel must invite comments on a consent application or notice of requirement before it from the following: the relevant local authorities; and the relevant iwi authorities, including those identified in the report obtained under section 17(1); and  a Treaty settlement entity relevant to the referred project, including— an entity that has an interest under a Treaty settlement in an area where a referred project is to occur; and an entity identified in the report obtained under section 17(1); and if a consent application relates to an activity in a customary marine title area, the relevant customary marine title group (including any relevant customary marine title group identified in the report obtained under section 17(1)); and if a consent application relates to an activity in a protected customary rights area, the relevant protected customary rights group (including any relevant protected customary rights group identified in the report obtained under section 17(1)); and  any applicant group under the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 identified in the report obtained under section 17(1); and the owners of the land on which the project is to be undertaken and the land adjacent to that land; and the occupiers of the land on which the project is to be undertaken and the land adjacent to that land unless, after reasonable inquiry, an occupier cannot be identified; and Ministers of the Crown responsible for the portfolios listed in subclause (4)﻿(h); and the Director-General of Conservation; and Business New Zealand Incorporated; and Employers’ and Manufacturers’ Association (Northern) Incorporated; and Environmental Defence Society Incorporated; and Generation Zero Incorporated; and Greenpeace of New Zealand Incorporated; and Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga; and Infrastructure New Zealand Incorporated; and the New Zealand Fish and Game Council; and the New Zealand Infrastructure Commission/Te Waihanga; and Property Council of New Zealand Incorporated; and Royal Forest & Bird Protection Society of New Zealand Incorporated; and any requiring authority that has a designation on land on which the project is to be undertaken, or on land that is adjacent to that land.  A panel must also invite comments on a referred project from any person listed in a referral order (see section 24(2)﻿(e)). A panel may invite comments from any other person the panel considers appropriate. If a panel has not been appointed by the date provided for under subclause (2), the panel convener must, without undue delay, appoint a panel which must, without undue delay, comply with the requirements of that clause. A panel must specify in its invitation that written comments on a consent application or notice of requirement must be received by the EPA on behalf of the panel on a specified date (which must be 10 working days after the date on which the invitation is given under clause 17(2)). The invitation must include notice of the consent application or notice of requirement, with details as to how to access the consent application or notice of requirement.  An iwi authority invited to provide comments under clause 17(2) may— share the consent application or notice of requirement with hapū whose rohe is in the project area proposed in the application or notice; and choose to include comments from that hapū with the comments provided to the panel by the iwi authority. Written comments may be returned to the EPA by electronic means. The EPA must forward copies of any comments received under this clause to the consent applicant or requiring authority. The panel is not required to consider any comments received after the time specified in the invitation, but may do so, in its discretion, as long as the panel has not issued its decision. There is no right for any person to seek a waiver of the time limit for written comments to be received by the EPA. The consent applicant or requiring authority, if it makes a response to comments provided under clause 18 on a consent application or notice of requirement, must provide that response to the EPA not later than 5 working days after the date by which those comments provided under clause 18 had to be received by the EPA in accordance with that clause. There is no requirement for a panel to hold a hearing in respect of a consent application or notice of requirement and no person has a right to be heard by a panel.  If, in its discretion, a panel considers it is appropriate to hold a hearing, it may hear from— the applicant; and any person commissioned by the panel to write a report on the relevant consent application or notice of requirement; and any person or group that provided comments in response to an invitation given under clause 17(2). If a person or group that provided comments is heard, a panel must give the consent applicant or requiring authority the opportunity to be heard.  If a panel decides to hold a hearing, the EPA, at the direction of the panel, must issue a notice of hearing to persons or groups referred to in subclause (1), fixing the date, time, and place of the hearing. The notice must give no less than 5 working days’ notice of the hearing, and must advise the persons notified— that they may appear and be heard, be represented, and call evidence in relation to the consent application or notice of requirement; and that they must, within 3 working days after the notice of hearing is given, advise the EPA whether they will attend the hearing. If a person or group advises a panel under subclause (4)﻿(b) that they will attend a hearing but fails to appear, the panel may proceed with the hearing. A panel must complete any hearing within the time frame allowed under clause 37(2) for the panel to issue its final decision. If a hearing is held, a panel must— avoid unnecessary formality; and recognise tikanga Māori where appropriate; and receive evidence, written or spoken, in Māori (and Te Ture mō Te Reo Māori 2016/the Māori Language Act 2016 applies accordingly); and not permit any person other than the chairperson or members of a panel to question a party or witness; but if the chairperson of a panel gives leave, permit cross-examination. Section 4 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act 1908 (which gives powers to maintain order) applies to any hearing conducted by a panel under this Act. A panel may receive as evidence any statement, document, information, or matter that in its opinion may assist it to deal effectively with a consent application or notice of requirement, whether or not it would be admissible in a court of law. A panel may, in its discretion, make an order that prohibits or restricts the publication or other means of communication of information supplied to the panel or obtained by it in the course of a hearing. Subclause (10) applies whether or not the information is material to determining a consent application or notice of requirement if there would be good reason to withhold the information under section 6 or 7 of the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. A panel may, if it considers that there is likely to be excessive repetition, limit the circumstances in which persons with the same interests may speak or call evidence. A panel may direct that a hearing or part of a hearing be held using 1 or more remote access facilities— on the initiative of the panel; or at the request of the applicant or requiring authority; or at the request of a person or a representative of a group of persons referred to in subclause (1). If a hearing is held using a remote access facility, a panel must,— if it is reasonably practicable to do so, enable access to the hearing by making it available live and free of charge to the public, for example, on an Internet site; or as soon as practicable after the hearing closes, make available, free of charge on an Internet site,— an audio or a video recording of the hearing; or a written transcript of the hearing. Subclause (14) is subject to section 48 of the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 (right of local authorities to exclude public). The Minister may, at any time after a consent application or notice of requirement has been provided to a panel, give a written direction, with reasons, to the EPA that the panel must suspend processing, or further processing, of the application or notice. If the EPA receives a direction from the Minister under subclause (1), the EPA must, within 5 working days of receiving the direction, give written notice of it, and the Minister’s reasons, to— the members of the panel; and the relevant local authorities; and the applicant or requiring authority; and any person or group invited to provide comments under clause 17(2). The Minister may exercise the discretion under subclause (1) if the Minister considers that— resource consents, or further resource consents, are required in respect of the proposal to which the consent application or notice of requirement relates; and the nature of the proposal will be better understood if a consent application is made for those resource consents before the panel proceeds further. The Minister may, at any time, by notice in writing with reasons, withdraw the direction given to the EPA under subclause (1). A copy of the Minister’s direction given under subclause (1) must be given to the persons and groups listed in subclause (2). Subclause (7) applies if the Minister’s direction given under subclause (1) is withdrawn under subclause (4) before any consent applications for further resource consents are lodged. If this subclause applies, the panel must resume processing the original consent application or notice of requirement from the date on which the Minister’s direction is withdrawn. Subclause (9) applies if consent applications for further resource consents are lodged with the EPA before the Minister’s direction given under subclause (1) is withdrawn. If this subclause applies, the panel must — resume processing the original consent application or notice of requirement; and observe the time frames set out in this schedule that apply to the further consent applications, instead of the time frames that would have applied to the original consent application or notice of requirement. A consent applicant or a requiring authority may make a written request to the EPA that a panel suspend processing a consent application or notice of requirement.  A request may be made only in the period between— the time when the EPA provides the consent application or notice of requirement to a panel under clause 3; and the time when a panel issues its final decision on an application or notice under clause 37. The EPA must provide a copy of the request received under subclause (1)— to the relevant local authority; and to any person or group invited to provide comments under clause 17(2). A panel, at its discretion,— may suspend the processing of a consent application or notice of requirement when a request is made under subclause (1); but if it does grant a suspension, must give the consent applicant or requiring authority written advice of the date on and after which the panel ceased to process the application or notice. Despite subclause (4), a panel must grant a request to suspend the processing of a consent application that relates to an aquaculture activity, if the consent applicant advises that the suspension is necessary for the purpose of negotiating a pre-request aquaculture agreement under section 186ZM of the Fisheries Act 1996. A consent applicant or requiring authority granted a suspension under subclause (4) or (5) may request in writing that the processing of the application or notice be resumed.  If a panel receives a request under subclause (6), it must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, resume processing the consent application or notice of requirement. If a panel does not receive a request under subclause (6), it may decide under clause 24(2)﻿(b) to continue to process the consent application or notice of requirement.  If processing of a consent application or notice of requirement is resumed or continued under subclause (7) or (8), the EPA must give written notice of that, specifying the date on which processing was resumed or continued,— to the consent applicant or requiring authority; and  to the relevant local authority; and to any person or group invited to provide comments under clause 17(2). This clause applies if 50 working days have elapsed since the processing of a consent application or notice of requirement was suspended under clause 23(4)﻿(a) or (5). A panel must decide whether— to return the consent application or notice of requirement to the applicant or requiring authority; or to continue to process the application or notice. The decision of a panel under this clause must be notified in writing to— the applicant or requiring authority; and the relevant local authority; and in relation to a consent application for a coastal permit to undertake an aquaculture activity, the Director-General of the Ministry for Primary Industries; and any person or group invited to provide comments under clause 17(2). If a panel decides to return the consent application or notice of requirement, it must be returned together with written reasons for its return. If a consent application or notice of requirement that has been returned is lodged again with the EPA, the application or notice must be treated as a new application or notice. If a consent application or notice of requirement is suspended more than once, the total number of days over which processing may be suspended must not be more than 50 working days. At any time before a panel issues its final decision on a consent application or notice of requirement under clause 37, the panel may direct the EPA— to request further information on a proposal from any of the following: a consent applicant or requiring authority: a relevant local authority: any person or group invited to provide comments under clause 17(2): to prepare or commission a report (including a report from a relevant local authority) on an issue relevant to the consent application or notice of requirement. If further information is requested under subclause (1)﻿(a), the person or body requesting the information must— provide electronic copies of the information or report requested; or advise the EPA, with reasons, that it declines to provide the information or report requested. Subclause (2) must be complied with by the date directed by the panel, which must not be later than 10 working days after the direction is given. As soon as is reasonably practicable after the date on which any information or report is received by the EPA from any person or body requested or commissioned under subclause (1)﻿(a) or (b), the EPA must provide electronic copies of the information or report— to the members of the panel; and to the consent applicant or requiring authority; and to every person or group that provided comments under clause 17(2). The persons and groups that receive the information or report under subclause (4)﻿(c) may not make further comments unless requested by the panel.  If information requested under subclause (1) is not received by the panel in accordance with subclauses (2) and (3), the panel must proceed as if the request for further information had been declined. Section 107F of the Resource Management Act 1991 applies to a panel with the necessary modifications, including the following: the reference to a consent authority must be read as a reference to a panel: the references to submissions must be read as references to comments provided under clause 18: the reference to section 88(3A) of the Resource Management Act 1991 must be read as a reference to clause 4(1) of this schedule: the references to sections 41C, 42A, 92, and 149 of the Resource Management Act 1991 must be read as references to clause 25 of this schedule. A consent applicant or requiring authority may lodge an application for a certificate of compliance with the EPA, but only if the application is lodged at the same time as, and as part of, a consent application or notice of requirement. A panel must consider the application and may issue a certificate of compliance by applying section 139 of the Resource Management Act 1991 with the necessary modifications. Nothing in this schedule prevents a consent applicant or requiring authority from applying to a local authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 for a certificate of compliance in relation to any activity to which this Act applies. This clause applies to a person who is authorised under this Act to apply to a panel for a resource consent or designation for— a listed project; or a referred project. This Act does not prevent that person from lodging, in relation to a listed project or a referred project,— an application for a resource consent under the Resource Management Act 1991; or a notice of requirement under the Resource Management Act 1991. However, a person who has lodged an application for a resource consent or a notice of requirement under the Resource Management Act 1991 in relation to a listed project or a referred project must withdraw that application or notice of requirement before lodging a consent application or notice of requirement under this Act for the same, or substantially the same, activity. When considering a consent application in relation to the conditions to be imposed on a listed project, and any comments received in response to an invitation given under clause 17(2), a panel must, subject to Part 2 of the Resource Management Act 1991 and the purpose of this Act, have regard to— any actual and potential effects on the environment of allowing the activity; and any measure proposed, or agreed to, by the consent applicant to ensure positive effects on the environment to offset or compensate for any adverse effects that will or may result from allowing the activity; and any relevant provisions of any of the documents listed in subclause (2); and any other matter the panel considers relevant and reasonably necessary to determine the application. The documents referred to in subclause (1)﻿(c) are the following: a national environmental standard: other regulations made under the Resource Management Act 1991: a national policy statement: a New Zealand coastal policy statement: a regional policy statement or proposed regional policy statement: a plan or proposed plan: a planning document recognised by a relevant iwi authority and lodged with a local authority. In respect of the matters listed under subclause (1), a panel must apply section 6 of this Act (Treaty of Waitangi) instead of section 8 of the Resource Management Act 1991 (Treaty of Waitangi). If a Treaty settlement imposes an obligation on a local authority or other decision maker when determining an application for a resource consent, a panel must comply with that obligation as if it were the local authority or other decision maker (see example). Compliance with obligations imposed by Treaty settlement Under the Waikato-Tainui Raupatu Claims (Waikato River) Settlement Act 2010, the consent authority must, when making decisions relating to the river, have particular regard to the vision and strategy set out in that Act. A panel determining a relevant consent application or notice of requirement under this Act must comply with that obligation in addition to the obligations imposed by this Act. Subclause (4) is subject to clause 5 of Schedule 5 (conduct of hearings and other procedural matters in context of Treaty settlements). This clause applies only to consent applications for listed projects. When forming an opinion for the purposes of clause 29(1)﻿(a), a panel may disregard an adverse effect of the activity on the environment if a national environmental standard or relevant plan permits an activity with that effect. If a consent application relates to an activity in an area where a planning document prepared by a customary marine title group under section 85 of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 applies, a panel must have regard to any resource management matters in that document until all obligations under section 93 of that Act have been met by the relevant local authority. When considering a consent application or comments received under clause 17(2), a panel must not have regard to trade competition or the effect of trade competition (within the meaning of Part 11A of the Resource Management Act 1991). When considering a consent application for a controlled activity or a restricted discretionary activity, the following rules apply: a panel must grant consent unless any of the grounds described in clause 34 for declining an application apply; and the power of the panel to impose conditions is restricted by the matters over which control or discretion is reserved in a plan or proposed plan, national environmental standard, or other regulations made under the Resource Management Act 1991. When considering a consent application for a discretionary activity, a panel must grant consent unless any of the grounds described in clause 34 for declining an application apply. When considering a consent application for a non-complying activity,— a panel must grant consent unless any of the grounds described in clause 34 for declining an application apply; and to avoid doubt, the test under section 104D of the Resource Management Act 1991 must not be applied.  To avoid doubt,— the matters included in this clause are, in relation to a listed project, relevant to a panel’s decisions on imposing conditions for the listed project, but are not relevant to whether a resource consent is to be granted (see clause 34); and section 104E of the Resource Management Act 1991 does not apply to a panel’s consideration of a resource consent for a listed project. When considering a consent application in relation to a referred project and any comments received in response to an invitation given under section 17(3), a panel must, subject to Part 2 of the Resource Management Act 1991 and the purpose of this Act, have regard to— any actual and potential effects on the environment of allowing the activity; and any measure proposed or agreed to by the consent applicant to ensure positive effects on the environment to offset or compensate for any adverse effects that will or may result from allowing the activity; and any relevant provisions of any of the documents listed in clause 29(2); and any other matter the panel considers relevant and reasonably necessary to determine the consent application. In respect of the matters listed under subclause (1), a panel must apply section 6 of this Act (Treaty of Waitangi) instead of section 8 of the Resource Management Act 1991 (Treaty of Waitangi). If a consent application relates to an activity in an area where a planning document prepared by a customary marine title group under section 85 of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 applies, a panel must have regard to any resource management matters in that document until all obligations under section 93 of that Act have been met by the relevant local authority. When forming an opinion for the purposes of subsection (1)﻿(a), a panel may disregard an adverse effect of the activity on the environment if a national environmental standard or the plan permits an activity with that effect.  A panel must not,— when considering a consent application, have regard to— trade competition or the effects of trade competition; or any effect on a person who has given written approval to the application: grant a resource consent that is contrary to— section 107 of the Resource Management Act 1991 (restriction on grant of certain discharge permits); or section 217 of that Act (effect of water conservation order); or an Order in Council in force under section 152 of that Act (relating to authorisations for coastal tendering); or any regulations made under that Act; or wāhi tapu conditions included in a customary marine title order or agreement; or section 55(2) of the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011 (effect of protected customary rights on resource consent applications). A panel considering a consent application must disregard subclause (5)﻿(a)﻿(ii) if the person withdraws the approval in a written notice received by the panel before the date of the hearing (if any) or, if there is no hearing, before the application is determined. A panel may grant a resource consent on the basis that the activity concerned is a controlled, restricted discretionary, discretionary, or non-complying activity, regardless of what type of activity the application was expressed to be for. A panel may decline a consent application on the ground that the information provided by the consent applicant is inadequate to determine the application. In making an assessment on the adequacy of the information, a panel must have regard to whether any request made to the consent applicant for further information or reports resulted in further information or any report being made available. If a Treaty settlement imposes an obligation on a local authority or other decision maker when determining an application for a resource consent, a panel must comply with that obligation as if it were the local authority or other decision maker (see example relating to clause 29(4)). Subclause (10) is subject to clause 5 of Schedule 5 (conduct of hearings and other procedural matters in context of Treaty settlements). A panel must decline a consent application for a referred project if that is necessary to comply with section 6 (Treaty of Waitangi). Sections 104A to 104D, 105 to 107, and 138A(1), (2), (5), and (6) of the Resource Management Act 1991 apply to a panel’s consideration of a consent application for a referred project. The provisions referred to in subclause (1) apply with all necessary modifications, including that a reference to a consent authority must be read as a reference to a panel. To avoid doubt, section 104E of the Resource Management Act 1991 does not apply to a panel’s consideration of a resource consent for a referred project. When considering a notice of requirement for a listed project or a referred project and any comments received in response to an invitation given under clause 17(2), a panel must not have regard to trade competition or the effects of trade competition (within the meaning of Part 11A of the Resource Management Act 1991). When considering a notice of requirement and any comments received in response to an invitation given under clause 17(2), a panel must, subject to Part 2 of the Resource Management Act 1991 and the purpose of this Act, consider the effects on the environment of allowing the requirement, having particular regard to—  any relevant provisions of the documents listed in subclause (3); and whether adequate consideration has been given to alternative sites, routes, or methods of undertaking the work if— the requiring authority does not have an interest in the land sufficient to undertake the work; or it is likely that the work will have a significant adverse effect on the environment; and whether the work and designation are reasonably necessary for achieving the objectives of the requiring authority seeking the designation; and any other matter the panel considers reasonably necessary in order to make a decision on the requirement.  The documents referred to in subclause (2)﻿(a) are the following: a national policy statement: a New Zealand coastal policy statement: a regional policy statement or proposed regional policy statement: a plan or proposed plan: a planning document recognised by a relevant iwi authority and lodged with a local authority. The effects that are to be considered under subclause (2) may include positive effects on the environment to offset or compensate for any adverse effects on the environment that will or may result from the activity enabled by the designation, but only if those effects result from measures proposed or agreed by the requiring authority. A panel may— cancel a requirement; or confirm a requirement; or confirm a requirement, but modify it or impose conditions on it as the panel thinks fit.  In making its decision under subclause (5), a panel must apply section 6 of this Act (Treaty of Waitangi) instead of section 8 of the Resource Management Act 1991 (Treaty of Waitangi). If a panel confirms a requirement,— it may waive the requirement for an outline plan as required by section 176A of the Resource Management Act 1991; but if it does not waive the requirement under that section, the outline plan must be submitted to the territorial authority in accordance with that section. If a Treaty settlement imposes an obligation on a territorial authority or other decision maker when determining or making a recommendation on a notice of requirement, a panel must comply with that obligation as if it were the territorial authority or other decision maker (see the example relating to clause 29(4)). Subclause (8) is subject to clause 5 of Schedule 5 (conduct of hearings and other procedural matters in context of Treaty settlements). The matters referred to in subclauses (1) to (5) are, in relation to a listed project, relevant to a panel’s decisions on imposing conditions for the listed project, but are not relevant to whether a resource consent is to be granted (see clause 34). A panel may decline a consent application or cancel a notice of requirement for a listed project, but only on the following grounds: that the panel considers that granting a resource consent or confirming or modifying a notice of requirement, with or without conditions, would be inconsistent with any national policy statement, including a New Zealand coastal policy statement: that the panel considers that granting a resource consent or confirming or modifying a notice of requirement, with or without conditions, would be inconsistent with section 6 (Treaty of Waitangi). A panel must grant a resource consent or confirm a requirement for a listed project if neither of the grounds described in subclause (1) applies. This clause applies to consent applications in respect of both listed projects and referred projects. A panel may grant a resource consent subject to the conditions it considers appropriate. Sections 108, 108A to 112, and 220 of the Resource Management Act 1991 apply to conditions imposed under subclause (2), subject to all necessary modifications, including the following: a reference to a consent authority must be read as a reference to a panel; and a reference to services or works must be read as a reference to any activities related to the project that is the subject of the consent application. Before a panel grants a resource consent or confirms or modifies a designation, the panel must provide a copy of its draft conditions to the following, inviting comments on the draft conditions: the consent applicant or requiring authority; and every person or group that provided comments in response to an invitation given under clause 17(2). A panel must set a date by which any comments on the draft conditions must be received by the EPA. The EPA must, as soon as practicable after receiving comments under subclause (1), provide electronic copies of those comments to— the members of the panel; and the consent applicant or requiring authority; and every person or group that provided comments in response to an invitation given under clause 17(2). Sections 123 and 123A of the Resource Management Act 1991 apply to the duration of any resource consents granted by a panel.  Before making its final decision on a consent application or notice of requirement, a panel must have regard to all comments received under subclause (1). As soon as practicable after a panel has completed its consideration of a consent application or notice of requirement, the panel must— make its final decision; and produce a written report of that decision (the decision). The panel must issue its final decision,— in the case of a listed project, no later than 25 working days after the date specified for receiving comments under clause 18; or in the case of a referred project, no later than— 25 working days after the date specified for receiving comments under clause 18, if the referral order is silent on the matter; or  any other number of working days after the date specified for receiving comments under clause 18, as may be provided for in the referral order. However, if the scale or nature of the proposal that is the subject of a consent application or notice of requirement is such that the panel is unable to complete its decision within the time specified in subclause (2), the panel may extend the period for issuing its final decision,— in the case of a listed project, by up to a further 25 working days; or in the case of a referred project,— by up to a further 25 working days, if the referral order is silent on the matter; or  any other number of working days, as may be provided for in the referral order. The period allowed under subclause (2) or (3) does not include any time that a consent application or notice of requirement was suspended— at the direction of the Minister under clause 22; or by a decision of a panel under clause 23. If the panel extends the time under subclause (3), the EPA must give written notice of the extended time to— the consent applicant or requiring authority, as the case requires; and any person or group invited to provide comments under clause 17(2). The written report of the decision must— state the decision made by the panel; and state the panel’s reasons for its decision; and include a statement of the principal issues that were in contention; and include the main findings of the panel on those issues. The decision must also specify the date on which a resource consent or designation lapses unless it is given effect to by the specified date. The date specified under subclause (7) must not be later than 2 years— from the date of commencement, in the case of a resource consent; or  from the date on which a designation is included in a district plan. A resource consent granted under this Act commences on the day after the date on which— all appeal rights under this Act have been exhausted or have expired; or all appeals under this Act are determined. Notice of a decision must be served— on the applicant or requiring authority, as the case requires; and  on any person or group invited to provide comments under clause 17(2); and on the relevant local authority; and on other persons and authorities that the panel considers appropriate. The notice served under subclause (1) must include advice as to the time within which an appeal may be lodged. A decision must be published on an Internet site maintained by the EPA and be free of charge to the public. Section 114(4) of the Resource Management Act 1991 applies to a panel, with the necessary modifications. A panel considering a consent application or notice of requirement that includes multiple activities may issue a series of decisions in stages to enable activities to be started while the panel considers and determines later stages of the project that is the subject of the same application or notice. Subclause (1) does not provide an exception to the time frames that apply under clause 37. At any time during its term of appointment, a panel may issue an amendment to a decision of the panel or an amended direction, correcting minor omissions, errors, or other defects in a decision of the panel. A panel may, within 20 working days of granting a resource consent, correct a resource consent as if it were a consent authority acting under section 133A of the Resource Management Act 1991.  A panel may correct a requirement for a designation before the earlier of the following: the day on which the territorial authority includes the designation in its district plan and any proposed district plan under clause 41; and the day that is 40 working days after the day on which any appeals relating to the requirement have been determined or all rights of appeal under this Act have been exhausted or have expired.  This clause applies as soon as is reasonably practicable— after a panel determining a notice of requirement confirms or modifies a designation (with or without modification); and any right of appeal under clause 44 is exhausted or has expired. As soon as practicable after any right of appeal is exhausted or has expired, the territorial authority must, without using Schedule 1 of the Resource Management Act 1991,— include the designation in its district plan and any proposed district plan, as if it were a rule in the plan or proposed plan; and state in the plan and any proposed plan the name of the requiring authority that has the benefit of the designation. This clause applies to— a resource consent that is granted by a panel; and a designation that is confirmed or modified by a panel and included in a district plan. The local authority that, but for this Act, would have had responsibility— for granting a resource consent under the Resource Management Act 1991 has all the functions, powers, and duties in relation to a resource consent granted under this Act, as if it had granted the resource consent itself; and for recommending, under the Resource Management Act 1991, that a designation be confirmed or modified, has all the functions, powers, and duties in relation to the designation as if it had dealt with the matter itself. Unless otherwise specified in this Act,— a resource consent granted, or a designation confirmed or modified and included in a district plan under this Act has full force and effect for its duration, and according to its terms and conditions, as if it were granted under the Resource Management Act 1991; and any provision of an enactment that refers to a resource consent granted, or a designation confirmed or modified and included in a district plan, under the Resource Management Act 1991 (including any such provision in that Act) must be read, with any necessary modifications, as including a resource consent granted, or a designation confirmed and included in a district plan, under this Act. Section 116A of the Resource Management Act 1991 (when coastal permit for aquaculture may commence) applies to the commencement of any coastal permit to undertake aquaculture activities in the coastal marine area, subject to a reference to a consent authority being read as a reference to the regional council that, but for this Act, would have had responsibility for the coastal permit. To avoid doubt, the functions, powers, and duties referred to in subclause (2) include— the determination of any application to extend a lapse period under section 125(1A) or 184 of the Resource Management Act 1991; and the determination of any application for a change or cancellation of a condition of a resource consent under section 127 of the Resource Management Act 1991. Section 178(2) to (6) of the Resource Management Act 1991 applies, with the necessary modifications, to a notice of requirement lodged with the EPA under clause 2. Any of the following persons may appeal to the High Court against the whole or part of a panel’s final decision made under clause 37 on a consent application or notice of requirement: the consent applicant or requiring authority, as the case requires: any relevant local authority: the Attorney-General: any person or group that provided comments in response to an invitation given under clause 17(2): any person who has an interest in the decision appealed against that is greater than that of the general public. An appeal under this clause may be made only on a question of law. An appeal against a decision of the High Court may be made to the Court of Appeal, but that appeal is a final appeal. A person entitled, and intending, to appeal against a decision of a panel (the appellant) must file a notice of appeal no later than 15 working days after the date on which the person was notified of the decision of the panel under clause 38(1). The notice of appeal must specify— the decision or the part of the decision appealed against; and the error of law alleged by the appellant; and the grounds of appeal with sufficient particularity for the court and other parties to understand them; and the relief sought. No later than the time specified for filing a notice of appeal under subclause (1), the appellant must serve a copy of the notice of appeal on the EPA on behalf of the panel whose decision is subject to the appeal.  No later than 5 working days after the notice of appeal is filed in the High Court, the appellant must serve a copy of the notice of appeal on— the consent applicant or requiring authority, as the case requires (if the appellant is not the consent applicant or requiring authority); and every person or group invited to provide comments under clause 17(2). The panel must provide a copy of the whole decision appealed against to the Registrar of the High Court as soon as is reasonably practicable after receiving the notice of appeal under subclause (3). If a person served with a notice of appeal under subclause (4) wishes to appear at the appeal, the person must serve a notice of intention to appear on— the appellant; and the Registrar of the High Court; and the EPA on behalf of the panel. A notice of intention to appear must be served no later than 10 working days after the day on which the person was served with the notice of appeal under subclause (4). The parties to an appeal under this clause are— the appellant; and any person who gives a notice of intention to appear. The High Court Rules 2016 apply if a procedural matter is not provided for by this clause.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0035/latest/whole.html

Despite clause 22(5), an infringement notice or a cancellation notice referred to in that subclause may be served by sending it by email or other electronic means to the person, instead of the notice being personally delivered or served by post. Clause 22(6) is modified so that if an infringement notice or a cancellation notice is served under clause 22(5) by sending it by email or other electronic means to a person, for the purposes of the Summary Proceedings Act 1957, the notice is treated as being served on the person at the time the email or other electronic communication first enters an information system that is outside the control of the NAIT officer or NAIT authorised person. This clause is repealed when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. This Part amends the Commerce Act 1986. After section 65, insert: In this section and sections 65AB to 65AD, epidemic period means a period— commencing on the day on which this section comes into force; and ending at the close of the 6-month period that starts on the date on which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. A person who wishes to enter into a contract or arrangement, or arrive at an understanding, that the person considers would contain, or may contain, a cartel provision may, during the epidemic period, apply to the Commission for an authorisation to do so and the Commission may grant an authorisation for that person to enter into the contract or arrangement, or arrive at the understanding. A person who wishes to give effect to a provision of a contract or arrangement or understanding that the person considers would contain, or may contain, a cartel provision, may, during the epidemic period, apply to the Commission for an authorisation to do so, and the Commission may grant an authorisation for that person to give effect to the provision of the contract or arrangement or understanding. Subject to the modifications set out in sections 65AB and 65AC,— an authorisation under subsection (2) is to be treated as if it were an authorisation under section 58(1): an authorisation under subsection (3) is to be treated as if it were an authorisation under section 58(2). The modifications set out in this section apply in relation to an application for an authorisation under section 65AA(2) or (3). For the purposes of section 59, a contract that contains a cartel provision must be treated as if it were a contract to which section 27 applies. Section 61(6) must be treated as if it provides that the Commission shall not make a determination granting an authorisation pursuant to an application under section 65AA(2) or (3) unless it is satisfied that— the entering into of the contract or arrangement or the arriving at the understanding; or the giving effect to the cartel provision of the contract, arrangement, or understanding,— as the case may be, to which the application relates, will in all the circumstances result, or be likely to result, in such a benefit to the public that— the entering into of the contract or arrangement or the arriving at the understanding should be permitted; or the giving effect to the cartel provision should be permitted. For the purpose of subsection (3), it is not necessary for the Commission to determine whether a particular provision is in fact a cartel provision, providing there are reasonable grounds for believing it might be. The modifications set out in this section apply in relation to— an application for authorisation under section 58(1) or (2) made during the epidemic period; or an application for an authorisation under section 65AA(2) or (3). Despite section 60(1), the Commission may, in its discretion, waive all or part of any fee payable for the application. Despite section 61(5), the Commission may, in its discretion, determine the application without complying with section 62. This section applies if the Commission receives an application under section 58(1) or (2) or 65AA(2) or (3) during the epidemic period. The Commission may make a determination in writing granting a provisional authorisation for an application under section 58(1) or (2) or 65AA(2) or (3) if the Commission considers it is appropriate to do so— for the purpose of enabling due consideration to be given to the application; or for any other reason. The Commission is not required to comply with section 61(5) to (6A) before granting a provisional authorisation. For the purposes of this section, a reference in any of sections 58A, 58B, 59(1)﻿(a) and (2)﻿(a), 59A, 59B, 61(2), 65, 92, 100, 104, 105, or 106(10) to an authorisation must be treated as if it is a reference to a provisional authorisation. A provisional authorisation remains in force until— the applicant withdraws its application for an authorisation; or the Commission revokes the provisional authorisation under section 65; or the Commission declines or grants the application for an authorisation under section 58(1) or (2) or 65AA(2) or (3). Subsection (5) does not limit the Commission’s ability to grant a provisional authorisation for such period as the Commission sees fit. This section and sections 65AA to 65AD are repealed immediately after the expiry of the 6-month period that starts on the date on which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. In Schedule 1AA, after Part 2, insert: For the purposes of an application that is made during the epidemic period, sections 65AA to 65AD continue to apply as if they remained in force, despite their repeal by section 65AE, to the application including in relation to— any authorisation or provisional authorisation granted on the application: any appeal in relation to a determination of the Commission on the application.

The actions of the director do not breach section 135 if, at the time of taking them, the director, in good faith, is of the opinion that— the company has, or in the next 6 months is likely to have, significant liquidity problems; and the liquidity problems are, or will be, a result of the effects of COVID-19 on the company, its debtors, or its creditors; and it is more likely than not that the company will be able to pay its due debts on and after the date in subclause (3). For the purposes of subclause (2)﻿(c), the date is— 30 September 2021; or any later date prescribed by the regulations. For the purposes of the opinion required by subclause (2)﻿(c), the director may have regard to— the likelihood of trading conditions improving: the likelihood of the company reaching a compromise or other arrangement with its creditors: any other matters the director considers to be relevant. In this clause, regulations means regulations made under clause 10. See clause 4, for companies to which this clause applies. Subclause (2) applies to a director of a company— who, during a safe harbour period, agrees to the company incurring an obligation; and who, at the time of agreeing to the company incurring the obligation, is, in good faith, of the opinion that the company has, or in the next 6 months is likely to have, significant liquidity problems. For the purposes of section 136, the director has reasonable grounds to believe that the company will be able to perform the obligation when it is required to do so if the director, in good faith, is of the opinion that— the liquidity problems are, or will be, a result of the effects of COVID-19 on the company, its debtors, or its creditors; and it is more likely than not that the company will be able to pay its due debts on and after the date in subclause (4). However, subclause (2) only applies if the company incurs the obligation in the safe harbour period. For the purposes of subclause (2)﻿(b), the date is— 30 September 2021; or any later date prescribed by the regulations. For the purposes of the opinion required by subclause (2)﻿(b), the director may have regard to— the likelihood of trading conditions improving: the likelihood of the company reaching a compromise or other arrangement with its creditors: any other matters the director considers to be relevant. In this clause, regulations means regulations made under clause 10. See clause 4, for companies to which this clause applies. A person who wishes to rely on a provision of this schedule in a proceeding for, or relating to, a breach of section 135 or 136 has the burden of proving that the provision applies. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Ministers, make regulations that prescribe classes of companies, or classes of transactions or other circumstances, for the purposes of clause 4, including providing for either or both of the following: for clause 6 or 7, or both, to apply only if conditions prescribed in the regulations are satisfied: for clause 6 or 7, or both, to cease to apply if conditions prescribed in the regulations are not satisfied. Before recommending the making of regulations under subclause (1), the Ministers must have regard to— the provisions of clause 1 (which relates to the purpose of this schedule); and the effect of the regulations on— the creditors of companies that have significant liquidity problems; and the integrity of corporate insolvency law. Different matters may be prescribed in respect of different classes of companies, transactions, or other circumstances. See also clause 10 (for regulations prescribing a benchmark date). The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Ministers, make regulations that— extend the initial safe harbour period until no later than 31 March 2021: provide for clause 6 or 7, or both, to apply for a new safe harbour period— of no more than 6 months; and that ends no later than the close of 30 September 2021. The powers in subclause (1)﻿(a) and (b) may each be exercised once only. However, the Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Ministers,— revoke regulations made under subclause (1) (wholly or in part): amend regulations made under subclause (1) to reduce the period of an extension or a new safe harbour period. The Ministers must not recommend the making of regulations under subclause (1) unless the Ministers— have had regard to the provisions of clause 1 (which relates to the purpose of this schedule); and are satisfied that the extension or new safe harbour period is— necessary or desirable to address the effects of COVID-19; and no longer than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to it. Regulations made under subclause (1)﻿(a) may prescribe a date for the purposes of clauses 6(3) and 7(4), but that date must be no later than 31 March 2022. Regulations made under subclause (1)﻿(b) may do either or both of the following: prescribe a benchmark date under clause 4(1)﻿(a), being a date that is— no earlier than 30 June 2020; and no later than the date that is 3 months before the start of the new safe harbour period: prescribe a date, for the purposes of clauses 6(3) and 7(4), but that date must be not later than 18 months after the start of the new safe harbour period. Subclauses (5) and (6) do not limit subclause (1). A purpose of this schedule is to provide for the business, property, and affairs of an entity that is facing significant liquidity problems, or an entity that may in the future face such problems, because of the effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 to operate in a way that— maximises the chances of the entity, or as much as possible of its business, continuing in existence; or if it is not possible for the entity or its business to continue in existence, results in a better return for the entity’s creditors and members than would result from an immediate liquidation of the entity. In addition, it is a purpose of this schedule to give an entity referred to in subclause (1) some temporary protections relating to its debts in order to give it an opportunity to develop, with its creditors, a longer-term approach to its liquidity problems. However, it is not a purpose of this schedule to— facilitate the ability of an entity that has no realistic prospect of continuing to trade or operate in the medium or long term to defer a decision to enter into liquidation to the detriment of its creditors; or allow any debts owing by an entity to be cancelled; or allow the rights of a creditor to be varied, in any significant way, after the end of the temporary period of protection. This schedule provides for certain entities to enter into business debt hibernation (BDH). If an entity is in BDH, certain protections apply. These protections temporarily prevent certain actions being taken by the entity’s creditors and other persons (see Part 5). In summary (and subject to Part 6),— a mortgage or other charge over the entity’s property is unenforceable: an owner or a lessor must not recover property used by the entity: a proceeding in a court, a tribunal, or an arbitral tribunal must not be begun or continued against the entity: enforcement processes against the entity are halted. The protections do not apply in relation to a creditor with security over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the entity’s property. The protections start when the entity delivers to the Registrar a notice that the entity is entering into BDH (see Part 2). A copy of the notice must be sent to each known creditor. The protection initially lasts for up to 1 month. This is to give the entity and its creditors an opportunity to consider an arrangement to deal with the entity’s situation. If the arrangement is approved by a majority of the creditors in number and value, the protection may continue for a further 6 months (see Part 3). The process for obtaining the creditors’ approval of the arrangement is set out in Part 4. That Part also sets out the effects of an approved arrangement. In particular, the permitted scope of an arrangement is narrower than a compromise under Part 14 of the Companies Act 1993 (for example, an arrangement cannot involve any cancellation of the debts of an entity). The protections are subject to certain rights of creditors and other persons under Part 6. While the entity is in BDH, certain voidable transaction provisions do not apply. This is intended to encourage businesses to keep transacting with the entity (see Part 7). This clause is only a guide to the general scheme and effect of this schedule.  This schedule applies to a company or any other kind of entity (as defined in clause 4(1)). However, this schedule does not apply to any of the following: a registered bank within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989: a licensed insurer: an NBDT within the meaning of section 5 of the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013: an operator of a designated settlement system within the meaning of section 156M(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989: an entity that holds a market services licence that covers the service of acting as a derivatives issuer in respect of a regulated offer of derivatives (as those terms are defined in section 6(1) of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013):  an entity that is in liquidation, in voluntary administration, subject to a deed of company arrangement, or subject to statutory management: an entity if a receiver has been appointed in relation to the whole or substantially the whole of the assets and undertaking of the entity:  an entity that is subject to any other process (whether in New Zealand or another country) under which the assets and affairs of the entity are administered, or the assets of the entity are realised, for the benefit of creditors:  a qualifying counterparty within the meaning of section 122A(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989: an entity formed or established on or after 3 April 2020: an entity of a class prescribed by the regulations. In addition,— this schedule— does not apply in the circumstances prescribed in the regulations; and ceases to apply if conditions prescribed in the regulations are not satisfied; and an entity may not enter into BDH after the later of— 24 December 2020; and any later date prescribed by the regulations. If an entity enters into BDH before the date that applies under subclause (3)﻿(b), nothing in that paragraph prevents the entity from continuing as an entity in BDH after that date. In this schedule, unless the context otherwise requires,— arrangement— means any arrangement between an entity and its creditors (including an arrangement that relates to the governance or management of the entity); but does not include an arrangement to the extent that it contravenes clause 30 BDH means business debt hibernation under this schedule board means,— in relation to a company within the meaning of this Act, the board of the company: in relation to a partnership (other than a limited partnership), the partners: in relation to a limited partnership, the general partners: in relation to a body corporate or unincorporate, other than a company, partnership, or limited partnership, the committee or other governing body by whatever name called broker has the same meaning as in section 77A(1) of the Financial Advisers Act 2008 creditor— includes— a person who, in a liquidation, would be entitled to claim in accordance with section 303 that a debt or liability is owing to that person by the entity; and a secured creditor; but does not include a person to the extent that the person is owed or must be paid an excluded debt director means,—  in relation to a company or an overseas company, any person occupying the position of a director of the company, by whatever name called: in relation to a partnership (other than a limited partnership), any partner: in relation to a limited partnership, any general partner: in relation to a body corporate or unincorporate, other than a company, partnership, or limited partnership, any person occupying a position in the body that is comparable with that of a director of a company electronic vote has the meaning set out in subclause (2) enforce, in relation to a charge over property of an entity in BDH, includes— to appoint a receiver of property of the entity under a power contained in an instrument relating to the charge: to obtain an order for the appointment of a receiver of that property for the purpose of enforcing the charge: to enter into possession, or assume control, of that property for that purpose: to appoint a person to enter into possession or assume control (whether as agent for the secured creditor or for the entity) for that purpose: to exercise, as secured creditor or as a receiver or person so appointed, a right, power, or remedy existing because of the charge, whether arising under an instrument relating to the charge, under a written or unwritten law, or otherwise enforcement process, in relation to property, means— execution against that property; or any other enforcement process in relation to that property that involves a court or a sheriff (within the meaning of section 239C) enters into BDH has the meaning set out in subclause (4) entity means any of the following: a company: an overseas company registered under Part 18 of this Act: a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008: an overseas limited partnership registered under that Act: any other body corporate: a partnership (within the meaning of the Partnership Law Act 2019): an unincorporated body of persons entity in BDH has the meaning set out in subclause (4) excluded debt— means— a debt that was incurred after the entity enters into BDH; or any salary, wages, or other amounts owed by the entity to an employee in connection with the employment relationship; or any amount withheld or deducted from the salary or wages of an employee as required by the Income Tax Act 2007, the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Child Support Act 1991, the KiwiSaver Act 2006, or the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and any such amount that should have been withheld or deducted from the salary or wages by the entity; or any amount payable by an entity to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in accordance with subpart 3 of Part 3 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006; or any other amount payable by an entity to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that is subject to an instalment arrangement under section 177B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that was entered into before the entity enters into BDH; or any other debt or claim of a kind prescribed in the regulations; but does not include— interest or penalties (regardless of when they fall due for payment) if the interest or penalties relate to a debt that was incurred before the entity enters into BDH; or any other amount that falls due for payment after the entity enters into BDH if the obligation to pay the amount is imposed under a contract or a deed that was entered into by the entity before the entity enters into BDH general security holder has the meaning set out in clause 21 protection period has the meaning set out in clause 13 regulations means regulations made under section 395B secured creditor, in relation to an entity, means a person entitled to a charge on or over property owned by that entity  voting date means— the last date on which a creditor may vote on the resolution referred to in clause 9; or if the entity decides to hold a meeting of creditors to vote on that resolution, the date of the meeting. For the purposes of this schedule, a creditor may make an electronic vote by giving the creditor’s vote in electronic form, whether by means of an electronic communication or otherwise (for example, a vote sent by email). In subclause (2), electronic and electronic communication have the same meanings as in section 209 of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017. For the purposes of this schedule, an entity— is an entity in BDH if the protections in Part 5 of this schedule apply to the entity; and enters into BDH when the protections in Part 5 of this schedule start to apply to the entity (see clause 14). Any term or expression that is defined or used in another part of this Act and used in this schedule has, in relation to an entity other than a company, the same meaning as in the other part of this Act (but applied with all necessary modifications as if it were a company). The board of an entity may agree to the entity entering into BDH if,— as at 31 December 2019, the entity was able to pay its debts as they became due in the normal course of business; and at least 80% of the directors of the entity vote in favour of a resolution for the entity to enter into BDH; and each director who votes in favour of the resolution has signed a certificate that—  states that, as at 31 December 2019, the entity was able to pay its debts as they became due in the normal course of business; and includes statements about the matters set out in subclause (2); and sets out the grounds for the opinions referred to in that subclause; and each of the directors who vote in favour of the resolution are acting in good faith. For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(c)﻿(ii), the director must state that, in good faith, the director is of the opinion that,— the entity has, or in the next 6 months is likely to have, significant liquidity problems; and the liquidity problems are, or will be, a result of the effects of COVID-19 on the entity, its debtors, or its creditors; and it is more likely than not that the entity will be able to pay its due debts on and after the date in subclause (3). For the purposes of subclause (2)﻿(c), the date is— 30 September 2021; or any later date prescribed by the regulations. For the purposes of the opinion required by subclause (2)﻿(c), the director may have regard to— the likelihood of trading conditions improving: the likelihood of a proposed arrangement being approved by its creditors under this schedule (or of the entity reaching a compromise or other arrangement with its creditors): any other matters they consider to be relevant. Subclause (1)﻿(a) and (c)﻿(i) does not apply to an entity that was formed or established on or after 1 January 2020 but before 3 April 2020. This clause provides for how an entity may enter into BDH (and receive the benefit of the protections in Part 5 of this schedule). The entity enters into BDH by delivering to the Registrar a notice that—  states that the board of the entity has agreed to the entity entering into BDH under clause 5; and states the legal name and the address of the entity (including the registered office of the entity (if any)); and states the entity’s New Zealand Business Number (if any); and states the address (which may be an electronic address) and telephone number to which inquiries may be directed during normal business hours. The board of the entity must send to each known creditor a copy of the notice under clause 6 as soon as is reasonably practicable after the notice is delivered to the Registrar under that clause. The notice sent to creditors under subclause (1) must— contain, or be accompanied by, a copy of each certificate signed under clause 5; and contain at least a high-level description of a proposed arrangement between the entity and its creditors that is intended to address the entity’s significant liquidity problems; and include the information specified in subclause (4)﻿(b) and (c); and state the address (which may be an electronic address) and telephone number to which inquiries may be directed during normal business hours; and state the date on which the notice is delivered to the Registrar under clause 6. The notice that is sent to a creditor must also specify the amount owing or estimated to be owing to that particular creditor. For the purposes of this clause, the entity must compile a list of creditors known to the entity, setting out— the amount owing or estimated to be owing to each of them; and the total amount owing or estimated to be owing to the creditors; and the number of creditors. If the entity is a broker, the board of the entity must send to the FMA a copy of the notice under clause 6 as soon as is reasonably practicable after the notice is delivered to the Registrar under that clause. If the board of an entity fails to comply with this clause, every director of the entity commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000.  If a protection period has started as a result of an entity complying with clause 6, the entity may not, at any time, deliver a subsequent notice under that clause. Accordingly, an entity may not enter into BDH more than once. However, this clause does not apply if— the court orders otherwise (on an application made by the entity); or the regulations permit a subsequent notice to be delivered.  This clause facilitates a vote by the entity’s creditors to approve an arrangement proposed by the entity. See clause 15, which provides that the protections of BDH will cease after 1 month unless the creditors vote to approve the arrangement. The entity must— prepare a final proposed arrangement; and send to each known creditor a notice that—  requests that the entity’s creditors vote on a resolution to approve the proposed arrangement (the resolution); and includes the matters set out in clause 10. The notice must be sent and received not less than 5 working days before the voting date. The voting date must be before the expiry of the 1-month period that starts on the date on which the entity enters into BDH (see clause 14). See section 392 (which provides for when a notice is deemed to have been received). The notice under clause 9 must— describe the proposed arrangement in sufficient detail to enable a creditor to form a reasoned judgment in relation to it (including the terms of the proposed arrangement and the reasons for it); and set out the text of the resolution to be voted on; and explain when and how a creditor may vote on the resolution, including the voting date and the manner of voting (for example, the notice may state that the creditor may email its vote to a particular email address before a particular time on a particular date); and explain that the proposed arrangement will be binding on all creditors if approved in accordance with clause 23; and explain that a related creditor’s vote on the resolution must be disregarded unless the court orders otherwise (see clauses 32 to 35); and state the name of the person authorised to receive and count votes; and contain the information required under clause 11 (if any); and contain all other information (if any) required by the regulations. The notice may include any other information that the entity considers is useful to its creditors. The information about when and how a creditor may vote on the resolution must— give the creditors a fair and reasonable opportunity to participate in the vote; and comply with all other requirements prescribed by the regulations (if any). Subclause (3) is subject to clauses 32 to 35 (which may prevent related creditors from voting). An entity is not required to hold a meeting of creditors to vote on a resolution to approve the proposed arrangement. However, if the entity decides to hold a meeting of creditors the notice sent under clause 9 must include a statement of the following (as applicable): the time and place of the meeting to be held under clause 55(a): the time and method of communication for the meeting to be held under clause 55(b): the time and address for the return of voting information for the meeting to be held under clause 55(a), (b), or (c). If a meeting of creditors is held, it must be conducted in accordance with Part 8 of this schedule (subject to the modifications, additions, or variations specified in the regulations). An irregularity in or a failure to receive a notice under clause 9 does not invalidate a vote by creditors if— the irregularity or failure is not material; or in the case of a meeting of creditors being held, all the creditors entitled to attend and vote at the meeting attend the meeting without protest as to the irregularity or failure; or all the creditors entitled to vote agree to waive the irregularity or failure. This Part sets out when the protections in Part 5 of this schedule apply. In this schedule, the protection period is the period during which the protections in Part 5 of this schedule apply. Part 5 of this schedule starts to apply (and the entity enters into BDH) when the entity has delivered to the Registrar a notice under clause 6. Part 5 of this schedule ceases to apply on the earlier of the following: immediately after the expiry of the 1-month period that starts when the entity enters into BDH (see clause 14): at the close of the voting date, if the proposed arrangement is not approved under clause 23. However, if the arrangement is approved under clause 23, Part 5 of this schedule continues to apply until the expiry of the 6-month period that starts on the date of the approval. This clause is subject to clauses 16 to 22. If the approval under clause 23 is given subject to the entity complying with 1 or more conditions and the entity materially fails to comply with any of those conditions, Part 5 of this schedule ceases to apply. During the protection period, a creditor may request that—  at least 80% of the directors of the entity sign new certificates that comply with clause 5(1)﻿(c); and the entity sends to the creditor a copy of those certificates within 5 working days after the request is received. The entity must comply with the request unless the entity has complied with another request under this clause from the creditor or another creditor within the previous 2-month period. If the entity relies on subclause (2), the entity must instead, within that 5-working-day period, send to the creditor a copy of the certificates sent for the other request. Part 5 of this schedule ceases to apply if the entity fails to comply with this clause. This clause applies if, after the entity enters into BDH,— a compromise is approved under section 230 in relation to the entity; or the court orders that an arrangement or a compromise be binding on the entity under section 236; or a vote on a compromise is held at a meeting of creditors or a class of creditors in accordance with Schedule 5 but the compromise is not adopted in accordance with clause 5 of that schedule; or voluntary administration of the entity begins under Part 15A of this Act; or a receiver is appointed for the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of the entity; or the entity is put into liquidation. Part 5 of this schedule ceases to apply, in the case of— subclause (1)﻿(a), when the compromise comes into effect: subclause (1)﻿(b), when the order comes into effect: subclause (1)﻿(c), at the close of the meeting: subclause (1)﻿(d), when the voluntary administration begins: subclause (1)﻿(e), when the receiver is appointed: subclause (1)﻿(f), when the liquidation commences. This clause applies if a majority of the directors of an entity that is in BDH vote in favour of a resolution for the entity to cease to be an entity in BDH before the end of the protection period that would otherwise apply. The board of the entity may deliver to the Registrar a notice that states that the board of the entity has agreed to the entity ceasing to be an entity in BDH on a date specified in the notice (the specified date). The specified date must be at least 5 working days after the date on which the notice is delivered to the Registrar. Part 5 of this schedule ceases to apply on the close of the specified date. The board of the entity must send to each known creditor a copy of the notice under subclause (2) as soon as is reasonably practicable after the notice is delivered to the Registrar. If the board of an entity fails to comply with subclause (5), every director of the entity commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000. If approval under clause 23 is given, Part 5 of this schedule applies subject to the modifications or variations specified in the arrangement that limit or reduce the protections provided by those provisions. Part 5 of this schedule does not apply in relation to a general security holder of an entity in BDH (or to the debts owing to the general security holder). In particular, nothing in this schedule prevents any of the following persons from enforcing a charge referred to in subclause (4): the general security holder: a receiver or person appointed as mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), or (d) of the definition of enforce in clause 4(1) as that definition applies in relation to the charge (regardless of when the receiver or person is appointed). Subclause (2) does not limit subclause (1). In this schedule, general security holder, in relation to an entity, means a secured creditor that— holds a charge on or over the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of the entity; or holds 2 or more charges on or over the property of the entity where the property that is subject to those charges together constitutes the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of the entity. Part 5 of this schedule does not apply in relation to excluded debts. An arrangement is approved by creditors if the arrangement is adopted in accordance with clause 24. This clause and clause 24 are subject to clauses 32 to 35 (which may prevent a related creditor from voting). A resolution to approve a proposed arrangement is adopted if— a majority in number and value of the creditors who are entitled to vote and who vote on the proposal, vote in favour of the resolution; and all other requirements prescribed in the regulations (if any) are satisfied. The value attributed to creditors must not include any excluded debt (and, accordingly, every amount of excluded debt must be disregarded). A person (A) who is authorised to receive and count votes that have been made on a resolution to approve a proposed arrangement must— collect together all votes that have been made; and count the number of creditors voting in favour of the resolution and determine the total amount of the debts owed by the entity to those creditors (see clause 24(2), which provides for excluded debts to be disregarded); and count the number of creditors voting against the resolution and determine the total amount of the debts owed by the entity to those creditors (see clause 24(2), which provides for excluded debts to be disregarded); and sign a certificate— that certifies that A has carried out the duties set out in paragraphs (a) to (c); and that states whether A is relying on subclause (2); and if A is relying on subclause (2), that describes how A has made the assessment or estimate referred to in that subclause; and that states the results of the counts and determinations required by paragraphs (b) and (c); and ensure that the certificate required by paragraph (d) is given to the entity. If A, acting in good faith, considers there is uncertainty about—  whether a person is a creditor, A may act under this clause on the basis of a reasonable assessment of whether the person is a creditor: whether a person is a related creditor, A may act under this clause on the basis of a reasonable assessment of whether the person is a related creditor: the amount owing to a creditor, A may act under this clause on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the amount that is owing.  Nothing in subclause (2), clause 27 or 28, or any other provision in this schedule prevents a court from making a determination about whether a resolution to approve a proposed arrangement was, in fact, approved under clause 23. The person who is acting under clause 25 must not determine amounts by reference to different classes of creditor (but this does not limit clauses 32 to 35). The board of the entity must, as soon as practicable, prepare a certificate of the result of the vote, including— a statement of whether the arrangement was approved under clause 23; and a statement of the terms of the arrangement (if it is approved). The certificate is evidence of the outcome of the vote (unless the contrary is proved). If the board of an entity fails to comply with subclause (1), every director of the entity commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000.  The board of the entity must ensure that, as soon as practicable,— a copy of each certificate under clauses 25 and 27 is sent to each known creditor of the entity; and there is delivered to the Registrar a notice of the outcome of the vote and a statement of whether the arrangement was approved under clause 23. If the entity is a broker, the board of the entity must send to the FMA a copy of the notice and statement referred to in subclause (1)﻿(b) as soon as is reasonably practicable after the notice and statement are delivered to the Registrar. If the board of an entity fails to comply with subclause (1) or (2), every director of the entity commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000.  An arrangement approved by the creditors of an entity in accordance with this schedule is— binding on the entity; and binding on all creditors to whom notice was sent under clause 9. This clause is subject to clauses 21 and 30.  The arrangement must not have the effect of— cancelling all or part of a debt of the entity that is owing to a creditor; or varying the rights of a creditor or the terms of that debt (other than a variation specified in subclause (2) or permitted under subclause (3)); or preventing the exercise of any of the creditor’s powers, or restricting any of the creditor’s rights, after the end of the protection period. For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(b), the arrangement may have the effect of— reducing the amount of any payment to be made by the entity to a creditor during the protection period (without a consequential change being made to an annual interest rate): postponing, during a protection period, the dates on which payments are to be made by the entity to a creditor (without a consequential change being made to the annual interest rate or annual interest rates): preventing the exercise of any of the creditor’s powers, or restricting any of the creditor’s rights, to enforce payment of the due debt during the protection period. An arrangement may provide that, during the protection period, an entity will pay each of its existing creditors 40 cents for each dollar that they would otherwise be paid. The other 60 cents in the dollar will remain owing and will need to be paid in the future (unless the creditor later agrees otherwise) because the arrangement only defers payment of an amount. It may not cancel any part of the debt. For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(b), the arrangement may also— have an effect that is incidental or consequential on an effect that is permitted under subclause (2) (whether during or after the protection period); and have any other effect permitted under the regulations (whether during or after the protection period). Subclauses (2) and (3) are subject to subclause (1)﻿(a) (that is, the arrangement must not have the effect of cancelling all or part of a debt). A provision of the arrangement that contravenes this clause is of no effect to the extent of the contravention.  Nothing in this clause limits the application of Part 5 in relation to the creditor. An arrangement approved under clause 23 may be varied— in accordance with any procedure for variation incorporated in the arrangement as approved; or by the approval of a variation of the arrangement in accordance with this schedule, which, for that purpose, applies with all necessary modifications as if the proposed variation were a proposed arrangement. A variation made as referred to in subclause (1)﻿(a) must be notified to the Registrar and can have no effect before that happens. The provisions of this schedule apply to any arrangement that is varied in accordance with this clause. A variation may not purport to extend the length of the protection period. The entity (and the person who is acting under clause 25) must disregard a related creditor’s vote on a resolution to approve a proposed arrangement unless the court orders otherwise. A related creditor may apply to the court for an order that its vote be taken into account. A related creditor that intends to apply for an order must,— before a vote is taken on the resolution, send notice in writing to the entity that the creditor— is a related creditor; and intends to apply to the court for an order that its vote be taken into account; and within 5 working days of the meeting of creditors, make an application to the court. The court may make an order that a related creditor’s vote be taken into account only if satisfied that ordering that the applicant’s vote (or the applicants’ votes) be taken into account— is not contrary to the interests of the creditors, or a class of creditors, as a whole; and will not prejudice, and is not reasonably likely to prejudice, the interests of the creditors to an extent that is unreasonable having regard to— the benefits accruing to the applicant (or the applicants), or to some or all of the related creditors, from the resolution or from the failure to pass the resolution; and the nature of the relationship between the applicant (or the applicants) and the entity, or between the related creditors and the entity; and any other relevant matter. In this schedule,—  related creditor means a creditor who is a related person of the entity related person means, in relation to an entity,— a promoter; or a relative or spouse of a promoter; or a relative of a spouse of a promoter; or a director, shareholder, or other member; or a relative or spouse of a director, shareholder, or other member; or a relative of a spouse of a director, shareholder, or other member; or a related body corporate (within the meaning of section 12(2) of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013); or another entity of which a director is also a director of the entity relative has the same meaning as in clause 5(2) of Schedule 1 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (applied with all necessary modifications). If the entity (or the person who is acting under clause 25) considers that a creditor that votes on a resolution to approve a proposed arrangement is a related creditor, and the creditor has not sent a notice under clause 32, the entity or person must (unless the court orders otherwise)— disregard the creditor’s vote; and  send a notice in writing to the creditor stating the reasons for the entity’s or person’s view. The court may, on the application of the creditor, order that the creditor’s vote be taken into account if satisfied that the creditor is not a related creditor. The creditor must make any application under this clause to the court within 5 working days of receiving the notice. If the court orders, under clause 32 or 33, that a creditor’s vote be taken into account, the court may also do 1 or more of the following: order that the resolution be set aside or treated as having passed: order that a new vote be held on the resolution: order that the protection period is extended by a period that the court thinks fit to allow a new vote to be held on the resolution: make any other orders that the court thinks necessary. Despite any application under clause 32 or 33, the outcome of the vote on the resolution is valid and effective unless the court orders otherwise. Subclauses (2) and (3) apply in relation to a resolution to approve a proposed arrangement if,— after the voting is completed, the board of the entity becomes aware that a creditor that voted on the resolution is a related creditor; and the board is satisfied that,— in accordance with clause 32 or 33, the related creditor’s vote should have been disregarded; and the resolution would not have been passed or defeated if the vote cast by the related creditor (or, if there is more than 1 related creditor, the votes cast by the related creditors) had been disregarded. Despite clause 32(1) or 33(1), the outcome of the vote on the resolution is valid and effective unless the court orders otherwise under subclause (4). The board of the entity must, as soon as practicable after becoming aware that this subclause applies to the resolution, send a notice of that fact to every known creditor. The court may, on the application of the entity or a creditor, do 1 or more of the following: order that the resolution be set aside or treated as having passed: order that a new vote be held on the resolution: order that a specified related creditor or creditors must not vote or may vote on the resolution: order that the protection period is extended by a period that the court thinks fit to allow a new vote to be held on the resolution: make any other orders that the court thinks necessary. If the board of an entity fails to comply with subclause (3), every director of the entity commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000. On the application of the entity, the court may— give directions in relation to a procedural requirement imposed by this schedule, or waive or vary any such requirement, if satisfied that it would be just to do so; or order that, during a period specified in the order, beginning not earlier than the date on which notice was sent about the proposed arrangement and ending not later than 5 working days after the date on which notice was sent of the result of the voting on it,— proceedings in relation to a debt owing by the entity be stayed; or a creditor refrain from taking any other measure to enforce payment of a debt owing by the entity. Subclause (1)﻿(b) does not apply in relation to— any debt that is owed by the entity to a general security holder; or any excluded debt. The court may order that a creditor is not bound by an arrangement, or make any other order that it thinks fit, if the court is satisfied that— insufficient notice of the matters required to be notified under clause 7 or 9 was sent to the creditor (or no notice was received by the creditor); or clause 10(3) was materially contravened in relation to the creditor; or there was some other material irregularity in obtaining approval of the arrangement; or in the case of a creditor who voted against the arrangement, the arrangement is unfairly prejudicial to the creditor.  An arrangement is not unfairly prejudicial to a creditor merely because the creditor is a secured creditor (or has a preferential claim under Schedule 7) and other creditors are not secured creditors (or do not have a preferential claim). An application under this clause— may only be made by a creditor of the entity who was entitled to vote on the arrangement; and must be made not later than 10 working days after the date on which notice of the result of the voting was sent to the creditor under clause 28. A person must not, during the protection period for an entity in BDH, enforce a charge over the property of the entity, except— with the permission of the court; or in accordance with terms of an arrangement that has been approved under clause 23. This clause is subject to Part 6. During the protection period for an entity in BDH, the owner or lessor of property that is used or occupied by, or is in the possession of, the entity must not take possession of the property or otherwise recover it, except— with the entity’s written consent; or with the permission of the court; or in accordance with terms of an arrangement that has been approved under clause 23. During the protection period for an entity in BDH, a proceeding against the entity in connection with a debt or in relation to any of its property must not be begun or continued, except— with the entity’s written consent; or with the permission of the High Court and in accordance with the terms that the High Court imposes; or in accordance with terms of an arrangement that has been approved under clause 23. This clause does not apply to a proceeding against the entity in connection with—  a debt that is owed by the entity to a general security holder; or an excluded debt. In this clause, proceeding means a proceeding in the High Court or any other court, a tribunal, or an arbitral tribunal. An entity is not liable in damages for a refusal to give an approval or consent for the purposes of this schedule. During the protection period for an entity in BDH, an enforcement process in relation to the entity’s property must not be begun or continued except with the permission of the court and in accordance with the terms that the court imposes. This clause applies to a sheriff or registrar or other appropriate officer of the court (a court officer) who receives written notice that an entity is in BDH under this schedule. During the protection period for the entity, the court officer must not— take action to sell property of the entity under an execution process; or pay to a person (other than the entity)— proceeds of the sale of the entity’s property (at any time) under an execution process; or money of the entity seized (at any time) under an execution process; or money paid (at any time) to avoid the seizure or sale of property of the entity under an execution process; or take action in relation to the attachment of a debt due to the entity; or pay to any person (other than the entity) money received because of the attachment of a debt due to the entity. The court officer must deliver to the entity any property of the entity that is in the court officer’s possession under an execution process (whenever begun). The court officer must pay to the entity all proceeds or money of a kind referred to in subclause (2)﻿(b) or (d) that— is in the court officer’s possession; or has been paid into the court and has not since been paid out. The costs of the execution or attachment are a first charge over property delivered under subclause (3) or proceeds or money paid under subclause (4). In order to give effect to a charge under subclause (5) on proceeds or money the court officer may retain, on behalf of the person entitled to the charge, so much of the proceeds as the court officer thinks necessary. The court may, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so, permit the court officer to take action, or make a payment, that subclause (2) would otherwise prevent. A person who buys property in good faith under a sale under an execution process obtains a good title to the property as against the entity, despite anything else in this schedule. During the protection period for an entity in BDH, except with the court’s permission and in accordance with the terms that the court may impose, a guarantee of a liability of the entity must not be enforced against— a director of the entity; or a shareholder or other member of the entity; or the spouse or relative of a director, a shareholder, or any other member of the entity. In this clause,— liability means a debt, liability, or other obligation relative has the same meaning as in clause 5(2) of Schedule 1 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (applied with all necessary modifications). This clause applies if, before the start of the protection period, a secured creditor, receiver, or other person, for the purpose of enforcing a charge over the property,— entered into possession, or assumed control, of the property of the entity; or entered into an agreement to sell the property; or made arrangements for the property to be offered for sale by public auction; or publicly invited tenders for the purchase of the property; or exercised any other power in relation to the property. Nothing in clause 38 prevents the secured creditor, receiver, or other person from enforcing the charge in relation to the property. This clause applies if perishable property of an entity in BDH is subject to a charge. Nothing in clause 38 prevents the secured creditor, a receiver, or a person appointed (at any time) as mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), or (d) of the definition of enforce in clause 4(1) from enforcing the charge, so far as it is a charge over perishable property. This clause— applies if,— for the purpose of enforcing a charge over property of an entity, the secured creditor, a receiver, or other person does an act of a kind referred to in clause 45; and the entity is an entity in BDH when the secured creditor, receiver, or other person does that act; but does not apply in connection with the enforcement of a charge that is held by a general security holder. On an application by the entity, the court may order the secured creditor, receiver, or other person not to perform specified functions or exercise specified powers, except as permitted by the order. The court may make an order only if satisfied that what the entity proposes to do during the protection period will adequately protect the secured creditor’s interests. An order— may be made only, and has effect only, during the protected period; and has effect despite clauses 45 and 46. Clause 38 does not prevent a person from giving a notice under the provisions of a security agreement. This clause applies if, before the protection period, a receiver or other person, for the purpose of enforcing a right of the owner or lessor of the property to take possession of the property or otherwise recover it,— entered into possession of, or assumed control of, property used or occupied by, or in the possession of, the entity; or exercised any other power in relation to the property. Clause 39 does not prevent the receiver or other person from performing a function, or exercising a power, in relation to the property. Nothing in clause 39 prevents a person from taking possession of, or otherwise recovering, perishable property. This clause applies if,— for the purpose of enforcing a right of the owner or lessor of property used or occupied by, or in the possession of, an entity to take possession of the property or otherwise recover it, a person— enters into possession, or assumes control, of the property; or exercises any other power in relation to the property; and the entity is in BDH when the person does so. On an application by the entity, the court may order the person not to perform specified functions, or exercise specified powers, in relation to the property, except as permitted by the order. The court may make an order only if satisfied that what the entity proposes to do during the protection period will adequately protect the interests of the owner or lessor. An order— may be made only, and has effect only, during the protection period; and has effect despite clauses 49 and 50. Nothing in clause 39 prevents a person from giving a notice to an entity under an agreement relating to property that is used or occupied by, or is in the possession of, the entity. The provisions referred to in subclause (2) do not apply to a transaction by an entity in BDH if—  the transaction is— entered into by the entity during the protection period; or specifically authorised under an arrangement that has been approved under clause 23; and the transaction is entered into by all the parties— in good faith; and on arm’s-length terms. The provisions are— section 292 (which relates to insolvent transactions) and sections 294 to 296 to the extent that those sections relate to section 292; and subpart 6 of Part 6 of the Property Law Act 2007 (which relates to setting aside dispositions that prejudice creditors). A transaction between an entity and another party (P) is on arm’s-length terms if the terms— would be reasonable in the circumstances if the parties were connected or related only by the transaction in question, each acting independently, and each acting in its own best interests; or are less favourable to P than the terms referred to in paragraph (a). In this clause, transaction includes a disposition within the meaning of section 345 of the Property Law Act 2007. Section 92 of the Limited Partnerships Act 2008 applies subject to this clause. This Part applies only if a meeting of creditors is held for the purposes of this schedule. However, this Part applies subject to the modifications, additions, or variations specified in the regulations. A meeting of creditors may be held in 1 or more of the following ways: by assembling together those creditors who are entitled to take part and who choose to attend at the place, date, and time appointed for the meeting: by means of audio, or audio and visual, communication by which all creditors participating can simultaneously hear each other throughout the meeting: by conducting a postal or an electronic vote in accordance with clause 60 of those creditors entitled to take part. If the meeting of creditors agrees, the chairperson may adjourn the meeting from time to time and from place to place. An adjourned meeting must be held in the same place unless another place is specified in the resolution for the adjournment. An adjournment does not extend the protection period (and, in all cases, the voting date must continue to be before the expiry of the 1-month period that starts on the date on which the entity enters into BDH). A person appointed by the directors of the entity must act as chairperson of the meeting, but if no such person is appointed or is able to act, the creditors participating must choose one of their number to act as chairperson of the meeting. The person convening a meeting under clause 55(c) must do everything necessary that would otherwise be done by the person chairing a meeting. The chairperson or convenor does not have a casting vote. A quorum for a meeting of creditors is present if— 3 creditors who are entitled to vote, or their proxies, are present or have cast postal or electronic votes; or if the number of creditors entitled to vote does not exceed 3, the creditors who are entitled to vote, or their proxies, are present or have cast postal or electronic votes. A creditor may exercise the right to vote either by being present in person or by proxy. A proxy for a creditor is entitled to attend and be heard at a meeting of creditors as if the proxy were the creditor. A proxy must be appointed by notice in writing signed by the creditor, and the notice must state whether the appointment is for a particular meeting or a specified term not exceeding 12 months. No proxy is effective in relation to the meeting unless a copy of the notice of appointment is delivered to the entity not less than 2 working days before the start of the meeting. A creditor entitled to vote at a meeting of creditors held in accordance with clause 55(a), (b), or (c) may exercise the right to vote by casting a postal or an electronic vote in relation to a matter to be decided at that meeting. A creditor may cast a postal or an electronic vote on all or any of the matters to be voted on at the meeting by sending, by post or electronic means, information that indicates their vote to a person authorised to receive and count those votes in relation to that meeting, so as to reach that person not less than 2 working days before the start of the meeting or, if the meeting is held under clause 55(c), not later than the date named for the return of the voting information. The proposed arrangement that is voted on at a meeting must be the final proposed arrangement described in the notice sent to creditors under clause 9 (that is, the arrangement must not be varied). A body corporate that is a creditor may appoint a representative to attend a meeting of creditors on its behalf. A meeting of creditors may regulate its own procedure (except as provided in this Part and in the regulations (if any)). An irregularity or a defect in the proceedings at a meeting of creditors does not invalidate anything done by a meeting of creditors, unless the court orders otherwise. The court may, on the application of a creditor of the entity, make an order under subclause (1) if it is satisfied that substantial injustice would be caused if the order were not made. Section 391 provides for how a notice or other document must be sent to a creditor of an entity under this schedule (regardless of whether the entity is a company).  However, section 391(1) applies for the purposes of this schedule as if it also permitted a notice or other document that must or may be sent to a creditor (C) who is a natural person to be sent by email to an electronic address if— C has previously notified the entity that C uses that electronic address; and the entity has no reason to believe that the address is incorrect. Neither an entity becoming an entity in BDH nor anything in or effected by, or done under, this schedule— places any person in breach of, or otherwise in default under, an enactment, an instrument, a confidence, a trust, or any other rule of law or equity, or makes any person liable for a civil wrong; or may be used as evidence that an entity is unable to pay due debts or is otherwise insolvent; or entitles any person— to require the payment or performance of a liability not otherwise arising for payment or performance; or to exercise a right not otherwise becoming exercisable; or invalidates or discharges an instrument or any provision of an instrument; or releases a surety from a liability. If 1 or more rights of a person (A) cannot be enforced against an entity in BDH (B) for a period because of any provision in this schedule and B has a right under a contract, an agreement, or an arrangement against A for a new advance of money or credit, that right of B cannot be enforced during the same period. An entity that wishes to rely on a protection in Part 5 of this schedule in a proceeding has the burden of proving— that clauses 5 and 6 were complied with; and that notice of the proposed arrangement was sent under clause 9; and all other matters that are relevant to whether the protection applies to the entity. If a notice is delivered to the Registrar under clause 6, 19, 28, or 70, the Registrar must do either or both of the following: arrange for information relating to the notice to be registered on any register kept under this Act or any other enactment that the Registrar thinks fit (and the information may be registered regardless of whether the register is kept by the Registrar): otherwise make that information available to the public in any way the Registrar thinks fit (for example, publishing it on an Internet site). The power under subclause (1) includes, without limitation, the power to arrange for information to be registered in the New Zealand Business Number Register established under section 18 of the New Zealand Business Number Act 2016 (and, if the information is registered, it must be treated as being public primary business data for the purposes of that Act). This schedule does not prevent— an entity in BDH from becoming subject to a compromise under Part 14 of this Act; or an entity in BDH from becoming subject to an order under section 236; or a voluntary administration of an entity in BDH beginning under Part 15A of this Act; or a general security holder appointing a receiver for the whole, or substantially the whole, of the property of the entity; or the entity being put into liquidation. See, however, clause 18 (which provides for protections to cease). The board of the entity must, within 5 working days after an event referred to in subclause (1)﻿(a) to (e) occurs, deliver to the Registrar a notice that advises the Registrar of that event. If the board of an entity fails to comply with subclause (3), every director of the entity commits an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000.  If an arrangement is approved under clause 23, the court may, on an application, make any order that the court thinks fit with respect to the extent, if any, to which the arrangement will, if the entity is put into liquidation, continue in effect and be binding on the liquidator of the entity. If an arrangement is approved under clause 23 and the entity is subsequently put into liquidation, the court may, on an application, make any order that the court thinks fit with respect to the extent, if any, to which the arrangement will continue in effect and be binding on the liquidator of the entity. An application under— subclause (1) may only be made by— the entity; or a receiver appointed in relation to property of the entity; or with the leave of the court, any creditor or member of the entity: subclause (2) may only be made by— the liquidator; or a receiver appointed in relation to property of the entity; or with the leave of the court, any creditor or member of the entity. This clause applies if the Crown is a creditor of an entity that has entered into BDH. Nothing in section 65K of the Public Finance Act 1989 prevents the Crown from voting to approve an arrangement under this schedule (including an arrangement that would have the effect of deferring the payment of an amount). The schedule applies despite anything to the contrary in the Construction Contracts Act 2002. This clause applies to the extent that an arrangement approved under clause 23 involves 1 or more payments being made to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The arrangement must be treated as being an instalment arrangement under section 177B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 when the arrangement is approved under clause 23. The instalment arrangement ceases to be in force at the end of the protection period. The Tax Administration Act 1994 applies to the instalment arrangement— subject to the modifications, additions, or variations specified in the regulations; and with all other necessary modifications. This schedule amends the Corrections Act 2004. After section 139, insert: This section applies instead of section 139, while the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 is in force. Any hearing or application under any of sections 133 to 138 may be conducted or, as the case requires, determined with all or any of the interested persons participating in one of the following ways, rather than by being present in person: by video link; or if it is not reasonably practicable for the participant to attend in person and video link is unavailable or unable to be used, by audio link unless the hearing adjudicator or Visiting Justice considers that it is contrary to the interests of justice to use audio link. To avoid doubt, a motion to determine whether the use of audio link is contrary to the interests of justice may be made by the participant or the hearing adjudicator or Visiting Justice (as the case may be). In this section, audio link, in relation to an interested person’s appearance at any proceeding, means facilities that enable audio communication between the interested persons when some or all of them are not physically present at the place of hearing for all or part of the proceeding. This section is repealed on the date on which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. This Part amends the Coroners Act 2006. After section 21A, insert: This section— applies on and from the day on which this section comes into force; and ceases to apply immediately after the expiry of the 30-day period that starts on the date on which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. If this section applies, a preliminary inspection of a body performed under section 21A must also include the taking and testing of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs in any case where the deceased is suspected to have had COVID-19 at the time of death. This section is repealed immediately after the expiry of the 30-day period that starts on the date on which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. This Part amends the Courts (Remote Participation) Act 2010. After section 7, insert: In any circumstances in which a judicial officer or a Registrar would otherwise have determined under section 7 that AVL be used for the appearance of a participant in a civil proceeding, the judicial officer or Registrar may determine that AL be used instead of AVL if— the judicial officer or Registrar considers the criteria set out in section 5 (which applies as if the reference to AVL were a reference to AL) in deciding whether the use of AL is appropriate in the circumstances; and the judicial officer or Registrar determines that it is not contrary to the interests of justice to use AL instead of AVL. For the purposes of this section and section 8A, audio link or AL, in relation to a participant’s appearance at any proceeding, means facilities that enable audio communication between participants when some or all of them are not physically present at the place of hearing for all or part of the proceeding. This section is repealed when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. After section 8, insert: In any circumstances in which AVL must or may be used in accordance with section 8 for the appearance of a participant in a criminal procedural matter, the judicial officer or Registrar may determine that AL be used instead of AVL if— the judicial officer or Registrar considers the criteria set out in sections 5 and 6 (which apply as if the reference to AVL were a reference to AL) in deciding whether the use of AL is appropriate in the circumstances; and the defendant is not required to attend the hearing; and the judicial officer or Registrar determines that it is not contrary to the interests of justice to use AL instead of AVL. To avoid doubt, a motion to determine whether AL is contrary to the interests of justice may be made by the participant or the judicial officer or Registrar (as the case may be). This section is repealed when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. This Part amends the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006. After section 4, insert: The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. After section 26, insert: Provisions regarding COVID-19 are set out in Schedule 2. This section and Schedule 2 are repealed on the earlier of the following: 31 October 2021: a date set by the Governor-General by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Health with the agreement of the Minister of Justice. The Minister of Health may recommend the making of an Order in Council under subsection (2)﻿(b) only if the Minister is satisfied that it is unnecessary for this section to remain in force because— the effects of COVID-19 have diminished to such an extent that it is no longer necessary to rely on the changes made to the law by this section; or for any other reason arising since the commencement of this section, it is no longer necessary for this section to remain in force. After section 27 (as inserted by this Act), insert: This clause applies to clause 1 of Schedule 2. Any extension or shortening of time arising out of the application of clause 1 of Schedule 2 (as it read immediately after the commencement of this clause) and applied to proceedings continues to apply to the proceedings until they are concluded, whether or not clause 1 of Schedule 2 is repealed before the proceedings are concluded. In relation to a proceeding before it, a court may, in its discretion, extend or shorten the time appointed by rules of court or an enactment, or fixed by a court order, for doing an act or taking a step on the terms that the court thinks just if satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to do so because of circumstances relating to COVID-19. In this clause, court includes a tribunal. This schedule amends the Customs and Excise Act 2018. In Schedule 1, after clause 7(1), insert: Unless revoked earlier, the following orders continue in force until the close of 30 September 2021, at which time they are revoked: Customs Import Prohibition Order 2017: Customs Export Prohibition Order 2017. In Schedule 1, clause 7(2), replace “An” with “Any other”. This schedule amends the Resource Management Act 1991. After section 2AB, insert: In this section, document includes the following if they are required to be made available for inspection to the public, a class of members of the public, a person, or a class of persons, whether free of charge or at a reasonable cost: information of any kind; and public notices of any kind; and reports and evidence of any kind; and policy statements and plans of any kind, together with any changes or variations of those documents. This section applies if this Act requires a document to be made available for inspection in physical form to the public, a class of members of the public, a person, or a class of persons at a specified place such as council offices or a library. This section applies on and from 25 March 2020. The requirement referred to in subsection (2) is satisfied if the person responsible for making the document available—  makes it available in electronic form free of charge on an Internet site; and provides advice on how the document may be obtained or accessed. In addition, the person responsible for making a document available may— make it available for inspection; and upon request, make a physical copy of the document available for purchase at a reasonable cost.  This section is repealed on 31 October 2021. After section 39, insert: In this section,— audio link means a facility (such as a telephone facility) that enables audio communication between an authority and 1 or more persons with a right to be heard at a hearing audiovisual link means a facility that enables both audio and visual communication between an authority and 1 or more persons with a right to be heard at a hearing remote access facility means any of the following: audio link: audiovisual link: any other similar facility. For the purposes of section 39, an authority may direct that a hearing or part of a hearing may be conducted using 1 or more remote access facilities. A direction may be made under subsection (2)— on the initiative of the authority itself; or at the request of any person with a right to be heard at the hearing under section 40. An authority may make a direction under subsection (2) provided that the authority— considers it appropriate and fair to do so; and is satisfied that the necessary remote access facilities are available. If a hearing is conducted in full or in part using a remote access facility, the authority must,— if it is reasonably practicable to do so, enable access to the hearing by making the hearing available live and free of charge to the public, for example, on an Internet site; or as soon as practicable after the hearing closes, make available free of charge on its Internet site— an audio or a video recording of the hearing; or a written transcript of the hearing. This section does not apply— to a public hearing if the relevant authority is represented by 1 or more persons appearing in person at the hearing and 1 or more persons make submissions or give evidence by means of a remote access facility; or to a hearing to which section 47A of the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 applies. A hearing conducted in full or in part before 25 March 2020 using a remote access facility is deemed to comply with this section. This section applies on and from 25 March 2020. This section is repealed on 31 October 2021. This schedule amends the Fisheries Act 1996. After section 79(1), insert: However, the chief executive may cease the suspension if— the total amount of deemed values owed by the commercial fisher includes an amount demanded under section 76 during the period that begins on 20 April 2020 and ends on 30 September 2021; and the chief executive and the commercial fisher enter into an agreement (a repayment agreement) for repayment of the total amount owed within a new specified time limit. For the purpose of subsection (1), any amount for which there is a repayment agreement does not count towards the total amount of deemed values owed by a commercial fisher, unless there has been a failure to pay the amount within the time limit specified in the agreement. After section 79(2), insert: Subsection (2) also applies to the cessation of suspension of a fishing permit under subsection (1A). After section 79(6), insert: Subsections (1A), (1B), and (2A) and this subsection are repealed on 1 October 2021.

The Valuer-General may make a determination under subsection (4)﻿(a) only if satisfied that the territorial authority is unlikely or is not reasonably able to revise its district valuation roll so that it represents values current as at the date of the revaluation because of constraints on— the practicality of carrying out physical inspections; or the availability and reliability of market evidence or other information that the Valuer-General may require under section 10.

A date specified by an order— may be outside the period during which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 is in force; but must be no more than 6 weeks after the date that would otherwise have applied. A date may be specified by an order only if the order commences on or before the date that would otherwise have applied.  One or more further orders may be made under this section specifying a later date for a matter that has been the subject of an earlier order. An order must be made on the recommendation of the Minister. Before recommending the making of an order, the Minister— must be satisfied, on reasonable grounds, that it is necessary to ensure that the adverse effects of COVID-19, or measures related to COVID-19 such as restrictions on the movement of electors, do not deny electors a reasonable opportunity to cast a valid vote in the election or poll, or to nominate a candidate or accept nomination as a candidate for the election; and must have consulted every local authority and electoral officer that will be affected.  On commencement of an order,— a date specified in the order has effect in relation to— the election of members of the 1 or more local authorities, local boards, and community boards to which the order applies; or the poll to which the order applies; and this Act and any regulations made under it apply to the election or poll with any necessary modifications.

Section 73AB and this section are repealed and any orders made under section 73AB are revoked when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. Those repeals and the revocation of an order made under section 73AB do not affect the completion of anything done or yet to be done under the authority of such an order. Subsection (2) does not limit section 18 of the Interpretation Act 1999. After section 120, insert: This section applies— to the election underway to fill the current extraordinary vacancy in the Ōtorohanga ward of the Ōtorohanga District Council; and if a COVID-19 restricted movement period is in existence on the day this section comes into force (the existing COVID-19 period). Despite any other provision in this Act, the voting period for that election is a period of 22 and a half days starting at least 10 days after the last day of the existing COVID-19 period but is not to begin earlier than 28 May 2020. The voting period in subsection (2) may be changed by an Order in Council under section 73AB if 1 or more further COVID-19 restricted movement periods follow the existing COVID-19 period. The electoral officer for the Ōtorohanga District Council— must give public notice, as soon as practicable after this section comes into force, of the effect of subsection (2); and  must give public notice, as soon as practicable following the last day of the existing COVID-19 period, of the actual dates for the voting period and polling day (see also section 73AB(9) for the requirement for public notice to be given if dates are changed by Order in Council under that section); and may give any other notice they consider desirable. In this section, COVID-19 restricted movement period means a period during which the movement of electors for the election described in subsection (1)﻿(a) is restricted to an extent that may deny them a reasonable opportunity to cast a valid vote in the election, or premises on which functions related to that election will be undertaken are required to be closed, because of— an order or other restriction under section 70(1) of the Health Act 1956 that relates to COVID-19; or  an order under section 11 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. Despite section 120(1)﻿(a), if an extraordinary vacancy is to be filled by an election under section 117(1) before the end date, the chief executive of the relevant local authority may defer giving notice of the vacancy to the relevant electoral officer. Before doing so, the chief executive must consult with the electoral officer and must have regard to— the need to ensure the safety of voters and electoral officials, including in relation to public health considerations; and the extent to which the principles in section 4 can be met in the circumstances; and the need to ensure that the election process is free from corrupt or illegal practices; and the need to ensure that the election process is concluded in a timely and expeditious manner. If a chief executive decides to defer notifying an electoral officer under this section, the chief executive must— give public notice of the deferment as soon as practicable, and may give any other notice the chief executive considers desirable; and give the notice required by section 120(1)﻿(a) to the electoral officer— when the chief executive considers it is appropriate to do so having regard to the matters in subsection (2)﻿(a) to (d); but no later than as soon as practicable after the end date. In this section, end date means the date on which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. Sections 120A and 120B and this section are repealed when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked.

Despite section 93D(4), the local authority may adopt a consultation document that does not contain a report from the Auditor-General as required by that provision if— the proposed amendment of the long-term plan is necessary or desirable to support measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19 or its effects including, without limitation, by addressing the impacts and consequences of the outbreak for any aspect of the well-being of the community; and the local authority is satisfied that obtaining and including the report will prevent the authority from amending the long-term plan by 30 June 2020. This section is repealed on 1 August 2020. After section 94, insert: This section applies to a long-term plan that is amended using a special consultative procedure in which the local authority adopts a consultation document of a kind authorised by section 93DA(2).

However, the amended long-term plan must contain a statement— that the plan incorporates an amendment that has not been audited; and that includes the reasons why the amendment was not audited. The local authority must include a statement under subsection (3) in the amended long-term plan immediately before the Auditor-General’s report under section 94(1).

If this subsection applies, the original licence, unless it is sooner surrendered or revoked, continues as if it had not expired on the original expiry date and must be treated as continuing in force until the earlier of the following: the date on which the licence holder is notified of the determination made on their application for a new licence: the date that is 12 months after the original expiry date. Subsection (5) applies if the period for which a licence (an original licence) was issued expires on a date during the period commencing on 25 March 2020 and ending on 25 September 2020 (the original expiry date). If this subsection applies, the original licence, unless it is sooner surrendered or revoked, does not expire on its original expiry date but must be treated as continuing in force until the date that is 4 months after the original expiry date (the extended expiry date). If the holder of a licence that continues in force under subsection (5) (an extended licence) applies for a new licence to replace the extended licence before the extended expiry date, the extended licence, unless it is sooner surrendered or revoked, does not expire on the extended expiry date but must be treated as continuing in force until the earlier of the following: the date on which the licence holder is notified of the determination made on their application for a new licence: the date that is 12 months after the original expiry date. While a licence is treated as continuing in force under subsection (3), (5), or (6),— any endorsement on the licence, and any condition to which that endorsement is subject, continues to apply unless sooner revoked; and any condition to which the licence is subject continues to apply. In this section, licence means— any dealer’s licence; or a firearms licence (other than a licence referred to in section 25(2) granted to a visitor to New Zealand).

This Part applies on and from 25 March 2020 as if it were in force on and from that date. In this Part,— COVID-19 response period means the period starting on 25 March 2020 and ending 3 months after the date on which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked COVID-19 response work means work that occurs (all or in part) during the COVID-19 response period COVID-19 response worker has the meaning given in section 30JD parental leave does not include partner’s leave. This section applies to a person if— the person is entitled to parental leave; and the person is— an employee who has agreed with their employer to temporarily return to work to respond to circumstances related to the outbreak of COVID-19; or a self-employed person who wants to temporarily return to work to respond to circumstances related to the outbreak of COVID-19. A person to whom this section applies is a COVID-19 response worker if, in circumstances related to the outbreak of COVID-19,— their role cannot reasonably be filled by another person (because of the person’s skill, qualifications, or experience); or there is higher demand than usual for workers doing their role. A day of COVID-19 response work is not a keeping-in-touch day. This section applies to a COVID-19 response worker who has not yet received all the parental leave payments to which the worker is entitled under— section 71D; and section 71J (as that section applies to a COVID-19 response worker in accordance with section 30JK); and section 71L (as that section applies to a COVID-19 response worker in accordance with section 30JI). The worker is entitled to parental leave payments if— the worker has applied for parental leave payments under section 71I; and the worker temporarily returns to work for COVID-19 response work; and the worker applies for payment in accordance with subsection (5). The temporary return— may not be for longer than 12 weeks (unless a Labour Inspector determines that a longer period is reasonable under section 30JS); and must be in 1 continuous period (unless a Labour Inspector determines that more than 1 period is reasonable under section 30JS). The worker may apply to the department for parental leave payments to be paid for the period for which the worker resumes parental leave after finishing COVID-19 response work. The application must include— the date on which the worker will resume (or has resumed) parental leave; and confirmation that the worker— is a COVID-19 response worker; and is applying in relation to COVID-19 response work; and has not yet received all the parental leave payments referred to in subsection (1). A COVID-19 response worker must notify the department under this section and not under section 71U(1) if, during the period for which the worker is receiving a parental leave payment or preterm baby payment, the worker temporarily returns to work for COVID-19 response work. The worker may notify at the same time as the worker applies under section 30JF for payments to resume after the temporary return to work. This section overrides the obligation in section 71U(1) for the worker to notify the department of the worker’s return to work. The department must not pay parental leave payments or preterm baby payments to a COVID-19 response worker in relation to the period of COVID-19 response work. Any payments received by the worker in respect of that period are recoverable under section 71X as an overpayment. Section 71L(1) does not apply to a COVID-19 response worker and this section applies instead. A parental leave payment is payable to the worker in respect of a child for a period that ends on the earlier of— the date on which the worker has received all the parental leave payments to which the worker is entitled under section 71D and section 71J (as that section applies to a COVID-19 response worker in accordance with section 30JK); and the date on which the worker permanently returns to work as an employee or a self-employed person (as notified under section 71U). The requirement in section 9 that primary carer leave be taken in 1 continuous period does not apply to a COVID-19 response worker and instead there may be more than 1 period of primary carer leave. However, the periods must not together exceed the maximum period allowed under section 9. This Act applies accordingly so that references to a period of leave must be read as references to periods. The requirement in sections 71DA(2) and 71J that payment be made for 1 continuous period does not apply to a COVID-19 response worker and instead there may be more than 1 period. However, the periods must not together exceed the maximum period for which payments are payable under section 71DA(2) or 71J. This Act applies accordingly so that references to a period during which payments are payable must be read as references to periods. For the purposes of section 27, the applicable end date for a COVID-19 response worker’s extended leave means,— in relation to employees who meet the 6-month employment test, the date on which the worker has had 6 months of parental leave; and in relation to employees who meet the 12-month employment test, the date on which the worker has had 12 months of parental leave. This section applies (and section 71DA(5A)﻿(a)﻿(i) does not) to a COVID-19 response worker who is entitled to a preterm baby payment under section 71DA. If the worker temporarily returns to work for COVID-19 response work, the department must not pay preterm baby payments to the worker in relation to the period of COVID-19 response work. Any preterm baby payments received by the worker in respect of that period are recoverable under section 71X as an overpayment. However, if the return to work finishes before the end of the preterm baby payment period, the worker’s preterm baby payments— resume on the date on which the worker resumes parental leave; and continue until the end of what would have been the 36th week of pregnancy had the child not been born prematurely. A temporary return to work by a COVID-19 response worker for COVID-19 response work is not a return to work for the purposes of section 42(2)﻿(c). Section 21(2) of the Holidays Act 2003 must be used to calculate an employee’s holiday pay entitlements in respect of any portion of annual holidays that relates to a period of COVID-19 response work. Section 6 does not apply to a COVID-19 response worker (in respect of a subsequent child) if a period of 6 months has elapsed after the end of the period for which a COVID-19 response worker would have taken parental leave (but for the COVID-19 response work). Section 71F(a) does not apply to a COVID-19 response worker if a period of 6 months has elapsed after the end of the period for which the worker would have received a parental leave payment (but for the COVID-19 response work). Regulations may be made under section 73 prescribing the information that must be given in, or the documents that must be attached to,— an application under section 30JF by a COVID-19 response worker for parental leave payments: a notice relating to a return to work by a COVID-19 response worker. Section 71IA applies to an application made under section 30JF as if an irregularity includes— an application being made after the COVID-19 response worker has begun COVID-19 response work; and an application under section 71I being made at the same time as an application under section 30JF; and an application being made after the COVID-19 response worker has begun parental leave again after completing COVID-19 response work; and an application being made after the commencement of this section and in respect of COVID-19 response work that occurred at any time during the COVID-19 response period (whether the work was performed before or after the commencement of this section); and an application being made after a notice was given in accordance with section 71U (and the department may treat the notice as sufficient to comply with section 30JG). A Labour Inspector may determine, for the purposes of an application made under section 30JF,— that a temporary return to work for longer than 12 weeks is a temporary return to work and is a reasonable period in the circumstances; or that more than 1 temporary return to work is reasonable in the circumstances and is a temporary return to work, as long as the returns do not together exceed a period of 12 weeks (or any other period determined under paragraph (a)). A Labour Inspector must, as soon as practicable after making a determination, serve a copy on the worker and any employer. The consequences of a determination are that it is prima facie evidence of the matter determined. Sections 70C and 70E apply to a determination under this section in the same way as those sections apply to a determination under section 70A.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0013/latest/whole.html

2021-04-08T14:54:04,COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. This Act is the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020. This Act comes into force on the day after the date on which it receives the Royal assent. This Act provides processes for an entity affected by COVID-19— to, in some circumstances, use electronic means for doing things if its constitution or rules would otherwise prevent this; and to modify certain requirements or restrictions in its constitution or rules if it is not reasonably practicable to comply with them. The processes are in Part 2. Modifications made to constitutions or rules under section 13 are temporary. However, an entity may make lasting amendments to its constitution or rules through electronic voting (see sections 10 and 11). This Act also provides, in Part 3,— powers for responsible Registrars and Ministers to exempt classes of persons from certain provisions of specified enactments; and powers for the Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court to grant relief from compliance with terms of certain orders made under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993.

This section defines,— for the purposes of Part 2, in relation to an entity, the responsible Registrar or agency: for the purposes of Part 3, in relation to specified enactments, the responsible Registrar or Minister. Responsible Registrar or agency,— if the entity is listed in any of section 4(1)﻿(b) to (e) or (g) to (j), means the Registrar who acts under the specified Act under which the entity is registered or incorporated: if the entity is listed in any of section 4(1)﻿(a) or (m) to (o), means the Chief Registrar of the Māori Land Court: if the entity is a Māori association or a Māori Trust Board, means the chief executive of Te Puni Kōkiri: if the entity is a mandated iwi organisation, means Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited.

There is no responsible Registrar or agency in relation to— a firm (within the meaning of the Partnership Law Act 2019): a post-settlement governance entity of a type not listed in section 4(1). For the purposes of the powers to grant exemptions under Part 3 in relation to the specified Acts (and the specified enactments made under them), responsible Registrar or Minister means,— in relation to each specified Act listed in section 5(a) to (g), the Registrar as defined in the specified Act: in relation to the Partnership Law Act 2019, the Registrar of Companies: in relation to the Maori Community Development Act 1962, the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, and Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993, the Minister for Māori Development: in relation to the Maori Fisheries Act 2004, the Minister of Fisheries.

This Act binds the Crown. Each of sections 10 and 13 applies in relation to an entity— until the close of 30 November 2020; and if its application is extended by an Order in Council made under section 42 in relation to the type of entity, for the further period. No vote may be taken or received (wholly or partly) by electronic means in reliance on section 10, and no other part of a voting process may be done in reliance on that section, unless a majority of the entity’s governing officers (or the entity’s governing officer, if it has only 1)— believe, on reasonable grounds, that the provisions in the entity’s constitution or rules that relate to the integrity of the voting process— are or will be substantively complied with; and will not be substantively compromised as a consequence of the vote; and sign a certificate certifying as to their beliefs under paragraph (a) and recording the reasons why, and keep that certificate with the entity’s records. In forming their beliefs under subsection (1)﻿(a), the matters to which the governing officers must have regard include— whether, if a vote or other part of a voting process is done (wholly or partly) by electronic means, all persons who are entitled to vote will have a reasonable opportunity to vote and participate in the process; and whether any person who is entitled to vote may suffer a material detriment. The conditions that permit a matter to be done in reliance on section 10 are as follows: to the extent that doing the matter by electronic means relates to— having information in electronic form (instead of in writing), section 222 of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017 must be complied with: recording information in electronic form (instead of in writing), section 223 of that Act must be complied with: giving information in electronic form (instead of giving it in writing), section 224 of that Act must be complied with: an electronic signature (instead of a non-electronic signature), section 226 or 227 of that Act must be complied with: retaining an electronic form of information (instead of retaining the information in paper or any other non-electronic form), section 229 of that Act must be complied with: providing or producing information in electronic form (instead of providing or producing the information in paper or any other non-electronic form), section 232 of that Act must be complied with: providing access to information in electronic form (instead of providing access to the information in paper or any other non-electronic form), section 234 of that Act must be complied with; and the entity must keep a record of— the electronic communications used to do the matter (if any); and the reasons for the belief of the majority of its governing officers referred to in section 10(1)﻿(b) (and section 10(1)﻿(a), if relevant); and the entity must make reasonable efforts to notify all members and governing officers of the matter for which section 10 has been, or will be, relied on; and the entity must give to the responsible Registrar or agency a written notice that— identifies the matter for which section 10 has been, or will be, relied on; and contains, or is accompanied by, a copy of the record referred to in paragraph (b)﻿(ii). For the purposes of meeting any conditions in subsection (1)﻿(a) to (c), an entity may treat a person as having consented to use, provide, accept, or receive information and electronic signatures by email if— the person has previously notified the entity of an electronic address that the person uses; and the entity has no reason to believe that the address is incorrect; and the entity believes, on reasonable grounds, that the use of email to give the information or signature will not materially disadvantage the person; and the person has not expressly told the entity that the person wants to use, provide, accept, or receive the particular information or signature by some means other than by email. If subsection (1)﻿(c) or (d) is not complied with before the matter is done, it must be complied with as soon as reasonably practicable after the matter is done. If there is more than 1 responsible Registrar or agency, the entity must give the notice under subsection (1)﻿(d) to each of them. Subsection (1)﻿(d) does not apply to a firm (within the meaning of the Partnership Law Act 2019) or to a post-settlement governance entity of a type not listed in section 4(1). Section 13 allows modifications relating to the following: calling or holding meetings (including procedures at meetings): a method or form of voting: giving or receiving information: making or keeping new records: a method or form of dispute resolution: a method or form of disciplinary procedure: a waiver, suspension, deferral, or reduction of fees or other amounts payable by members of the entity to the entity: a deferral of auditing, assurance, or financial reporting or review requirements: use of electronic means to do any matter listed in section 10(2): other procedural or administrative processes. However, the list in subsection (1) is subject to regulations made under section 41(1)﻿(a)﻿(i) or (iii) (which may restrict, or add to, the list). If there is any inconsistency between this section and section 15(a) to (j), that section prevails. Section 13 does not allow modifications that relate to the following: the purpose or objects of the entity: the powers of the entity (other than a procedural or an administrative power): the sale, transfer, or other disposition of real or personal property: voting rights or rights to a dividend or other distribution: the number, or need, for a quorum: rights of access to courts, tribunals, or arbitral tribunals: the duties of the governing body or governing officers (other than a procedural or an administrative duty): fees or other payments (other than a waiver, suspension, deferral, or reduction of fees or other amounts payable by members of the entity to the entity): an alteration or addition made to the constitution or rules by an order of a court: any matter if the modification to that matter has a material detrimental effect (direct or indirect) on the substantive rights or powers of any creditor or other person: any matter that is prescribed by regulations made under section 41(1)﻿(a)﻿(ii): any other matter that is not listed in section 14. This section applies to the extent that a modification made under section 13 relates to either of the following: omitting to do a required act by a due date that is before the date on which the modification is made: an act done in an attempt to do an act required to be done by a due date that is before the date on which the modification is made. The modification is treated as validly made on or immediately before the due date if— the due date is no earlier than 21 March 2020; and the modification is made by the entity no later than 3 months after the commencement date. To the extent that the modification relates to a due date earlier than 21 March 2020, the modification is of no effect. A modification made under section 13 in the initial period must have an express expiry date that is no later than the end of the initial period. However, subsection (3) applies if— a modification made by an entity is in force immediately before the end of the initial period; and an Order in Council is made under section 42(1)﻿(b) for a further period in relation to the type of entity. The modification does not expire at the end of the initial period but is treated as having an expiry date that is the end of the further period. Subsection (3) does not apply if the modification expressly states that it will not apply in any further period. A modification made by an entity under section 13 in the further period (if any) must have an express expiry date that is no later than the end of the further period. An entity that relies on section 13 must do all of the following: keep a written record of— the notice of the modification; and its reasons as to how the requirements of section 13 were satisfied in respect of the modification; and the reasons for the beliefs of the majority of its governing officers referred to in section 13(2)﻿(c), (e), and (f); and as soon as practicable after making the modification, make reasonable efforts to notify all members and governing officers of the entity of the modification; and as soon as practicable after making the modification, give to the responsible Registrar or agency a written notice that— states that the entity is relying on section 13 of this Act; and contains, or is accompanied by, a copy of the written record referred to in paragraph (a); and contains, or is accompanied by, a certificate by a governing officer of the entity certifying that, in making the modification, all requirements of this Act were complied with. If there is more than 1 responsible Registrar or agency, the entity must give the notice under subsection (1)﻿(c) to each of them. Subsection (1)﻿(c) does not apply to a firm (within the meaning of the Partnership Law Act 2019) or to a post-settlement governance entity of a type not listed in section 4(1). This section applies if,— because of a restriction or requirement in an entity’s constitution or rules, 1 or more matters in subsection (2) may not be done by electronic means, or a majority of an entity’s governing officers, in good faith, believe that there is uncertainty as to whether the matter may be done by electronic means; and the majority of the entity’s governing officers believe, in good faith, that it is not reasonably practicable to do the matter by non-electronic means. The matters relate to a modification under section 13 and are— making and signing the written notice of modification: recording the beliefs under section 13(2)﻿(c), (e), and (f): compliance with any condition in section 18. If this section applies,— the matter may be done, wholly or partly, by electronic means; and if done by electronic means, the matter has legal effect to the same extent as if it had been done by non-electronic means in accordance with the constitution or rules. However, subsection (3) is subject to the conditions in section 12(1)﻿(a) and (b)﻿(i) being complied with (and section 12 applies for this purpose with the necessary modifications). In order to do the matter by electronic means, it is not necessary to comply with a paper-based format requirement within the meaning of section 225 of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017. This section does not affect any legal requirement to the extent that the requirement relates to the content of information. A vote may not be taken or received (wholly or partly) in reliance on a modification made under section 13 to a method or form of voting if the vote relates to any of the following matters (and, to the extent they are purportedly voted on in reliance on the modification, the vote is of no effect): an amendment to an entity’s constitution or rules (other than an amendment described in subsection (2)); or any matter listed in section 15. Subsection (1)﻿(a) does not prevent a vote being taken or received (wholly or partly) in reliance on a modification made under section 13 to a method or form of voting if the amendment expires in accordance with section 17 (which applies with all necessary modifications as if the amendment were a modification referred to in that section). An entity that desires to vary a modification made under section 13 may do so only under that section (with this Part applying with all necessary modifications). A modification made by an entity under section 13 may be revoked by a notice in writing that is signed by the majority of the entity’s governing officers (or signed by its governing officer, if it has only 1). An entity must comply with section 18 (with all necessary modifications), other than section 18(1)﻿(a)﻿(ii) and (iii) and (c)﻿(i), in relation to a revocation. This section applies when a responsible Registrar or agency receives a written notice under this Part. A Registrar receiving the notice— must arrange for particulars about the notice (including particulars about information contained in, or accompanying, the notice) to be registered on the relevant register; and may otherwise make the particulars available to the public in any way the Registrar thinks fit (for example, by publishing them on an Internet site). An agency receiving the notice must make particulars about the notice (including particulars about information contained in, or accompanying, the notice) available to the public, but may do so in any way the agency thinks fit (for example, by publishing them on an Internet site). On and from the end of the relevant period, the obligations that an entity has under other enactments in relation to the keeping of entity records apply to all written records and electronic communications made by or under this Part. The purpose of this Part is to enable the modification or relaxation of described procedural or administrative matters in specified enactments and certain orders that— are unduly onerous or burdensome because of the effects of COVID-19; or may not be reasonably capable of being complied with, or complied with fully, because of the effects of COVID-19. Every power to grant exemptions under section 26, and the power under section 30, may only be exercised— until the close of 30 November 2020; and if extended by an Order in Council made under section 42, during the further period. A responsible Registrar or Minister must not grant an exemption under this Part unless— the responsible Registrar or Minister is satisfied that— granting the exemption is necessary or desirable for the purpose of this Part as set out in section 24; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemption; and the exemption is the most appropriate way of addressing those matters at the time; and the responsible Registrar or Minister has complied with section 28. Additionally, if the exemption relates to rules made by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited under section 54 of the Maori Fisheries Act 2004, the Minister of Fisheries (as the responsible Registrar or Minister) must have consulted Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Limited on the proposed exemption. For the purposes of section 27(1)﻿(b), the responsible Registrar or Minister must— make available a document referred to in subsection (2) to— the persons or representatives of persons that the responsible Registrar or Minister considers appropriate given the proposed effect of the exemption; or the public generally; and invite those persons to make written comments on the document; and give those persons 3 working days from the making of the invitation within which to make their comments to the responsible Registrar or Minister (or any longer time allowed by the responsible Registrar or Minister); and have regard to those comments that are received within the 3-working-day period (or within the longer time allowed by the responsible Registrar or Minister). The document must include— an explanation of what the exemption is intended to achieve; and a description of the proposed effect of the exemption; and an explanation of why the responsible Registrar or Minister considers that the exemption is necessary or desirable for the purpose of this Part and why the exemption is appropriate. Subsection (1) and section 27(1)﻿(b) do not apply, or do not apply to a person or class of persons, if the responsible Registrar or Minister is satisfied that— engagement is not reasonably practical in the circumstances; or the urgency of the situation requires that the exemption be made as soon as practicable without that engagement; or the exemption benefits the persons referred to in subsection (1)﻿(a)﻿(i) and does not materially detrimentally affect any person; or in the circumstances, engagement is clearly disproportionate to the nature, size, significance, and effect of the exemption. If subsection (3) is relied on, the responsible Registrar or Minister’s reasons for relying on that subsection must be published together with the exemption. For the purposes of this Act, the provisions of specified enactments for which exemptions may be granted are provisions that relate to any of the following matters: calling or holding meetings (including procedures at meetings): a method or form of voting: giving or receiving information: making or keeping new records: rights to inspect or access information or records: a method or form of dispute resolution (excluding rights of access to courts, tribunals, or arbitral tribunals): a method or form of disciplinary procedures: auditing, assurance, or financial reporting or review requirements: any other matter specified by regulations made under section 41(1)﻿(b)﻿(i). However, the list in subsection (1) is subject to regulations made under section 41(1)﻿(b)﻿(ii) (which may restrict the list) and subsections (3) to (5). No exemption may be granted that results in a process for dispute resolution or a disciplinary procedure that is contrary to the rules of natural justice. No exemption may dilute voting rights. No exemption may dilute the number or need for a quorum. A responsible Registrar or Minister may grant an exemption under this Part in respect of past acts or omissions. However, no exemption may relate to an act or omission that occurred before 21 March 2020. An exemption granted under this Part in relation to a requirement that relates to a period of time (for example, a requirement to prepare and lodge financial statements for an accounting period) may, if the responsible Registrar or Minister thinks fit, apply to a period that commenced before the exemption is granted (including a period that ended before the exemption is granted) if— the exemption is granted before the requirement would otherwise need to be complied with under the specified enactment; or section 31 applies. An exemption granted in the initial period may continue in force until the end of the initial period (and, at that point, the exemption must be treated as having been revoked unless it is sooner revoked or expires, or subsection (3) applies). Subsection (3) applies if— an exemption is in force immediately before the end of the initial period; and an Order in Council is made under section 42 for a further period in relation to section 26 and the specified enactment to which the exemption relates. The exemption is not revoked at the close of the initial period but continues in force until the end of the further period (unless it is sooner revoked or expires). Subsection (3) does not apply if the exemption expressly states that it will not apply in any further period. An exemption granted in the further period (if any) may continue in force until the end of the further period (and, at that point, the exemption must be treated as having been revoked unless it is sooner revoked or expires). The breach of a term or condition of an exemption granted under this Part is a breach of the provision to which the exemption relates (unless the terms of the exemption otherwise provide). The responsible Registrar or Minister must, before granting an exemption, consider— whether the exemption should be a legislative instrument for the purposes of the Legislation Act 2012 that is drafted by the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) under that Act; and whether, accordingly, a notice should be given under section 36. In performing that duty, the responsible Registrar or Minister must have regard to— the nature of the exemption; and how significant the exemption is; and the number and nature of the persons to whom the exemption will apply; and the consequences of a failure to comply with a condition of the exemption; and the complexity of the exemption; and the purposes of the Legislation Act 2012; and any other relevant matters. An exemption under this Part is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the Legislation Act 2012 (and must be drafted by the PCO) only if, before the exemption is issued, the responsible Registrar or Minister notifies the Chief Parliamentary Counsel in writing that the exemption will be a legislative instrument. All other exemptions under this Part are not legislative instruments. Every exemption under this Part— is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Legislation Act 2012; and must be presented to the House of Representatives under section 41 of that Act. This section applies to exemptions granted under this Part that are not legislative instruments (see section 36). The exemption must be published on an Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the relevant Registrar or the government department that administers the specified enactment to which the exemption relates. A responsible Registrar or Minister’s reasons for granting an exemption under this Part (including why the exemption is appropriate) must be published together with the exemption. A responsible Registrar or Minister may vary or revoke an exemption in the same way as the responsible Registrar or Minister may grant the exemption (with the provisions relating to the granting of the exemption applying with all necessary modifications). However, a notice must be given under section 36 for a variation or revocation of an exemption that is a legislative instrument. Sections 10, 13, 26, 30, 41, and 42 are repealed on 1 April 2021. The rest of this Act is repealed on the close of 31 May 2022.

In the application of subparts IC and IP to the making available by a person, to another member of a group of companies, of an amount of available tax loss arising for the person under subsection (7),— the amount of available tax loss that exceeds the person’s initial taxable income is a tax loss for the taxable income year for the purposes of section IC 1 (Company A making tax loss available to company B): the commonality period referred to in section IC 6 (Common ownership for period) is the period consisting of the offset years: the requirements in section IP 4(2)﻿(d) and (4) and section IP 5 (which relate to breaches of continuity or commonality requirements) are not applied: the requirements in section IP 4(2)﻿(a), (ab), and (c) (Breach in income year in which tax loss component arises) are replaced by the requirements given by subsection (9).

The discretionary power to make a variation under section 6I supplements the powers of the Commissioner under the provisions of this Act.

A member of the public may still request a copy of the minutes in accordance with section 51(2) (and, subject to section 51(3), that copy must be provided by post). This section is repealed when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. This Part amends the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. After section 144, insert: The provisions of Schedule 5 have effect according to their terms. After Schedule 4, insert the Schedule 5 set out in the Schedule of this Act. In this schedule,— commencement date means the date on which this schedule comes into force initial period means the period described in clause 3(1)﻿(a). This schedule applies— to a tenancy to which this Act applies; and despite any other provision in this Act or any other enactment, or any rule of law or agreement. Clauses 4 to 8 apply— for a period of 3 months starting on the commencement date: if extended by Order in Council under subclause (2), for a further period of up to 3 months starting immediately after the conclusion of the initial period. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister, extend the application of clauses 4 to 8 for a period of up to 3 months after the initial period. The period may be extended under this clause only once. The Minister must not recommend the making of an order under subclause (2) unless the Minister is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to support measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19 or its effects. The Minister’s reasons for making the recommendation (including why the order is necessary or desirable) must be published together with the order.  An order made under this clause must be notified in the Gazette at least 7 days before the conclusion of the initial period.  The order is a legislative instrument and a disallowable instrument for the purposes of the Legislation Act 2012 and must be presented to the House of Representatives under section 41 of that Act. No tenancy terminates, and every fixed-term tenancy that expires continues under section 60A(1) as a periodic tenancy, unless— the tenancy is terminated, or the tenancy is not continued as a periodic tenancy, on the initiative of the tenant in accordance with a provision of this Act (including by a notice given, or an application made, before, on, or after the commencement date); or the tenancy is terminated with the written agreement of the landlord and the tenant or section 60A(2)﻿(a) applies; or the termination is in accordance with section 50A, 55, 59A, 61, 66U(1)﻿(a) or (b), or 66W (but see subclause (3)); or the termination is in accordance with clause 5 (anti-social behaviour). Subclause (1) applies to a fixed-term tenancy of 90 days or less as if it were a fixed-term tenancy of more than 90 days. For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(c),— section 55(1)﻿(a) must be treated as if it referred to rent being at least 60 days in arrear (rather than at least 21 days in arrear): on an application referred to in section 55(1)﻿(a), the Tribunal may refuse to make an order, if— satisfied that the tenant is making reasonable endeavours to pay rent; and after balancing the interests of the tenant and landlord, the Tribunal considers that an order terminating the tenancy is not justified: a landlord seeking to terminate a boarding house tenancy under section 66U(1)﻿(a) or (b)﻿(ii) must give at least 28 days’ notice: a landlord seeking to terminate a boarding house tenancy under section 66U(1)﻿(b)﻿(i) must apply to the Tribunal for an order terminating the tenancy and, for the purposes of the application, section 55 applies (as modified by paragraphs (a) and (b)) as if the boarding house tenancy were not a boarding house tenancy. Subclause (3) does not apply for the purposes of clause 9 or 10. A landlord must not give a notice or make an application for termination of a tenancy except in accordance with a provision specified in subclause (1)﻿(c) or in accordance with clause 5. A landlord may apply to the Tribunal for an order terminating a tenancy on the ground of anti-social behaviour. The Tribunal may make the order if satisfied that the tenant, or a person in the premises with the tenant’s permission (other than the landlord or a person acting on the landlord’s behalf or with the landlord’s authority), has engaged in anti-social behaviour in connection with the tenancy. However, the Tribunal must not make the order if satisfied that— doing so would be unfair because of the circumstances in which the behaviour occurred or the impact that terminating the tenancy would have on the tenant; or in making the application, the landlord was motivated wholly or partly by the exercise or proposed exercise by the tenant of any right, power, authority, or remedy conferred on the tenant by the tenancy agreement or by this or any other Act or any complaint by the tenant against the landlord relating to the tenancy (unless the Tribunal is satisfied that the purported exercise or the complaint was or would be vexatious or frivolous to such an extent that the landlord was justified in making the application). In deciding whether to make an order under subclause (2), the Tribunal must take into account the impact that terminating the tenancy would have on the tenant. For the purposes of subclause (2), if a tenant is in the premises at the time that the other person engages in the anti-social behaviour, the tenant is presumed to have permitted the person to be in the premises unless the tenant proves that they took all reasonable steps to prevent the person from entering the premises or to eject the person from the premises. In this clause, anti-social behaviour means— harassment; or any intentional act that reasonably causes significant alarm, distress, or nuisance. A landlord commits an unlawful act if they give or purport to give a notice to terminate to the tenant or apply or purport to apply to the Tribunal for an order terminating the tenancy knowing that they are not entitled, under this Act,—  to give the notice; or to make the application. The maximum amount that a person may be ordered to pay under section 109 for the unlawful act is $6,500. Subclause (2) applies if,— before the commencement date, a tenant gave a notice to terminate a tenancy under a provision of this Act (a termination notice); and the tenancy has not yet terminated under the termination notice. The tenant may give the landlord written notice of their intention to remain in the premises, in which case the tenancy continues as if the termination notice had not been given. Subclause (4) applies if,— before the commencement date, a tenant made an application for and was granted an order providing for the termination of the tenancy; and the tenancy has not yet terminated under that order. The tenant may give the landlord written notice of their intention to remain in the premises, in which case the order is of no effect and the tenancy continues as if the order had not been made. Subclause (6) applies if,— before the commencement date, the tenant and the landlord agreed to terminate the tenancy with effect on or after the commencement date; and the tenancy has not yet terminated under that agreement. The tenant may give the landlord written notice of their intention to remain in the premises, in which case the agreement is of no effect and the tenancy continues as if the agreement had not been entered into. If, as a consequence of a notice under clause 7(2), (4), or (6), vacant possession of a premises cannot be delivered up to an incoming or prospective tenant,— the incoming or prospective tenant has no right to occupy the premises; and the landlord and the incoming or prospective tenant are released from any obligations owed to each other in relation to the tenancy (except as provided in subclause (2)). A landlord that receives a notice under clause 7(2), (4), or (6) must, as soon as practicable, advise any incoming or prospective tenant that the premises are no longer available. Subclause (2) applies if,— before the commencement date, a landlord gave notice to terminate a tenancy, or notice under section 60A(2)﻿(b) of the landlord’s intention not to continue with the tenancy; and the notice was given under a provision of the Act other than a provision specified in clause 4(1)﻿(c); and on the commencement date, the tenant is still residing in the premises. The notice is of no effect. Subclause (2) applies if,— before the commencement date, the Tribunal made an order terminating a tenancy with effect on or after the commencement date (whether or not the order also covers any other matter); and the order was made other than under a provision specified in clause 4(1)﻿(c); and on the commencement date, the tenant is still residing in the premises. The order is suspended until the 15th day after the end of the period in which clauses 4 to 8 apply. The order takes effect on that date— as if the order had provided for the termination to occur on that date; and with any other necessary modifications. This clause does not limit clause 4 (for example, the parties could agree to terminate the tenancy rather than wait for the order to take effect). Clauses 12 and 13 apply for a period of 6 months starting on the commencement date. The rent payable in respect of any tenancy may not be increased. If a notice to increase rent was given in accordance with this Act before the commencement date, and the rent increase has not taken effect before the commencement date, the notice is of no effect. A landlord commits an unlawful act if they increase or purport to increase rent knowing they are not entitled under this Act to increase the rent. The maximum amount that a person may be ordered to pay under section 109 for the unlawful act is $6,500. Clause 15 applies for a period of 6 months starting on the commencement date. The Tribunal may conduct its proceedings (whether they relate to this schedule or otherwise) as it sees fit, including on the papers. If the Tribunal decides to hold a hearing, it may hold the hearing in any manner that the Tribunal thinks fit (including by telephone or video conference).",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2020/0009/latest/whole.html

Subsections (3) to (7) apply to regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1). The regulations may— provide for different periods of suspension for different classes of people and different classes and types of visa; and without limiting the generality of the manner in which persons may be classified, classify persons by reference to all or any of the following: the country or place from which they are travelling or have travelled (whether it be their original or an intermediate point of departure): whether or not they hold, or are required to hold, any particular type of travel or immigration documentation, by whomever issued: any other type of visa that they hold or have applied for: any other factor that is relevant to containing or mitigating the outbreak of COVID-19 or its effects; and without limiting the generality of the manner in which classes or types of visa may be classified, classify classes or types of visa by reference to all or any of the following: in the case of a temporary visa, the name and description of the visa as provided in the immigration instructions: whether an application for the visa is required by or under the regulations to be made online: any specific information or evidence that is required by the regulations or the immigration instructions to be provided in order for an application for the visa to be made. The Minister must not recommend the making of the regulations unless satisfied that doing so is reasonably necessary to manage the effects, or deal with the consequences, of— the outbreak of COVID-19; or measures taken under this Act or any other enactment to contain or mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19 or its effects; or any other measures (whether in New Zealand or elsewhere) to contain or mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19 or its effects. A suspension may be for a period not exceeding 3 months specified in the regulations. If the requirements of subsection (4) continue to be met, regulations may from time to time be made under section 400 that extend the period of a suspension already in force for a further period not exceeding 3 months. An extension referred to in subsection (6) may only be made before the end of the period to be extended. This section is repealed immediately after the expiry of the 12-month period that starts on the date on which the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Act 2020 comes into force. If the making of an application for a class or type of visa by all persons or by any class of persons is suspended by regulations made for the purposes of section 401A, then, despite any other provision of this Act (or any immigration instruction),— no person or, as the case may be, no person in the relevant class of persons may apply for a visa of that class or type; and if a person purports to apply for a visa contrary to paragraph (a), the application is deemed not to have been made. If the ability of all persons or of any class of persons to submit an expression of interest in relation to a class or type of visa is suspended by regulations made for the purposes of section 401A, then, despite any other provision of this Act (or any immigration instruction),— no person or, as the case may be, no person in the relevant class of persons may submit an expression of interest in obtaining an invitation to apply for a visa of that class or type; and if a person purports to submit an expression of interest in obtaining an invitation to apply for a visa contrary to paragraph (a), the expression of interest is deemed not to have been submitted. To avoid doubt, no suspension provided for by regulations made for the purposes of section 401A affects the ability of any person to claim refugee or protected person status. This section is repealed immediately after the expiry of the 12-month period that starts on the date on which the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Act 2020 comes into force. Insert the Schedule 1AA set out in Schedule 1 of this Act as the first schedule to appear after the last section of the principal Act. After section 403A, insert: The provisions of this Act identified in Schedule 6 apply as modified in that schedule. This section and Schedule 6 are repealed immediately after the expiry of the 12-month period that starts on the date on which the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Act 2020 comes into force. After Schedule 5, insert the Schedule 6 set out in Schedule 2 of this Act. Any special direction that is made under a provision of this Act inserted by the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Act 2020 and that is in force on the date when that provision is repealed (the repeal date) is revoked on that date. However, the repeal of the provisions of this Act that were inserted by the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Act 2020 and any revocation under subclause (1) do not affect— any visa condition imposed, varied, or cancelled under section 50(4A), 52(4A), or 53(4A) before the repeal date: any visa application made before the repeal date in accordance with a waiver of a prescribed requirement under section 57(3): any visa granted under section 61A before the repeal date: any extension of a visa under section 78A(1) or (2) by special direction made before the repeal date. A person’s entry permission may be revoked in accordance with section 113A(5) within 72 hours of the person first arriving in New Zealand even if the person arrived in New Zealand before the date on which the Immigration (COVID-19 Response) Amendment Act 2020 came into force.

Repeal section 19. After section 20, insert: The following kinds of overseas investment transactions are transactions of national interest: a transaction of a kind described in section 12(a) or 13(1)﻿(c) of this Act, or in section 57D(a) of the Fisheries Act 1996, where, as a result of the acquisition, the relevant estate or interest in land, property, or fishing quota is acquired by a non-NZ government investor: a transaction of a kind described in section 12(b)﻿(i) or (ii) or 13(1)﻿(a) of this Act, or in section 57D(b) of the Fisheries Act 1996, where, as a result of the acquisition, a non-NZ government investor has 10% or more ownership or control interest in A: a transaction of a kind described in section 12(a) where the estate or interest in land is used in carrying on a SIB: a transaction of a kind described in section 12(b)﻿(i) or (ii) or 13(1)﻿(a) where A is carrying on a SIB: a transaction of a kind described in section 13(1)﻿(c) where the business is or includes a SIB. The Minister must notify an applicant if the Minister considers that an application for consent involves a transaction of the kind set out in subsection (1), unless the applicant has already identified this in their application. However, failure to notify an applicant does not affect a transaction’s status as a transaction of national interest and does not invalidate any action taken by the Minister in reliance on a transaction’s status as a transaction of national interest. This section is subject to any regulations made under section 127(1).  If the Minister considers that any other overseas investment transaction for which an application for consent has been made could be contrary to New Zealand’s national interest, the Minister may notify the applicant in writing that the transaction is a transaction of national interest. The person making a decision under section 24 in relation to a particular application cannot exercise the Minister’s power under subsection (1) in relation to that application. The Minister may decline consent to a transaction of national interest if the Minister considers that the transaction is contrary to New Zealand’s national interest. The person making a decision under section 24 in relation to a particular application cannot exercise the Minister’s power under subsection (1) in relation to that application. The Minister may identify a person as a critical direct supplier if the Minister is satisfied that— the person is a direct supplier of goods or services to an intelligence or security agency; and  the goods or services are integral to the functioning of the agency as an intelligence or security agency; and the supply of those goods or services cannot readily be replaced. The Minister must— notify a person that they are a critical direct supplier; and either— publish that person’s name in a list of critical direct suppliers on an Internet site maintained by or for the regulator; or if subsection (3) applies, notify the person that they are an unpublished CDS. The Minister may defer or dispense with publication if the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that good reason for withholding the publication would exist under the Official Information Act 1982. The Minister must— notify a person if the person ceases to be a critical direct supplier; and if relevant, remove that person’s name from the list of critical direct suppliers on the Internet site maintained by or for the regulator. This section applies if a critical direct supplier has been notified that it is an unpublished CDS. An unpublished CDS must notify a person of the unpublished CDS’s status as a critical direct supplier as soon as is reasonably practicable after the earlier of— the date on which there are reasonable grounds for an unpublished CDS to conclude that the person is likely to become an investor in that unpublished CDS; and the date on which an unpublished CDS knows or ought reasonably to know or believes that the person has become an investor in that unpublished CDS. A notice under subsection (2) must— be in writing; and contain any other information specified by the Minister by notice in the Gazette.  An unpublished CDS must notify the regulator that it has given a notice under subsection (2) as soon as is reasonably practicable after the notice under subsection (2) is given.  A notice under subsection (4) must— be in writing; and contain any information specified by the Minister by notice in the Gazette; and be accompanied by a copy of the notice given under subsection (2). A person who fails to comply with this section does not commit an offence for the purposes of section 45. In this section, an investor is a person who, under a call-in transaction or a transaction of national interest, acquires sensitive assets that relate to a critical direct supplier. This section applies to— a critical direct supplier who has been notified that it is an unpublished CDS; and a person who receives a notice under section 20E; and a person to whom the status of an unpublished CDS as a critical direct supplier has been disclosed in confidence, if that person knows the critical direct supplier is an unpublished CDS. A person to whom this section applies must not knowingly or recklessly disclose the fact that an unpublished CDS is a critical direct supplier. Subsection (2) does not apply to the extent that disclosure is— required under section 20E, 23, or 87; or otherwise authorised by the regulator. A media business with significant impact, in relation to an overseas investment transaction or a call-in transaction, is a business that publishes content, or causes content to be published, if— all or a significant part of the business involves the generation or aggregation of content; and the business has a significant impact on the plurality of content available to the public or a particular section of the public, either before or as a result of the overseas person’s (or their associate’s) acquisition. Content is available to the public or a particular section of the public whether or not—  a receiver has to pay for the content; or a receiver is required to be a subscriber or member of the publishing service; or the content is delivered on the demand of a receiver; or the content is aimed at particular groups of people (for example, people who are located in a particular area of New Zealand, who have a particular interest, or who speak a particular language). In this section,— content means news, information, or opinion publish includes to transmit or broadcast by any means (including, but not limited to, Internet sites, applications, and software). Replace section 23(1)﻿(c) with: contain the information set out in regulations; and After section 23(3), insert: A person required to provide information under subsection (3) must comply with the regulator’s notice within the time, and in the manner, specified in it. In section 25A(1), replace “section 25B (which apply to every consent)” with “sections 25B and 25C”. After section 25B, insert: It is a condition of every consent relating to a transaction of national interest, whether or not it is stated in the consent, that each consent holder must not, in relation to sensitive assets in which the relevant investment is made, act or omit to act with a purpose or an intention of adversely affecting national security or public order. Replace section 31(d) with: monitor compliance with consents or orders made under this Act: In section 31(i), after “New Zealand assets”, insert “or the management of certain risks, such as national security and public order risks, associated with transactions by overseas persons”. In section 32, insert as subsections (2) and (3): However, the following cannot be delegated in accordance with subsection (1): a decision under section 20B to advise an applicant that a transaction is a transaction of national interest: a decision under section 20C that a transaction of national interest is contrary to New Zealand’s national interest: a decision under section 88, 90, 92, 93, or 96 that a call-in transaction, or an event, or the actions of an overseas person or their associate, gives rise, or is likely to give rise, to a risk referred to in section 81: a decision under section 92, 93, or 96 that a risk referred to in section 81 cannot be adequately managed in another manner or that the risk is too significant to allow a transaction to be given effect to. See also section 20B(2) or 20C(2) (a person making a decision under section 24 cannot also exercise the Minister’s power under section 20B(1) or 20C(1)). Replace section 34(3)﻿(ba) with: conditions of consents or direction orders, including conditions that this Act requires be imposed: After section 36(1)﻿(e), insert: matters relating to the national interest, national security, public order, and risk management actions: After section 37, insert: This section applies for the purposes of the standing consent in Part 4 of Schedule 1AA and of Schedule 1 (after Schedule 1 is amended by the Overseas Investment Amendment Act (No 3) 2020). The regulator must— compile and keep a list of land and reserves for which the adjoining land is sensitive under rows 10 and 11 of table 2 in Part 1 of Schedule 1; and publish that list on an Internet site maintained by or for the regulator. The regulator may amend that list. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, make regulations— setting time frames for the exercise of powers, performance of functions and duties, and provision of services under this Act: requiring information to be included in the annual report of the regulator about the extent to which those time frames are met. The time frames do not create any legal right enforceable in a court of law or affect or limit the way in which a person (for example, a Minister or the regulator) is required to exercise a statutory power of decision. In particular, no form of monetary compensation or relief, or injunctive relief, is available as a remedy if the time frames are not met. In the heading to section 38, delete “who is subject to condition”. Replace section 38(1) with: For the purpose of monitoring compliance with the terms or conditions of a consent, an exemption, an exemption certificate, a direction order, an interim direction order, a prohibition order, or a disposal order, the regulator may, by notice in writing, require a person (A) who is required to comply with any of the terms or conditions to provide the regulator with the information or documents (or both) that are specified in the notice. In section 39(1), after “New Zealand assets”, insert “or call-in transactions”. Replace section 39(1)﻿(b) with: monitoring compliance with a term or condition of a consent, an exemption, an exemption certificate, a direction order, an interim direction order, a prohibition order, or a disposal order. In the heading to section 40, delete “who is subject to condition”. Replace section 40(1) with: The regulator may, by notice in writing, require a person (A) who is required to comply with a term or condition of a consent, an exemption, an exemption certificate, a direction order, an interim direction order, a prohibition order, or a disposal order to provide the regulator with a statutory declaration verifying— the extent to which A has complied with the term or condition; and if A is in breach of a term or condition, the reasons for the breach and the steps that A intends to take to remedy the breach. In the heading to section 41, delete “for purpose of monitoring compliance, investigating, and enforcing Act and regulations”. After section 41(1A)﻿(a), insert: investigating whether a transaction is an overseas investment transaction or a call-in transaction: investigating whether a transaction, an event, or a matter is contrary to the national interest or gives rise to, or is likely to give rise to, a significant risk to national security or public order: In section 41G(3), replace “civil penalty” with “civil pecuniary penalty”. In section 42(2)﻿(b), replace “in the case of a body corporate” with “in any other case”. In section 43(2)﻿(b), replace “in the case of a body corporate” with “in any other case”. In section 44(2)﻿(b), replace “in the case of a body corporate” with “in any other case”. After section 46(1)﻿(aa), insert: any notice under section 85; or After section 46, insert: The regulator may accept an enforceable undertaking given by, or on behalf of, a person in writing in connection with a matter relating to a contravention or an alleged contravention by the person of this Act or regulations (including any matter referred to in section 48(1)).  An undertaking may include— an undertaking to pay compensation to any person or otherwise take action to avoid, remedy, or mitigate any actual or likely adverse effects arising from a contravention or possible contravention of this Act: an undertaking to pay to the regulator all or part of the regulator’s costs incurred in investigating, or bringing proceedings in relation to, a contravention or an alleged contravention. However, the regulator may not accept an undertaking to pay an amount in lieu of a civil pecuniary penalty (for example, a donation to a charity that is not connected with any loss). An undertaking may include an admission of liability by the person giving it in relation to the contravention or alleged contravention to which the undertaking relates, but otherwise does not constitute an admission of liability. The regulator must give the person making an undertaking written notice of— its decision to accept or reject the undertaking; and the reasons for the decision. An enforceable undertaking takes effect and becomes enforceable when the regulator’s decision to accept the undertaking is given to the person who made the undertaking, or at any later date specified by the regulator. A person must not contravene an enforceable undertaking given by that person that is in force.  The regulator must publish, on an Internet site maintained by, or on behalf of, the regulator, notice of the decision to accept an enforceable undertaking. The notice must include— a summary of the circumstances and nature of the contravention or alleged contravention of this Act or regulations to which the undertaking relates: a summary of the reasons for that decision: any amounts payable under the undertaking. Alternatively, the notice may include a copy of the undertaking if the undertaking contains all of the information in subsection (2). A person who has given an enforceable undertaking may at any time, with the written agreement of the regulator,— withdraw the undertaking; or vary the undertaking.  However, the provisions of the undertaking cannot be varied to provide for a different alleged contravention of this Act or regulations.  The regulator must publish on an Internet site maintained by, or on behalf of, the regulator notice of the withdrawal or variation of an enforceable undertaking. No proceedings may be brought for a contravention or an alleged contravention of this Act or regulations against— a person who made an undertaking in relation to that contravention, while the undertaking is enforceable and there is no contravention of the undertaking: a person who made, and has completely discharged, an enforceable undertaking in relation to that contravention. The regulator may accept an enforceable undertaking in relation to a contravention or an alleged contravention before proceedings in relation to that contravention have been completed. If the regulator accepts an enforceable undertaking before the proceedings are completed, the regulator must take all reasonable steps to have the proceedings discontinued as soon as practicable. Before section 47, insert: The regulator may apply to the court for an order if a person contravenes an enforceable undertaking. If the court is satisfied that the person who made the enforceable undertaking has contravened the undertaking, the court may make any of the following orders:  a civil pecuniary penalty not exceeding $50,000 for an individual or $300,000 in any other case: an order directing the person to comply with the undertaking:  an order discharging the undertaking.  In addition to the orders referred to in subsection (2), the court may make any other order that the court considers appropriate in the circumstances, including— orders directing the person to pay to the regulator the costs of the proceedings and the reasonable costs of the regulator in monitoring compliance with the enforceable undertaking in the future: an order in respect of the contravention or alleged contravention of this Act or regulations to which the enforceable undertaking relates, as if no undertaking had been made. The court must, before making an order under section 46F, take into account— the nature and extent of the contravention; and any loss or damage caused by the contravention; and any financial gain made, or loss avoided, from the contravention; and the circumstances in which the contravention took place (including whether the contravention was intentional, inadvertent, or caused by negligence); and  the purpose of this Act; and any other matters that it considers relevant. In section 47(1)﻿(d), replace “a consent or of an exemption” with “a consent, an exemption, or a direction order”. In section 47(3)﻿(b), replace “interest” with “estate or interest”. In the heading to section 48, replace “civil penalty” with “civil pecuniary penalty”. In section 48(1), replace “civil penalty” with “civil pecuniary penalty”. Replace section 48(1)﻿(d) with: failed to comply with a condition of a consent, an exemption, an exemption certificate, a direction order, or an interim direction order; or Replace section 48(2) with: The court may order A to pay a civil pecuniary penalty not exceeding the highest of the following: $500,000 in the case of an individual or $10 million in any other case: 3 times the amount of any quantifiable gain (for example, the increase in the value since acquisition) by A in relation to the property to which the consent, exemption, exemption certificate, direction order, interim direction order, prohibition order, or disposal order relates or for which a consent should have been obtained: the cost of remedying the breach of condition: the cost of remedying the breach of a term of a prohibition order or a direction order: the loss suffered by a person in relation to a breach of a term of a condition. In section 48(2A), replace “civil penalty” with “civil pecuniary penalty”. In section 49(1), replace “a consent, an exemption, or an exemption certificate” with “a consent, an exemption, an exemption certificate, a direction order, an interim direction order, a prohibition order, or a disposal order”. Replace section 49(1)﻿(a) with: the performance of any obligation, or the repayment of any money, under a term or condition of the consent, the exemption, the exemption certificate, the direction order, the interim direction order, the prohibition order, or the disposal order; or In section 49(1)﻿(b), replace “civil penalty” with “civil pecuniary penalty”. In section 50(1),— replace “a consent, an exemption, or an exemption certificate” with “a consent, an exemption, an exemption certificate, a direction order, or an interim direction order”; and replace “civil penalty” with “civil pecuniary penalty”. In the heading to section 51, replace “consent, exemption, or exemption certificate” with “consent, exemption, exemption certificate, direction order, or interim direction order”. After section 51(1)﻿(b), insert: a person who is subject to a direction order or an interim direction order. In section 51(2)﻿(a) and (b), replace “a consent, an exemption, or an exemption certificate” with “a consent, an exemption, an exemption certificate, a direction order, or an interim direction order”. After section 51, insert: The court may, on the application of the regulator or any other person, grant an injunction— restraining a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes or would constitute a contravention of this Act or regulations (including any matter referred to in section 48(1)): requiring a person to do an act or a thing if— that person has refused or failed, or is refusing or failing, or is proposing to refuse or fail, to do that act or thing; and the refusal or failure was, is, or would be a breach of this Act or regulations. The court may at any time rescind or vary an injunction granted under this Part.  The court may grant an injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct of a particular kind if—  it is satisfied that the person has engaged in conduct of that kind; or it appears to the court that, if an injunction is not granted, it is likely that the person will engage in conduct of that kind.  The court may grant an interim injunction restraining a person from engaging in conduct of a particular kind if in its opinion it is desirable to do so.  Subsections (1)﻿(a) and (2) apply whether or not it appears to the court that the person intends to engage again, or to continue to engage, in conduct of that kind. Subsections (1)﻿(b) and (2) apply whether or not the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind or there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any other person if that person engages in conduct of that kind. A court may grant an injunction requiring a person to do an act or a thing if— it is satisfied that the person has refused or failed to do that act or thing; or it appears to the court that, if an injunction is not granted, it is likely that the person will refuse or fail to do that thing. The court may grant an interim injunction requiring a person to do an act or a thing if in its opinion it is desirable to do so. Subsections (1)﻿(a) and (2) apply whether or not it appears to the court that the person intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail, to do that act or thing. Subsections (1)﻿(b) and (2) apply— whether or not the person has previously refused or failed to do that act or thing; or where there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any other person if that person refuses or fails to do that act or thing. If the regulator applies to the court for the grant of an interim injunction under this subpart, the court must not, as a condition of granting an interim injunction, require the regulator to give an undertaking as to damages. In determining the regulator’s application for the grant of an interim injunction, the court must not take into account that the regulator is not required to give an undertaking as to damages. The regulator may defer or dispense with publication of a matter under this subpart (in whole or in part) if the regulator is satisfied on reasonable grounds that good reason for withholding the publication would exist under the Official Information Act 1982. In the heading to section 51A, delete “interest in”. Replace section 51A(1) with: This section applies if— a person (A) is acquiring an estate or interest in residential land under a transaction, other than an interest under a mortgage, an interest under any other security arrangement, or an exempted interest; and an instrument recording A’s acquisition of the estate or interest will be lodged by or under the direction of a conveyancer. In section 51C(3), replace “civil penalty” with “civil pecuniary penalty”. In section 52(1), replace “a condition of a consent, an exemption, or an exemption certificate” with “a term or condition of a consent, an exemption, an exemption certificate, a direction order, an interim direction order, a prohibition order, or a disposal order”. In section 54, replace “consent holder, holder of an exemption under section 61D, and holder of an exemption certificate” with “consent holder, holder of an exemption under section 61D, holder of an exemption certificate, and recipient of a direction order, an interim direction order, a prohibition order, or a disposal order”. In section 54, insert as subsection (2): However, subsection (1) does not apply to a recipient of a direction order referred to in section 88(1)﻿(a) (which relates to transactions in respect of which no conditions are imposed). In section 54A(2)﻿(d), replace “a consent, an exemption, or an exemption certificate” with “a consent, an exemption, an exemption certificate, a direction order, or an interim direction order”. After section 61(1)﻿(l), insert: providing for definitions for the purposes of section 82(2): prescribing enactments for the purposes of the standing consent in Part 4 of Schedule 1AA and of rows 10 and 11 of table 2 in Part 1 of Schedule 1 (after Schedule 1 is amended by the Overseas Investment Amendment Act (No 3) 2020): exempting, if necessary or desirable to respond to an epidemic in New Zealand, any transaction, person, interest, right, or assets, or any class of transactions, persons, interests, rights, or assets, from the requirement for consent or from the definition of overseas person or associate or associated land: After section 61(2), insert:  Any exemptions made in respect of the matters in subsection (1)﻿(lc) are revoked on the 42nd day after the date on which the Overseas Investment Amendment Act (No 3) 2020 receives the Royal assent. Replace section 61B(a) with: provide flexibility where compliance with this Act is impractical, inefficient, unduly costly, or unduly burdensome, taking into account the sensitivity of the sensitive assets and the nature of the overseas investment transaction; or After section 61B(c)﻿(vii), insert: persons, transactions, rights, interests, or assets that the Minister considers to be fundamentally New Zealand owned or controlled or to have a strong connection to New Zealand: persons, transactions, rights, interests, or assets that the Minister considers support, or are related to, the issuance or management of residential mortgage-backed securities complying with a standard created or endorsed by the Reserve Bank. In section 61D(3), after “regulator”, insert “, unless section 61F(6) applies”. In section 61F(6), delete “if they were official information”. After section 80, insert: The purpose of this Part is to manage— significant national security and public order risks associated with transactions by overseas persons; and  while the emergency notification regime is in place, risks associated with transactions by overseas persons that are contrary to New Zealand’s national interest. In order to give effect to that purpose, the Minister may— review call-in transactions in accordance with subpart 1; and take any of the following actions in accordance with subpart 2: make a direction order in relation to a call-in transaction (see sections 88 to 90): make a prohibition order in relation to a call-in transaction (see section 92): make a disposal order in relation to an investment given effect to under a call-in transaction or a transaction of national interest (see section 93): make a recommendation that a person be put into statutory management (see section 96). The Minister may also make an interim direction order if the Minister is considering whether to take any of those actions, or what kind of action to take, in relation to a call-in transaction (see section 91). A call-in transaction is a transaction by an overseas person or an associate of an overseas person that— is an overseas investment covered by the emergency notification regime; but does not require consent (see section 10). An overseas investment is an overseas investment covered by the emergency notification regime if it is— the acquisition by an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas person, of rights or interests in securities of a person (A) if, as a result of the acquisition, the overseas person or the associate (either alone or together with its associates) has— a more than 25% ownership or control interest in A; or  an increase in an existing more than 25% ownership or control interest in A to either a more than 50% or 75% ownership or control interest in A or a 100% ownership or control interest in A; or  an interest defined in the regulations: the acquisition by an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas person, of property (including goodwill and other intangible assets) in New Zealand used in carrying on business in New Zealand (whether by 1 transaction or a series of related or linked transactions) of any value that effectively amounts to a change in control of the business, as defined in the regulations. This section is subject to any regulations made under section 127(1). The Minister may determine which 1 or more of the following persons is the relevant acquirer for a call-in transaction: the person making the overseas investment (A), whether A is an overseas person or an associate of an overseas person: any associate of A in relation to the overseas investment. The Minister must review a call-in transaction that is notified under section 85. The Minister must take a risk management action following a review under subsection (1). The Minister may review any call-in transaction that should have been notified under section 85. The purpose of a review is to determine whether the transaction gives rise, or is likely to give rise, to a risk referred to in section 81. However, if a direction order has already been made in relation to a call-in transaction, the Minister cannot review that transaction, or take another risk management action in relation to the transaction, unless the direction order is revoked in accordance with section 90. Each overseas person or associate making a call-in transaction must notify the regulator before giving effect to the call-in transaction. A call-in transaction must not be given effect to unless the Minister makes a direction order in relation to that transaction. A person who fails to comply with this section does not commit an offence under section 45. The Minister must commence an assessment, no later than 45 days after the commencement of this section, to ensure that the classes of transactions that are subject to the emergency notification regime are not broader than are reasonably necessary having regard to the purposes of this Part. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister, make regulations— extending the effect of any exemption made under this Act so that the exemption also applies to any requirements under the emergency notification regime: doing anything necessary or desirable to ensure that the classes of transactions that are subject to the emergency notification regime are not broader than are reasonably necessary, having regard to the purposes of this Part. The Minister must, by notice, authorise the manner in which a notification under section 85 must be given, including by doing any of the following: specifying the required content of the notification, which may include any information that the Minister thinks relevant:  approving or prescribing 1 or more forms for the notification or 1 or more methods for making the notification (or both): authorising the notification to be given on behalf of the overseas person or associate referred to in section 85(1) (including the manner for doing so). The regulator must— notify the making of the notice in the Gazette; and publish the notice on an Internet site maintained by, or on behalf of, the regulator.  The notice is a disallowable instrument but not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the Legislation Act 2012 and must be presented to the House of Representatives under section 41 of that Act. The regulator may, by notice in writing, require 1 or more persons giving a notification under section 85 to provide a statutory declaration verifying that the information contained in the notification is true and correct.  For the purpose of considering the notification under section 85, the regulator may, by notice in writing, require a relevant acquirer, or any other person with information relevant to the notification, to provide the information specified in the regulator’s notice and in a form specified by the regulator’s notice.  A notification under section 85 must be accompanied by the relevant fee (if any), unless this has already been paid. The Minister may give a direction order to a relevant acquirer following a review of a call-in transaction,— notifying that no conditions are imposed (and that the relevant acquirer may give effect to the transaction accordingly); or if the direction order is subject to conditions, requiring compliance with the conditions of the order if the call-in transaction is or has been given effect to. A direction order is subject to any conditions (if any) that the Minister thinks appropriate to manage a risk referred to in section 81. The Minister may impose conditions only if the Minister considers that the call-in transaction gives rise, or is likely to give rise, to a risk referred to in section 81. When imposing conditions, the Minister must have regard to New Zealand’s international obligations. A direction order may be varied by the Minister with the agreement of the relevant acquirer. Any conditions of a direction order may be varied or added to by the Minister with the agreement of the relevant acquirer. A condition of a direction order may be revoked by the Minister. The Minister may revoke a direction order if the Minister is satisfied that— 1 or more of the following events or matters have occurred in connection with the direction order or the call-in transaction that the order relates to: a notice under section 85 or any information provided under section 87(2) contained a statement that was false or misleading in any material particular or any material omission: a notice under section 85 or any information provided under section 87(2) provided the Minister with a document that was false or misleading in any material particular: a person has breached a condition of a direction order: a person has contravened an enforceable undertaking (see sections 46A to 46F); and the event or matter gives rise, or is likely to give rise, to a risk referred to in section 81. The Minister may give an interim order of the kind referred to in section 88 to a relevant acquirer if the Minister is considering whether to take a risk management action, or what kind of risk management action to take, in relation to a call-in transaction. Sections 88(2) and (4) and 89 apply to an interim direction order as if it were a direction order. The Minister may impose conditions only if the Minister considers that the call-in transaction could give rise to a risk referred to in section 81. An interim direction order is in force until the earlier of— the date specified in regulations; and the date on which the Minister takes a risk management action in relation to the relevant call-in transaction. The Minister may revoke an interim direction order at any time. The Minister may give a prohibition order to a relevant acquirer following a review of a call-in transaction, prohibiting the call-in transaction from being given effect to. A prohibition order may— specify any reasonable steps that must be taken in order to comply with the prohibition order: require the person to report to the regulator within the time specified in the order stating how and when the order has been or will be implemented. The Minister may give a prohibition order only if the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that— the call-in transaction gives rise, or is likely to give rise, to a risk referred to in section 81; and the risk cannot be adequately managed by giving the relevant acquirer a direction order. When acting under this section, the Minister must have regard to New Zealand’s international obligations. A person who is given a prohibition order must comply with it. The Minister may give a disposal order to an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas person, who acquired sensitive assets under a transaction of national interest or a call-in transaction. A disposal order may— require disposal of the whole or any part of the sensitive assets owned by the person or their associate: specify the time within which or manner in which the disposal must be made: specify any reasonable steps that must be taken in order to comply with the disposal order: require the person to report to the regulator within the time specified in the order stating how and when the order has been or will be implemented. The Minister may give a disposal order to a person only if the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that— the transaction gives rise, or is likely to give rise, or has given rise to a risk referred to in section 81; and the risk cannot be adequately managed by taking an enforcement action under subpart 5 of Part 2 or (in the case of sensitive assets acquired under a call-in transaction) giving a direction order to the relevant acquirer. See also section 112, which applies when the Minister is giving a disposal order in connection with a transaction of national interest. The Minister must have regard to New Zealand’s international obligations when acting under this section. A person who is given a disposal order must comply with it within the time, and in the manner, specified in the order. The purpose of statutory management under this subpart is to manage the risks to national security or public order associated with actions by an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas person, who has an interest in sensitive assets, including (without limitation) removing the overseas person’s, or their associate’s, access to or control over the sensitive assets. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister,— declare that a person who owns sensitive assets is subject to statutory management; and declare that an associate of a person who owns sensitive assets is subject to statutory management; and vest the assets identified in accordance with section 103 in the statutory manager for the purposes of disposing of those assets under that section; and appoint 1 or more persons as statutory manager or statutory managers of the person for a specified period. If an order is made under subsection (1),— every subsidiary of a person declared to be subject to statutory management, except any subsidiary declared to be a subsidiary to which the order does not apply, is subject to statutory management; and the appointment of a statutory manager for the specified period in respect of the person under statutory management also applies to those subsidiaries. If the order appoints 2 or more persons as statutory managers,— the order must state whether the powers of a statutory manager are to be exercised by those persons acting jointly or may be exercised individually; and  references in this Act to a statutory manager include references to the statutory managers. In this section, a person includes a body of persons whether incorporated or not. The Minister may make a recommendation under section 95 only if— an overseas person, or an associate of the overseas person, acquired sensitive assets under a transaction of national interest or a call-in transaction; and the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that,—  in relation to the sensitive assets, the overseas person or their associate has acted, is acting, or is likely to act in a manner that gives or is likely to give rise to a significant risk to national security or public order; and the risk cannot be adequately managed by making a direction order (in the case of assets acquired under a call-in transaction), a disposal order, or taking an enforcement action under subpart 5 of Part 2. The Minister must have regard to New Zealand’s international obligations when acting under this section. See also section 112, which applies when the Minister is making a recommendation in connection with a transaction of national interest. Section 95 applies only to the person’s property, rights, assets, and liabilities relating to its New Zealand business or, if the person has business undertakings unrelated to the sensitive assets, that part of its New Zealand business that relates to the sensitive assets. Every order made under section 95 must specify the date on which, and the time at which, it comes into force. The date and time specified must not be earlier than the date on which, and the time at which, the order is made. If a question arises as to whether, on the date on which a statutory manager was appointed, an act was done or a transaction was entered into or effected before or after the appointment, the act or transaction must, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be treated as having been done, entered into, or effected, as the case may be, after the appointment of the statutory manager. In exercising the powers conferred on them under this subpart, a statutory manager must have regard to— the purpose of statutory management (see section 94); and to the extent not inconsistent with paragraph (a), the desirability of preserving the interests of members and creditors of the person under statutory management and the overseas person or, where appropriate, the need to protect the beneficiaries under any trust administered by the person under statutory management or the overseas person or the public interest; and to the extent not inconsistent with paragraphs (a) and (b), the need to preserve the business or undertaking of the person under statutory management and the overseas person. A statutory manager must, in relation to the statutory management,— consult the regulator as and when required by the regulator; and have regard to any advice given to the statutory manager by the regulator; and comply with any directions given under section 100; and provide any reports required under section 100; and notify the regulator before taking an action under— section 50(1) or (2) of the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989 (power of statutory manager to sell business undertaking of corporation) (as applied by section 105(i)): section 52(1) of the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989 (power of statutory manager to put corporation into liquidation) (as applied by section 105(j)): section 103 (power to sell vested property): section 104 (power to terminate contracts). The regulator may, in relation to the conduct of the statutory management,— give advice to the statutory manager; and give written directions to the statutory manager; and require a statutory manager to give to the regulator, or to other persons specified by the regulator, reports about the conduct of the statutory management and the state of the affairs or business of the person under statutory management. A report required under subsection (1)﻿(c) must be given in the way, and within the period, required by the regulator. When acting under this section, the regulator must have regard to— the purpose of statutory management (see section 94); and New Zealand’s international obligations. If a person declared to be subject to statutory management is a body corporate incorporated outside New Zealand or an unincorporated body that has its head office or principal place of business outside New Zealand, the statutory manager may— form and register a body corporate under the Companies Act 1993 or any other Act: subscribe for or acquire, as trustee for the person, all or any of the shares of the body corporate: allot or issue all or any of the shares in the body corporate as fully or partly paid, as the case may be, up to the value of any property, rights, and assets vested in the body corporate under subsection (2) (after deducting the value of any liabilities so vested). The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, declare that the whole or any part of any property, rights, assets, and liabilities of the person relating to its New Zealand business will vest in the body corporate referred to in subsection (1)﻿(a) on a date specified in the order (and the property, rights, assets, and liabilities vest in the body corporate on the date specified). Nothing in subsection (2) reduces, extinguishes, or affects any obligation or liability of a person. If a body corporate is formed under subsection (1)﻿(a),— the body corporate is subject to statutory management under this subpart as if it had been declared to be so by an order under section 95; and the body corporate has the same statutory manager as the person under statutory management; and the provisions in this Act relating to statutory management apply (with any necessary modifications) as if the body corporate were a person under statutory management. If a body corporate is formed and registered under section 50(2)﻿(a) of the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989, as applied by section 105(i),— the body corporate is subject to statutory management under this subpart as if it had been declared to be so by an order under section 95; and the body corporate has the same statutory manager as the person under statutory management; and the provisions in this Act relating to statutory management apply (with any necessary modifications) as if the body corporate were a person under statutory management. This section applies to sensitive assets owned by any overseas person or their associate if— the overseas person or their associate is acting in the manner described in section 96(1)﻿(b); but the order under section 95 will not make that overseas person or associate subject to statutory management. The order may identify the whole or any part of the sensitive assets as assets to be vested in the statutory manager. The order may identify the assets either individually or as a group or class. The assets identified in the order are vested in the statutory manager on the date on which and time at which the order comes into force (see section 98). The statutory manager may sell or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of the vested assets to any person, on any terms and conditions, that the statutory manager considers appropriate. The provisions of sections 51 and 72 of the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989 apply, with any necessary modifications, to a sale of vested assets under this section as if the sale were a sale under section 50(1) of that Act. If the statutory manager considers that a contract or an arrangement entered into by the person under statutory management gives rise, or is likely to give rise, to a significant risk to national security or public order, the statutory manager may cancel that contract or arrangement. If a contract or an arrangement is cancelled under this section,— the person under statutory management is discharged from the further performance of the contract or arrangement and from all liabilities for subsequent non-performance of the contract or arrangement; and the other party to the contract or arrangement may apply to the court for compensation in respect of the contract or arrangement. An application under subsection (2)﻿(b) must be made within 3 months of the person receiving notice of the cancellation. The court may award any compensation that it considers just and reasonable, having regard to— the value of the consideration provided by the person; and all amounts and benefits that the person has received under the contract or arrangement; and the conduct of the parties. The following provisions of the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989 apply for the purposes of a statutory management under this Act, with all necessary modifications as if a person declared to be subject to statutory management under this Act were a corporation declared to be subject to statutory management under that Act: section 42 (moratorium): section 43 (prohibition against removal of assets from New Zealand), except that a person who commits an offence under section 43(2) is liable on conviction,— in the case of an individual, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a fine not exceeding $300,000: in any other case, to a fine not exceeding $300,000: section 44 (statutory manager may suspend payment of money owing): section 45 (management of corporation to vest in statutory manager): section 46 (powers of statutory manager): section 47 (statutory manager may carry on business of corporation): section 48 (statutory manager may pay creditors and compromise claims): section 49 (termination of contract of agency or service): sections 50, 51, 53, and 72 (statutory manager may sell business undertaking of corporation), but subject to the modifications in section 110: section 52 (liquidation of corporations): section 54 (power to trace property improperly disposed of): section 55 (application of certain provisions of Companies Act 1993): section 58 (statutory manager may apply to court for directions): section 59 (court may confer additional powers on statutory manager): section 61 (prior winding up, liquidation, or receivership to cease): section 64 (corporation not entitled to be consulted about exercise of powers): section 66 (advances to statutory managers and members of advisory committees): section 67 (duty to deliver books and property to statutory manager): section 68 (offence to destroy, alter, or conceal records), except that a person who commits an offence under section 68(1) is liable on conviction,— in the case of an individual, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a fine not exceeding $300,000: in any other case, to a fine not exceeding $300,000: section 69 (duty to report offences), except that— the reference to a person being guilty of an offence includes a person being liable to a civil pecuniary penalty under this Act: in relation to an offence, or to a liability to a civil pecuniary penalty, under this Act, the duty to report the matter to the Solicitor-General includes a duty also to report the matter to the regulator: sections 71 and 71A (application of other Acts). The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, declare that a person under statutory management is to cease to be subject to statutory management. The order must specify the date on which, and the time at which, it comes into force. A person under statutory management ceases to be subject to statutory management if the person is put into liquidation on the application of the statutory manager. If an order is made under section 106, or a person under statutory management is put into liquidation as referred to in section 106(3), the following happens at the specified time: the person under statutory management ceases to be subject to statutory management: the appointment of the statutory manager terminates. In subsection (1), specified time means, as the case requires,— the date and time specified in the order; or the date and time of the liquidator’s appointment. A statutory manager has, and may exercise, all of the powers conferred on a liquidator of a company by sections 261 to 267 of the Companies Act 1993 in the same manner as if the statutory manager were the liquidator of a company in liquidation under that Act (and, for that purpose, section 373(3) of that Act applies with all necessary modifications). No statutory manager is liable for an act done or omitted to be done in the performance or exercise in good faith of the statutory manager’s functions, duties, or powers under this Act. The Crown indemnifies the statutory manager for any liability that arises from the exercise or purported exercise of, or omission to exercise, any power conferred by this Act unless it is shown that the exercise or purported exercise of, or omission to exercise, the power was in bad faith. Any money required for the purposes of this section must be paid out of a Crown Bank Account without further authority than this section. The indemnity conferred by subsection (2) extends to legal costs incurred in defending a proceeding. All costs, charges, and expenses properly incurred by a statutory manager in the exercise of the manager’s functions or powers under this subpart (including any remuneration approved by the Minister) are payable by the Crown. The Crown is entitled to recover the amounts paid under subsection (1) from either of the following: the proceeds of sale or other disposition of any vested assets: the proceeds of sale or other disposition of the sensitive assets of the overseas person or their associate’s (whether sold or disposed of as part of the sale of the business undertaking of the person under statutory management or otherwise). Section 51 of the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989 (as applied by section 105(i)) must be read as if a reference to the costs of the statutory manager in selling or disposing of the relevant property were a reference to the Crown’s rights to be repaid under subsection (2). This section applies if a person who will be made subject to statutory management by an order under section 95 is any of the following: a registered bank (within the meaning of section 2(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989): a covered bond SPV (within the meaning of section 139B of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989): a licensed insurer (within the meaning of section 6(1) of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010): a non-bank deposit taker (within the meaning of NBDT in section 5 of the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013): an operator of a designated settlement system (within the meaning of section 156N of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989). The Minister must consult the Reserve Bank before making a recommendation under section 96. Section 99(1) does not apply and instead the statutory manager must have regard to— the purpose of statutory management (see section 94): the need to maintain public confidence in the operation and soundness of the financial system: the need to avoid significant damage to the financial system: to the extent not inconsistent with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c), the desirability of preserving the interests of members and creditors of the person under statutory management and the overseas person or, where appropriate, the need to protect the beneficiaries under any trust administered by the person under statutory management or the overseas person or the public interest: to the extent not inconsistent with paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d), the need to preserve the business or undertaking of the person under statutory management and the overseas person. The statutory manager must have regard to any advice given to the statutory manager by the Reserve Bank. A notice under section 99(2)﻿(e) must also be given to the Reserve Bank. Section 100 is amended as it relates to directions so that— a direction under section 100(1)﻿(b) must be given jointly by the Reserve Bank and the regulator; and section 100(3) applies to the regulator and the Reserve Bank; and when making a joint direction, the Reserve Bank and the regulator must have regard to the matters set out in subsection (3)﻿(b) and (c). A requirement for a report under section 100(1)﻿(c) may be made by the regulator or the Reserve Bank.  The Minister may only make a disposal order or a recommendation that a person be put into statutory management in connection with a transaction of national interest for which consent has been granted if the Minister is satisfied that— 1 or more of the following events or matters have occurred in connection with the relevant consent or the transaction of national interest that the consent relates to: an application under section 23 or any information provided under section 23(3) contained a statement that was false or misleading in any material particular or any material omission: an application under section 23 or any information provided under section 23(3) provided the Minister with a document that was false or misleading in any material particular: a person has breached a condition of a consent: a person has contravened an enforceable undertaking (see sections 46A to 46G); and that the event or matter gives rise, or is likely to give rise,— in the case of a disposal order, to a risk referred to in section 81: in the case of a recommendation that a person be put into statutory management, to a significant risk to national security or public order. This subpart applies to any civil proceedings (including public law and judicial review proceedings) in a court relating to the administration or enforcement of this Act. In this subpart, classified security information means information— that is relevant to any proceedings in a court that relate to the administration or enforcement of this Act (or to any intended proceedings); and that is held by an agency listed in section 126(2); and that the head of the agency, in the case of information held by an intelligence or security agency, or the Attorney-General, in the case of information held by any other agency, certifies in writing cannot be disclosed except to the extent provided in this subpart because, in the opinion of the head of the agency or the Attorney-General (as applicable),— the information is information of a kind specified in subsection (2); and disclosure of the information would be disclosure of a kind specified in subsection (3). Information falls within subsection (1)﻿(c)﻿(i) if it— might lead to the identification of, or provide details of, the source of the information, the nature, content, or scope of the information, or the nature or type of the assistance or operational methods available to the agency; or is about particular operations that have been undertaken, or are being or are proposed to be undertaken, in relation to any of the functions of the agency; or has been provided to the agency by the Government of another country or by an agency of the Government of another country or by an international organisation, and is information that cannot be disclosed by the agency because the Government or agency or organisation by which the information has been provided will not consent to the disclosure. Disclosure of information falls within subsection (1)﻿(c)﻿(ii) if the disclosure would be likely— to prejudice the security or defence of New Zealand or the international relations of the Government of New Zealand; or to prejudice the entrusting of information to the Government of New Zealand on a basis of confidence by the Government of another country or any agency of such a Government, or by any international organisation; or to prejudice the maintenance of the law, including the prevention, investigation, and detection of offences, and the right to a fair trial; or to endanger the safety of any person. In this subpart,— intended party has the meaning set out in section 117(1)﻿(a)﻿(i) intended proceedings means the proceedings that an intended party intends to commence as notified under section 117(1)﻿(a)﻿(ii) non-Crown party, in relation to proceedings, means a person (other than the Crown) that is a party to the proceedings representative includes a barrister or solicitor engaged to act on behalf of a party special advocate means a person appointed under section 118(2). The Crown must, after proceedings are commenced, provide the court with access to the classified security information that is relevant to those proceedings. If a special advocate is appointed before proceedings are commenced, the Crown must provide the court with access to the classified security information that is relevant to the intended proceedings. The court must keep confidential and must not disclose any information provided as classified security information, even if it considers that the information does not meet the criteria set out in section 114(2) and (3), unless the head of the agency (in the case of information held by an intelligence or security agency) or the Attorney-General (in the case of information held by any other agency) consents to its release. Subsection (3) applies both during and after completion of the proceedings. The court may, in order to comply with section 115(3), make 1 or more of the following orders: an order forbidding publication of any report or account of the whole or any part of the evidence adduced or the submissions made in the proceedings: an order forbidding the publication of the name of any witness or witnesses, or any name or particulars likely to lead to the identification of any witness or witnesses: an order forbidding the publication of classified security information or information about classified security information: an order excluding any person from the whole or any part of the court’s proceedings, including— the non-Crown party or the non-Crown party’s representative; or staff of the court. An order made under subsection (1)— may be made for a limited period or permanently; and if it is made for a limited period, may be renewed for a further period or periods by the court; and if it is made permanently, may be reviewed by the court at any time. This section applies if— it appears to a court that— a person (the intended party) is or may be entitled to commence proceedings to which this subpart will or may apply but it is necessary for a special advocate to be appointed before the proceedings can be commenced; and the intended party has notified the Crown that the party intends to commence those proceedings and that the party will apply for the appointment of a special advocate; or proceedings have been commenced and information presented, or proposed to be presented, in those proceedings includes classified security information; or proceedings have been commenced but the non-Crown party’s claim cannot be fully particularised without the non-Crown party being able to consider classified security information. The court may, on the application of an intended party or a non-Crown party, appoint a barrister or solicitor as a special advocate to represent the intended party’s or the non-Crown party’s interests on the terms that the court may direct if the court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in order to ensure either or both of the following: that the intended party can properly prepare and commence proceedings: that a fair hearing will occur. The court must, before appointing a person as a special advocate, be satisfied that the person— holds an appropriate security clearance that allows the person to see information that is or may be classified security information; and is suitably qualified and experienced to fulfil the role of a special advocate. A special advocate appointed to represent an intended party may, after the proceedings are commenced, continue to act as the special advocate on behalf of that person (as a non-Crown party), subject to the terms that the court may direct. The court may make directions as to the terms of the appointment, and on the matters referred to in sections 120 and 121(3), before or after the proceedings are commenced. The appointment of a special advocate does not create an obligation requiring the intended party to commence proceedings. The agency to which the proceedings or intended proceedings relate must meet the actual and reasonable costs of a special advocate on a basis— agreed between the special advocate and the head of the agency (in the case of an intelligence or security agency) or the Attorney-General (in the case of any other agency); or determined by the court (in default of agreement). Each of the following may nominate a barrister or solicitor to be appointed as the special advocate: the Crown: the intended party or the non-Crown party (as the case may be). The court may appoint a person nominated under subsection (1) or another person. The role of a special advocate is to represent an intended party or a non-Crown party. In particular, a special advocate may— prepare and commence proceedings on behalf of the person: examine and cross-examine witnesses: make oral and written submissions to the court: assist in the settlement of the proceedings. At all times, a special advocate must act in accordance with his or her duties as an officer of the High Court. A special advocate must keep confidential and must not disclose classified security information, except as expressly provided or authorised under this Act. A special advocate may, before or after the commencement of proceedings, apply to the court for access to the classified security information. The court may provide access to the classified security information to the special advocate on the terms that the court may direct. A special advocate may communicate with the relevant party or the relevant party’s representative on an unlimited basis until the special advocate has been provided with access to the classified security information. After the special advocate has been given access to the classified security information, he or she must not communicate with any person about any matter connected with the classified security information except in accordance with this section. A special advocate who, after having been given access to the classified security information, wishes to communicate with the relevant party, the relevant party’s representative, or any other person not referred to in subsection (4) may do so on the terms that the court may direct. A special advocate may, without the approval of the court, communicate about any matter connected with the classified security information with— the court: the Crown’s security-cleared representative: the Attorney-General: the head of the agency to which the proceedings relate, or the agency’s security-cleared representative. In this section, relevant party means the intended party or non-Crown party. To the extent that a special advocate is acting in accordance with the requirements of this Act, the special advocate is not guilty of— misconduct within the meaning of section 7 or 9 of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006; or unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of section 12 of that Act. This subpart applies despite the requirements of any practice rules made and approved under the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006. No person is personally liable for any act done or omitted to be done in good faith, in his or her capacity as a special advocate, in accordance with the requirements or provisions of this Act. The court must determine the proceedings on the basis of information available to it (whether or not that information has been disclosed to or responded to by all parties to the proceedings). If information presented, or proposed to be presented, in the proceedings by the Crown includes classified security information,— except where proceedings are before the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court, the proceedings must be heard and determined by the Chief High Court Judge, or by 1 or more Judges nominated by the Chief High Court Judge, or both; and the court must, on a request by the Attorney-General and if satisfied that it is necessary to do so for the protection of (either all or part of) the classified security information, receive or hear (the relevant part or all of) the classified security information in the absence of all or any of— the non-Crown party; and the barristers or solicitors (if any) representing the non-Crown party; and journalists; and members of the public. Without limiting subsection (2),— the court may approve a summary of the classified security information that is presented by the Attorney-General except to the extent that a summary of any particular part of the information would itself involve disclosure that would be likely to prejudice the interests referred to in section 114(3); and on being approved by the court, a copy of the summary must be given to the non-Crown party. Subsections (1) to (3) apply despite any enactment or rule of law to the contrary. Nothing in this subpart limits section 27 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1950 or any rule of law that authorises or requires the withholding of a document or the refusal to answer a question on the ground that the disclosure of the document or the answering of the question would be injurious to the public interest. Any general practices and procedures that may be necessary to implement the procedures specified in this subpart and to ensure that classified security information is protected in all proceedings to which this subpart applies must be agreed between the Chief Justice and the Attorney-General as soon as practicable after the commencement of this section, and revised from time to time. General practices and procedures may be agreed under subsection (1) on the following matters: measures relating to the physical protection of the information during all proceedings to which this subpart relates: the manner in which the information may be provided to the court: measures to preserve the integrity of the information until any appeals are withdrawn or finally determined. Subsection (2) does not limit subsection (1). Any agency identified in subsection (2) (a disclosing agency) may disclose to any other agency identified in subsection (2) (a receiving agency) any information held by the disclosing agency if the disclosing agency has reasonable grounds to believe that the disclosure of that information is necessary for the purpose of managing national security and public order risks associated with transactions by overseas persons. The agencies are— an intelligence or security agency: the Department of Internal Affairs: the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet: the Inland Revenue Department: Land Information New Zealand: the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment: the Ministry of Defence: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade: the New Zealand Customs Service: the New Zealand Police: New Zealand Trade and Enterprise: the Reserve Bank: the Treasury: the regulator: any other agency set out in regulations. A receiving agency may use information that is disclosed in reliance on this section only for the purpose of managing national security and public order risks, and only in accordance with this section and the regulations (if any), despite anything to the contrary in the Privacy Act 1993. Before disclosing information in reliance on this section, a disclosing agency must impose conditions that the disclosing agency considers are needed to ensure that subsection (3) is complied with, including conditions relating to— the storage and use of, or access to, anything provided: the copying, returning, or disposing of copies of any documents provided. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister, make regulations for all or any of the following purposes: prescribing agencies for the purposes of subsection (2)﻿(o): governing the disclosure and use of information under this section, including— the types of information that may be disclosed: the conditions that must be imposed when the information is disclosed. The Minister must consult with the Privacy Commissioner before recommending that regulations be made under this section. The Minister must, before making a recommendation that an agency be prescribed under subsection (2)﻿(o), be satisfied that it is necessary that information is able to be disclosed to that agency for the purpose of managing national security and public order risks. This section applies despite anything to the contrary in any contract, deed, or document. The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister, make regulations for all or any of the following purposes: prescribing classes of technology that are or are not military or dual-use technology: prescribing classes of information that are not sensitive information: prescribing classes of businesses that are or are not strategically important businesses: prescribing classes of transactions that are not— transactions of national interest: call-in transactions:  overseas investments covered by the emergency notification regime: overseas investments in SIB assets: prescribing a date for notification for the purposes of section 86. The Minister must have regard to New Zealand’s international obligations when making a recommendation relating to a regulation for the purposes set out in subsection (1)﻿(a) to (e). The Minister must, before making a recommendation for the purpose set out in subsection (1)﻿(c) that applies in section 82, be satisfied that a class of business is not broader than is reasonably necessary to manage risks to national security or public order. Regulations made under subsection (1)﻿(c) may prescribe a class of business using 1 or more of the following methods: minimum criteria for a business to be a strategically important business (for example, minimum capacity of a generator):  the geographic area in which the business is located or provides services: any other circumstances in which the business must operate. A call-in transaction that has been given effect to in contravention of section 85 or a prohibition order— is not an illegal contract for the purposes of subpart 5 of Part 2 of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017; and is not void only because the transaction has been given effect to without a direction notice or because giving effect to the overseas investment in contravention of a prohibition order is an offence. The Minister must publish, on an Internet site maintained by or for the regulator, notice of— a decision about whether or not to decline consent to a transaction of national interest under section 20C: a decision to take a risk management action. However, subsection (1)﻿(b) does not apply if the risk management action is a direction order referred to in section 88(1)﻿(a) (which relates to transactions in respect of which no conditions are imposed). The notice must include a summary of the decision made and the reasons for that decision. However, the Minister may defer or dispense with publication (in whole or in part) if the Minister is satisfied on reasonable grounds that good reason for withholding the publication would exist under the Official Information Act 1982. This section makes changes to Part 3 (as inserted by section 52). Replace section 81(1) with: The purpose of this Part is to manage significant national security and public order risks associated with transactions by overseas persons. In Part 3, replace the subpart 1 heading with: Replace section 82 with: A call-in transaction is a transaction by an overseas person or an associate of an overseas person that— is an overseas investment in SIB assets; but does not require consent (see section 10). An overseas investment in SIB assets is— the acquisition by an overseas person, or an associate of an overseas person, of rights or interests in securities of a person (A) who is (directly or indirectly) carrying on a SIB if,— in the case of a SIB that is a media business with significant impact, as a result of the acquisition the overseas person or the associate (either alone or together with its associates) has a more than 25% ownership or control interest in A; or in the case of A being a listed issuer that is not carrying on a media business with significant impact, as a result of the acquisition the overseas person or the associate (either alone or together with its associates) has 1 or more of the following: a beneficial entitlement to, or a beneficial interest in, 10% or more of A’s securities: the right to exercise or control the exercise of 10% or more of the voting power at a meeting of A: disproportionate access to or control of A; or in any other case, as a result of the acquisition the overseas person or the associate (either alone or together with its associates) has any ownership or control interest in A; or the acquisition by the overseas person or the associate of property (including goodwill and other intangible assets) in New Zealand used in carrying on a SIB. For the purposes of subsection (2)﻿(a)﻿(ii)﻿(C), a person has disproportionate access to or control of A if the person has 1 or more of the following: access to— information that would not otherwise be available to the person, but that is information that is material to an assessment of the value of shares or other financial products issued by A or a related company; or sensitive information held by A or its subsidiaries: membership or observer rights on the governing body of A: the power to control the composition of 10% or more of the governing body of A: any involvement, other than through the voting of securities, in the substantive decision making of A regarding— research, development, production, or maintenance of military or dual-use technology or sensitive information; or the use of, or access to, the assets of A; or the supply of goods or services to an intelligence or security agency. Replace section 84(1) with: The Minister must review a call-in transaction that is notified under section 85 or 86. Replace section 84(3) with: The Minister may review any other call-in transaction. Replace section 85 with: This section applies to a call-in transaction relating to a SIB that is— a business that researches, develops, produces, or maintains military or dual-use technology; or a critical direct supplier. Each overseas person or associate making the overseas investment in SIB assets must notify the regulator before giving effect to the call-in transaction. A call-in transaction must not be given effect to unless the Minister makes a direction order in relation to that transaction. However, in the case of an overseas person or associate investing in an unpublished CDS,— a notice under subsection (2) must be given before the date of giving effect to the call-in transaction or on a later date that may be set out in regulations; and that person does not breach subsection (2) if the reason the person fails to give the notice is that the person had not received a notice under section 20E. A person who fails to comply with this section does not commit an offence under section 45. Replace section 86 with: This section applies to a call-in transaction that is not a call-in transaction of a kind referred to in section 85. Any overseas person or associate making the overseas investment in SIB assets may notify the regulator of a call-in transaction at any time before the date set out in regulations. In section 87, replace “section 85” with “section 85 or 86” in each place. In section 87(1)﻿(c), replace “section 85(1)” with “section 85(2) or 86(2)”. Replace section 88(1) to (4) with: The Minister may give a direction order to a relevant acquirer, following a review of a call-in transaction, requiring compliance with the conditions of the order if the call-in transaction is or has been given effect to. It is a condition of every direction order, whether or not it is stated in the order, that the relevant acquirer must not, in relation to the SIB, act or omit to act with a purpose or an intention of adversely affecting national security or public order. A direction order is subject to any other conditions (if any) that the Minister thinks appropriate to manage the risks to national security or public order posed by the transaction.  The Minister may impose other conditions only if the Minister considers that the call-in transaction gives rise, or is likely to give rise, to a significant risk to national security or public order. When imposing other conditions, the Minister must have regard to New Zealand’s international obligations. In section 90(a), after “section 85”, insert “or 86” in each place. Replace section 91(2) with: Sections 88(2), (3), and (5) and 89 apply to an interim direction order as if it were a direction order. In section 6(1), definition of SIB, or strategically important business, after paragraph (i), insert: in section 82(2) (definition of overseas investment in SIB assets), a business of a class set out in regulations that develops, produces, maintains, or otherwise has access to sensitive information In section 46(1)﻿(ab), after “section 85”, insert “or 86”. In Schedule 1AA, clause 5(1) and (2), replace “interest” with “estate or interest”. In Schedule 1AA, after Part 2, insert the Parts 3 and 4 set out in the Schedule of this Act. In Schedule 2, clause 2, definition of relevant interest, paragraphs (a) and (b), replace “interest” with “estate or interest”. In Schedule 2, clause 17(3)﻿(b), replace “25% or more” with “more than 25%”. In Schedule 2, clause 21(1)﻿(b), replace “an interest” with “an estate or interest”. In Schedule 3, repeal the cross-heading above clause 2. In Schedule 3, replace clause 2(1) with: A transaction does not require consent for the purposes of section 10(1)﻿(a) to the extent that it will result in an overseas investment in sensitive land if the estate or interest in land described in section 12(a) is a periodic lease. In Schedule 3, clause 3(1)﻿(a), replace “interest” with “estate or interest”. In Schedule 3, clause 6(5)﻿(b)﻿(i) and (ii), replace “25% or more” with “more than 25%”. In Schedule 3, clause 8(5)﻿(c), replace “25% or more” with “more than 25%”. This subpart amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009. After section 140(2)﻿(p), insert: the Overseas Investment Act 2005: This subpart amends the Fisheries Act 1996.

In section 57F(2)﻿(a), replace “25% or more” with “more than 25%”. After section 57G(g), insert: if the overseas investment in fishing quota is a transaction of national interest, the Minister has not declined consent to the transaction (see section 20C of the Overseas Investment Act 2005): Replace section 57G(a) to (e) with: the investor test is met: Repeal section 57G(2).  Repeal section 57I. This subpart amends the Tax Administration Act 1994. In Schedule 7, part C, subpart 1, after clause 39, insert: Section 18 does not prevent the Commissioner from disclosing sensitive revenue information to any officer or employee of the regulator under the Overseas Investment Act 2005 (the OIA) if the officer or employee is authorised by the regulator to receive the information and if the regulator has reasonable grounds to believe that the disclosure of that information is necessary for all or any of the following purposes: enabling the regulator to consider whether an investor meets the investor test under the OIA: managing national security and public order risks associated with transactions by overseas persons: any purpose set out in section 41(1A) of the OIA. Information provided for the purpose in subclause (1)﻿(a) may include, for example, information on tax defaults, tax-related penalties, and tax settlement agreements made with the Commissioner.  Section 18 does not prevent the regulator from disclosing sensitive revenue information to any officer or employee of an agency referred to in section 126(2) of the OIA, if the officer or employee is authorised by the agency to receive the information and the regulator has reasonable grounds to believe that the disclosure of that information is necessary for the purpose of managing national security and public order risks associated with transactions by overseas persons. Despite subclause (1), the Commissioner may disclose information to the regulator only where it is reasonable and practical to do so, the information is readily available, and it is not undesirable to disclose the information. In this Part,— 2020 Urgent Act means the Overseas Investment (Urgent Measures) Amendment Act 2020 commencement, in relation to a provision that is being inserted or amended by the 2020 Urgent Act, means the commencement of the insertion or amendment new, in relation to a provision of this Act, means the provision as it reads immediately after commencement new Act means this Act as it reads immediately after the relevant provision of the 2020 Urgent Act commenced old, in relation to a provision of this Act, means the provision as it read immediately before commencement old Act means this Act as it read immediately before the relevant provision of the 2020 Urgent Act commenced. Part 1 of this schedule applies when determining whether a transaction is entered into before commencement or on or after commencement (see clause 1(4) and (5)). This clause applies for the purposes of applying a provision of this Act that relates to— determining who are overseas persons, what are overseas investments in sensitive assets, and other matters in Part 1 of this Act; and determining when consent is required and the criteria for consent under subpart 1 of Part 2 of this Act; and  the making an applications for consent and for granting consent under subpart 2 of Part 2 of this Act. Except as provided in this Part, the new Act applies to— transactions entered into on or after commencement: applications received by the regulator on or after commencement, regardless of when the transaction is or was entered into: transactions entered into before commencement in respect of which this Act requires an application to be made on or after commencement (for example, for retrospective consent): any other matters that relate to events or circumstances on or after commencement. The requirement for consent does not apply to a transaction that meets all of the following requirements: the transaction has not been given effect to before commencement; and consent has not been granted before commencement; and the transaction would not require consent under the new Act or would be eligible for a standing consent under Part 4. In other cases, the old Act continues to apply.  A person who has been granted consent before commencement of section 7 of the 2020 Urgent Act (section 7 amended (who are overseas persons)), and who would have been entitled to the benefit of the standing consent granted by clause 31 (standing consent relating to New Zealand listed issuers and managed investment schemes), may apply to the regulator under section 27 for a variation of a consent granted to them while they were an overseas person.  To avoid doubt, this clause does not require a variation to be granted.  When applying new section 18A after commencement, the factors in new section 18A(4) apply to events (for example, convictions) before commencement in the same way as they apply to events after commencement. Time frames set under new section 37B do not apply to any functions, powers, duties, or services under this Act that first arose for exercise, performance, or provision in respect of a matter before commencement. The powers in subpart 3 of Part 2 of the new Act apply to any circumstances for which the powers are conferred, whether occurring before, on, or after commencement. The regulator may exercise a power under subpart 4 of Part 2 of the new Act in connection with any transaction, act, omission, or other matter, regardless of whether the transaction, act, omission, or other matter was entered into or otherwise occurred before, on, or after commencement. Except as provided in this Part,— subpart 5 of Part 2 of the old Act continues to apply in relation to contraventions, or alleged contraventions, of this Act or the regulations that occurred before commencement; and  subpart 5 of Part 2 of the new Act applies to contraventions, or alleged contraventions, of this Act or the regulations that occur on or after commencement. However, the following apply to contraventions, or alleged contraventions, of this Act or the regulations, whether occurring before, on, or after commencement: new sections 46A to 46E (enforceable undertakings):  new sections 51AAA to 51AAE (injunctions, etc). Regulations that are made under an old provision, and in force immediately before commencement, continue in force until revoked as if made under the new Act. Exemptions that are granted under an old provision, and in force immediately before commencement, continue in force until revoked as if made under the new Act. Subpart 1 of Part 3 applies only to transactions entered into on or after commencement. Subpart 1 of Part 3 does not apply to transactions that would have required consent under the old Act but that would not require consent under the new Act. Subpart 1 of Part 3 does not apply to transactions in respect of which a standing consent applies under Part 4. A notification may be given under new subpart 1 of Part 3 early, that is, at any time before the commencement of section 52 or 53 of the 2020 Urgent Act. This Part applies to matters under sections 56 to 58B of the Fisheries Act 1996 in the same way as it applies to similar matters under the rest of this Act.  The Governor-General may, by Order in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister, make regulations for the purpose of providing that, subject to any conditions stated in the regulations, specified provisions of this Act do not apply, or continue to apply or apply with modifications or additions, or both, during the whole or any part of the transitional implementation period ending on the 1-year date. The Minister must not recommend the making of regulations under this section unless the Minister is satisfied that the regulations— are necessary or desirable for the orderly implementation of the 2020 Urgent Act; and are consistent with the intended purpose of the specified provisions. This clause is repealed on the close of the 1-year date. Any regulations made under this section that are in force on the 1-year date are revoked on the close of that day.  In this section,— 1-year date means the date that is 1 year after the date on which this clause comes into force specified provisions of the Act means any specified provisions of this Act to the extent that they are inserted, amended, or otherwise affected by the 2020 Urgent Act (including definitions and any transitional provisions in this schedule). This clause is repealed on the 42nd day after the date on which the Overseas Investment Amendment Act (No 3) 2020 receives the Royal assent. The Minister must review, at intervals that are no more than 90 days apart, whether the effects of the emergency continue to justify the emergency notification regime continuing in place.  In doing so, the Minister must have regard to the following: the economic, social, and other effects of the emergency in New Zealand: any risks to New Zealand’s national interest associated with transactions by overseas persons: New Zealand’s international relations and international obligations. If the Minister is not satisfied that the emergency notification regime should continue, the Minister must recommend to the Governor-General the commencement of section 53 of the Overseas Investment (Urgent Measures) Amendment Act 2020 (replacement of emergency notification regime with more permanent call-in regime). The purpose of this Part is to facilitate streamlined assessment criteria for certain lower-risk transactions that are entered into during the epidemic period.  This Part contains standing consents that apply to certain lower-risk transactions that are entered into during the epidemic period.  The consents are given on a class-by-class basis, due to the difficulties caused by COVID-19. As a result of these consents, no application needs to be made for a consent.  In this Part,— 2020 Urgent Act means the Overseas Investment (Urgent Measures) Amendment Act 2020 epidemic period means the period commencing with the commencement of this Part and ending with the date that is the 42nd day after the date on which the Overseas Investment Amendment Bill (No 3) receives the Royal assent new, in relation to a provision, means the provision in the form it was introduced into Parliament, as proposed to be amended or inserted by the Overseas Investment Amendment Bill (No 3). Other terms have the same meaning as in clause 14.  Part 1 of this schedule applies when determining whether a transaction is entered into during the epidemic period (see clause 1(4) and (5)). Consent is granted in respect of all transactions entered into during the epidemic period that would not require consent if new sections 7 and 12(1)﻿(b) and (2) of this Act had been enacted. Consent is granted in respect of all transactions entered into during the epidemic period by managed investment schemes that meet all of the following requirements:  the managed investment scheme is a listed issuer: the managed investment scheme is established under New Zealand law: both— 50% or less of the value of the managed investment products in the managed investment scheme is invested on behalf of overseas persons; and 25% or less of the managed investment products in the managed investment scheme that entitle holders to vote are beneficially owned by or on behalf of overseas persons who each beneficially own 10% or more of those products (alone or together with their associates). Terms used in this clause have the same meanings as in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 unless otherwise defined in this Act. The consent is granted unconditionally.  Consent is granted in respect of all transactions entered into during the epidemic period, to the extent a transaction is an overseas investment in sensitive land, that would not require consent if new Schedule 1 of this Act had been enacted. The consent is granted unconditionally.  Section 16 applies to transactions entered into during the epidemic period, to the extent a transaction is an overseas investment in sensitive land, as if new Schedule 1 of this Act had been enacted. Consent is granted in respect of all transactions entered into during the epidemic period, for the purposes of section 10(1)﻿(b) of this Act, to the extent that giving effect to the transaction has the effect of a transfer of an interest or right that is solely an interest in or right to be paid money that has been deposited with or lent to, or is otherwise owing by, any person.  However, this clause does not apply if the interest or right is convertible into a security within paragraphs (a) to (d) of the definition of security in section 6(1). The consent is granted unconditionally.  See clause 24, which provides, in effect, that a standing consent also exempts the transaction from subpart 1 of Part 3 (which relates to call-in transactions). The following provisions do not apply to standing consents under this Part: section 26 (Minister may revoke consent in case of fraud):  sections 27 (consent may be varied by agreement) and 27A (consent holder may apply for new consent): section 54 (address for service): any provisions that impose automatic conditions. This Part does not affect standing consents granted under Schedule 4 and that schedule does not affect standing consents granted by this Part.

This section overrides sections 18A(3), 19(1) and (2), and 24. The existence of a temporary reduction determination does not prevent the amendment or replacement of an original determination in accordance with the enactment under which the original determination was made. If the original determination to which a temporary reduction determination applies is amended or replaced, the Authority may amend the temporary reduction determination to specify— the replacement determination to which the temporary reduction determination applies: the adjusted remuneration payable (which must implement a percentage adjustment that is the same as the percentage adjustment that was made when the temporary reduction determination came into force). Subsection (8) applies in addition to section 19(4). This section and Schedule 4A are repealed on 31 January 2021. After Schedule 4, insert the Schedule 4A set out in the Schedule of this Act.

These regulations are the Companies (COVID-19—Business Debt Hibernation) Regulations 2020. These regulations come into force on 24 December 2020. In these regulations, unless the context otherwise requires,— BDH means business debt hibernation under Schedule 13 entity means an entity to which Schedule 13 applies (see clause 3 of that schedule) Schedule 13 means Schedule 13 of the Companies Act 1993. For the purposes of these regulations, an entity is in BDH if the protections in Part 5 of Schedule 13 apply to the entity (see clause 4(4) of that schedule). This regulation prescribes, for the purposes of clause 3(3)﻿(b) of Schedule 13, 31 October 2021 as the last date on which an entity may enter into BDH. This regulation prescribes 31 July 2022 as the date for the purposes of clause 5(2)﻿(c) of Schedule 13 for all entities other than entities that are in BDH on the date that this regulation comes into force. These regulations are revoked on the close of 31 May 2022. These regulations, which come into force on 24 December 2020, prescribe 2 dates for the purposes of Schedule 13 of the Companies Act 1993 (Schedule 13). Schedule 13 enables certain entities affected by COVID-19 to enter into business debt hibernation (BDH). Entities may now enter into BDH under that schedule up to the close of 31 October 2021 (see regulation 4). The date prescribed for the purposes of clause 5(2)﻿(c) of Schedule 13 (see regulation 5) does not apply for entities that are in BDH on 24 December 2020. For those entities, 30 September 2021 continues to apply for those purposes (see clauses 5(3) and 17 of Schedule 13). Note that clause 8 of Schedule 13 provides that an entity may not enter into BDH more than once (unless a circumstance in clause 8(3) of that schedule applies). Regulation 6 revokes these regulations on the close of 31 May 2022, which is when section 395A(3) of the Companies Act 1993 repeals Schedule 13.

2020-09-25T09:53:48,Contract and Commercial Law (COVID-19—Extension of Modification Relating to Powers of Attorney) Order 2020," This order is made under section 218B(3) of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017— on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council; and on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs made in accordance with section 218C(1) of that Act. This order is the Contract and Commercial Law (COVID-19—Extension of Modification Relating to Powers of Attorney) Order 2020. This order comes into force on 15 November 2020. In this order,— Act means the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017 initial period has the meaning set out in section 218B(6) of the Act. The modification in section 218A(1) of the Act applies for a further period of 6 months that starts immediately after the expiry of the initial period. This order is revoked on the close of 30 June 2021. This order, which comes into force on 15 November 2020, relates to section 218A(1) of the Contract and Commercial Law Act 2017 (the Act). That section temporarily applies subpart 3 of Part 4 of the Act (relating to the application of legal requirements to electronic transactions) to deeds that create powers of attorney in connection with security interests and that are made during a specified period. That period is due to expire on the close of 15 November 2020. This order extends that period by 6 months, to the close of 15 May 2021. Note that section 218B(5) of the Act allows for an order to reduce this extension if the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs (the Ministers) are satisfied that the modification in section 218A(1) (the modification) is no longer necessary or desirable to address the effects of COVID-19 (see section 218C(4) of the Act). The period for which the modification applies cannot be further extended by Order in Council (see section 218B(4) of the Act). Clause 5 revokes this order on the close of 30 June 2021, which is the same date and time that section 218D of the Act repeals section 218A. The Ministers are satisfied that the extension to the application of the modification set out in this order is desirable to address the effects of COVID-19, and is no longer than is reasonably necessary to address those effects, because it guards against the effects of, or a re-escalation to, alert level 3 or 4. If the modification expires, a sudden change in alert level, as happened in August in Auckland, could create a technical legal barrier to businesses getting financial support from lenders. This support could be vital to a business remaining viable during any alert level 3 or 4 period.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0259/latest/whole.html
2020-09-10T10:27:23,COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. This order is made in accordance with sections 9 and 11, and clause 1 of Schedule 1, of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 by the Minister of Health. This order is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020. This order comes into force at 11.59 pm on 22 June 2020. The purpose of this order is to prevent, and limit the risk of, the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 by putting in place isolation and quarantine requirements for persons arriving in New Zealand by air. In this order, unless the context otherwise requires,— chief executive of MBIE means the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment Director-General has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Health Act 1956 excluded arrival means any of the following persons: any aircraft pilots or flight crew members: any maritime crew members transferring to a ship (within the meaning of the Health Act 1956) immediately after their arrival in New Zealand: any medical attendants assisting with medical air transfers: any person designated by the Director-General as critical to providing services to assist with the response to COVID-19: any person who is entitled to any immunity from jurisdiction by or under— the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968 (other than a person referred to in section 10D(2)﻿(d) of that Act) or the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1971; or any order under either of those Acts: any person who is a member of the New Zealand Defence Force and returning from service outside of New Zealand fellow resident, of any person (person A), means another person who is isolated or quarantined together with person A health practitioner has the same meaning as in section 5(1) of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 high risk facility means a facility designated by a medical officer of health for the purposes of detaining people in a way appropriate for people with a high risk of transmitting COVID-19 low risk facility means a facility designated by a medical officer of health for the purposes of detaining people in a way appropriate for people with a low risk of transmitting COVID-19 low risk indicators has the meaning given in subclause (2) physical distancing, from other persons, means remaining at least 2 metres away from those other persons place of isolation or quarantine, of a person, means the person’s place of isolation or quarantine as determined under clause 7(5) security designated aerodrome has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1990. For the purposes of this order, a person meets the low risk indicators if— the person submits to a medical test for COVID-19 and the result of that test is negative; and any other medical tests or information relating to the person indicate that the person is at low risk of having or transmitting COVID-19. Subclause (2)﻿(a) does not apply in relation to a person who has particular physical or other needs that a medical officer of health or health protection officer determines would make it inappropriate for the person to undertake the medical test. The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. This order applies throughout New Zealand. Every person arriving in New Zealand by air (other than excluded arrivals) must— report for, and submit to, medical examination and testing, as soon as practicable after their arrival, at the security designated aerodrome at which they arrive; and be isolated or quarantined for the required period— by remaining throughout that period at a place determined to be their place of isolation or quarantine (except as permitted under clause 8); and by maintaining physical distancing (to the greatest extent practicable) throughout that period from all other persons in or outside the place (including all other persons who are isolated or quarantined at the place, but not including fellow residents); and further report for, and submit to, medical examination and testing, as directed by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer, at any time during their required period of isolation or quarantine; and wear personal protective equipment as directed by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer. Medical examination and testing under this clause may only involve testing for temperatures, seeking information on symptoms, carrying out chest auscultation, and taking mouth or nose swabs (or both), as required to test for COVID-19. The required period of isolation or quarantine of a person under this clause is— the period ending 14 days after the start date if the chief executive of MBIE is satisfied (as close as is reasonably practicable to the end of that period and on the basis of the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner) that the person meets the low risk indicators; or  any longer period needed to satisfy the chief executive of MBIE (on the basis of the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner) that the person meets the low risk indicators, but no longer than the period ending 28 days after the start date. The start date is the latest of the following: the date on which the person arrives in New Zealand: the date on which a fellow resident of the person joins the person at that person’s place of isolation or quarantine. A person’s place of isolation or quarantine under this clause is to be one of the following, as determined by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer: a high risk facility: a low risk facility: a place other than a high risk facility or low risk facility if necessary due to the particular physical or other needs of the person. For the purposes of clause 7(1)﻿(b)﻿(i), a person is permitted to leave their place of isolation or quarantine— for the purposes of engaging in outdoor exercise of a class, and in accordance with any conditions, authorised by the chief executive of MBIE; or if it is necessary for the person to do so, as a matter of emergency, to preserve their own or any other person’s life or safety; or if it is necessary for the person to do so to access any court or tribunal; or if the chief executive of MBIE is satisfied, on the basis of the advice of a medical officer of health or a health protection officer, that it is necessary for the person to do so— to access medical services; or to move to another place of isolation or quarantine (including, for example, to move to another place for temporary or emergency care while the person is sick); or  if the person is required to do so under Part 4 of the Health Act 1956; or  if the person is required to move to another place of isolation or quarantine in compliance with— a court order; or any other obligations imposed by or under any enactment that are related to the detention of the person (for example, a direction of the New Zealand Parole Board or a probation officer); or to assist or accompany a child or other person to travel to or from a place under any of paragraphs (b) to (h), but only if the person is a fellow resident of the child or other person and is authorised to do so by the chief executive of MBIE. In determining whether or not to authorise a person to leave under subclause (1)﻿(i), the chief executive of MBIE must take into account the advice of a medical officer of health or a health protection officer. For the purposes of clause 7(1)﻿(b)﻿(i), a person is also permitted to leave their place of isolation or quarantine for any exceptional reason, as authorised by the chief executive of MBIE (with or without conditions). Before authorising a person to leave under subclause (2), the chief executive of MBIE must— take into account any effect that a medical officer of health advises the person’s leaving the place might have on the risk of an outbreak or the spread of COVID-19; and be satisfied, on the basis of the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner, that the person meets the low risk indicators; and be satisfied that the person will comply with any conditions of the authorisation. A caregiver of a child may, with the authorisation of the chief executive of MBIE, enter the child’s place of isolation or quarantine to care for the child. If a caregiver enters the child’s place of isolation or quarantine to care for the child,— the caregiver must be isolated or quarantined together with the child (and is therefore a fellow resident of the child); and the provisions of this order (except for clause 7(1)﻿(a)) apply in relation to the caregiver in the same way as they apply in relation to any other person who is required to be isolated or quarantined under this order. The following orders are revoked: the order made on 9 April 2020 under section 70(1)﻿(e), (ea), and (f) of the Health Act 1956; and the order made on 8 May 2020 under section 70 of the Health Act 1956 amending and extending that order.

They are also not exempt from clause 8(3) if a medical officer of health determines (on the basis of information brought to that officer’s attention) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that, within the 7 days immediately before that arrival and while outside New Zealand, the aircrew member has failed to meet 1 or more of the key safety standards. An aircrew member meets the key safety standards if, while outside New Zealand, they— wear personal protective equipment at all times (to the greatest extent practicable)— while working in a role involving direct interaction with aircraft passengers; or while in any place other than on an aircraft or in a specified room at any accommodation where the aircrew member is staying; and maintain physical distancing from all other persons (to the greatest extent practicable) other than— persons on an aircraft on which the crew member is working; or fellow crew members of the aircrew member; and meet the overseas airside condition after arriving in a country outside New Zealand if— not staying in any accommodation before departing the country; or staying in any accommodation on the airside of an airport before departing the country; and travel as directly as practicable to any accommodation where they are staying; and meet the self-isolation standards at that accommodation until they are required to travel from it to carry out their duties as an aircrew member. An aircrew member meets the self-isolation standards if— they do not leave their allocated room at any accommodation where they are staying except— to preserve or protect their own or another person’s life, health, or safety in an emergency; or to access medical services; or to visit a specified room at that accommodation; and they do not permit any other persons to enter their allocated room except— for medical, emergency, or law enforcement purposes; or fellow crew members of the aircrew member. In this clause,— fellow crew member, of an aircrew member in a country outside New Zealand, means a person who is identified (along with the aircrew member) as being a crew member on the crew manifest for the aircraft on which both arrive in that country specified room, at the accommodation where an aircrew member is staying, means— the aircrew member’s allocated room at the accommodation; or the allocated room, at the accommodation, of a fellow crew member of the aircrew member. The following persons arriving by air in New Zealand are exempt from clause 8 if they meet the airside condition: any person assisting, as a medical attendant, with a medical air transfer to New Zealand: any person arriving in New Zealand to assist, as a medical attendant, with a medical transfer from New Zealand.

In clause 10(2)﻿(a), replace “:” with “; or”. Replace clause 10(3) with: However, if another person is designated as their fellow resident, and the fellow resident’s start time under subclause (2) is a later start time, the person’s start time becomes that later start time. See clause 15(2)﻿(c) in relation to the start time of caregivers. Replace clause 11(3) with: Subclause (4) applies to a person who is scheduled to depart New Zealand during the period under clause 10(1) (a scheduled departer), other than— an aircrew member; or a person who assisted, or is to assist, as a medical attendant as described by subclause (4A)﻿(b). After clause 11(4), insert: Subclause (4B) applies to a scheduled departer who is not ordinarily resident in New Zealand and who— is an aircrew member; or arrived in New Zealand by air— while assisting, as a medical attendant, with a medical air transfer to New Zealand; or to assist, as a medical attendant, with a medical air transfer from New Zealand. Their period of isolation or quarantine ends— when they are required to travel in order to carry out their duties as an aircrew member, or a medical attendant, on an aircraft that is scheduled for departure; or if paragraph (a) does not apply, 12 hours before their scheduled departure from New Zealand, as long as they leave their place of isolation or quarantine only to travel to the place of departure and depart accordingly. A scheduled departer whose period of isolation or quarantine ends under subclause (4) or (4B) must comply with any directions of the chief executive of MBIE (given on the advice of a medical officer of health or a health protection officer) relating to the travel of the scheduled departer to the place of departure.

After clause 15A, insert: This Part applies to a person (a relevant worker) who— is required by the Air Border Order to be isolated or quarantined in accordance with this order; and is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and is a relevant crew member or a relevant medical attendant. In this clause,— Air Border Order means the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) 2020 relevant crew member means an aircrew member who travelled on a higher-risk route (within the meaning of the Air Border Order) within the 7 days immediately before their arrival by air in New Zealand relevant medical attendant means a person who, on arrival by air in New Zealand,— was assisting, as a medical attendant, with a medical air transfer to New Zealand; or was returning from assisting, as a medical attendant, with a medical air transfer from New Zealand. Before departing the security designated aerodrome at which they arrive in New Zealand, a relevant worker must notify the Ministry of Health, in the manner approved by the Director-General, of— the address of the residence or other accommodation that they intend to be their place of self-isolation; and an email address and telephone number at which they may be contacted. In this clause, security designated aerodrome has the meaning given by section 2(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1990. A relevant worker must comply with the requirements set out in this clause throughout their period of self-isolation. They must remain at the accommodation notified to the Ministry of Health as their place of self-isolation, except as permitted by this Part. They must maintain physical distancing (to the greatest extent practicable) from every person in or outside their place of self-isolation. They must not permit any other person to enter their accommodation unless— the place is a residence at which the other person lives; or the entry is for the purposes of preserving or protecting the relevant worker’s or another person’s life, health, or safety in an emergency. They must wear personal protective equipment at all times (to the greatest extent practicable) when outside their place of self-isolation. A relevant worker’s period of self-isolation is the period— commencing as soon as practicable after they arrive in New Zealand; and ending when they receive a negative result from the medical examination and testing they are required to undergo by this Part (but ending no later than 14 days after the time and date of their arrival in New Zealand). A relevant worker must report for, and undergo, medical examination and testing for COVID-19 after at least 48 hours have passed since the time and date of their arrival in New Zealand. That medical examination and testing must involve taking nose swabs or mouth swabs (or both). A relevant worker is permitted to leave the accommodation notified to the Ministry of Health as their place of self-isolation— to report for, and undergo, medical examination required by this Part; or if they need to leave to preserve or protect their own or another person’s life, health, or safety in an emergency; or to access medical services; or to attend any court, tribunal, New Zealand Parole Board hearing, or other judicial institution that they are required or permitted to attend by that institution; or if a medical officer of health is satisfied that they need to leave to move to another place for isolation or quarantine (for example, for temporary or emergency care while they are sick); or if they are required to move to another place for isolation or quarantine by— a court order; or any other obligation imposed by or under an enactment. This Part amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Required Testing) Order 2020. In clause 4, insert in their appropriate alphabetical order: aircrew member means any of the following persons: cabin crew who— are ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and work on an international flight on or after 19 October 2020: other persons who— are ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and are identified as crew members on a crew manifest for an aircraft that has travelled internationally on or after 19 October 2020; and have an international layover (whether airside or landside) during that travel: cabin crew who, on or after 19 October 2020, travel on a domestic flight within New Zealand that carries international arriving or international transiting passengers who have not yet completed isolation or quarantine at a managed isolation or quarantine facility landside, in relation to an affected airport, means any part of the affected airport that is not airside After clause 8(4), insert: An aircrew member is not required to undergo testing and medical examination under clause 7 if, during an applicable testing period, the aircrew member is required to be tested and isolated or quarantined under another COVID-19 order during that period. In Schedule 2, after Part 4, insert: This order comes into force at 11.59 pm on 4 October 2020. It makes amendments, mainly concerning aircrew members and certain medical attendants, to the following orders: the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) 2020 (the Air Border Order): the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine) Order 2020 (the Isolation and Quarantine Order): the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Required Testing) Order 2020 (the Required Testing Order). Part 1 of this order amends the Air Border Order. Currently, aircrew members and certain medical attendants arriving in New Zealand by air are exempt from all of the requirements that are generally imposed by clause 8 of that order on other persons arriving in New Zealand by air. Those requirements include requirements— to report for and undergo medical examination and testing at the airport at which they arrive; and to be isolated or quarantined (commencing as soon as practicable after arrival) in accordance with the Isolation and Quarantine Order. Aircrew members and relevant medical attendants arriving in New Zealand by air will continue to be exempt from all of the requirements if, until they depart New Zealand, they remain on the airside of— the airport at which they arrive in New Zealand; and any other airport through which they transit. Generally, aircrew members not remaining on the airside of those airports, but who are ordinarily resident in New Zealand, will continue to be exempt from the requirement to be isolated or quarantined in accordance with the Isolation and Quarantine Order. However, they will not be exempt from that requirement if,— within the 7 days immediately before they arrive in New Zealand, they have travelled on an international route of travel that is designated by the Director-General of Health as a higher-risk route; or a medical officer of health determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that, within the 7 days immediately before they arrive in New Zealand and while outside New Zealand, they have failed to meet certain key safety standards. Those key safety standards include standards relating to— wearing personal protective equipment; and maintaining physical distancing; and self-isolating at any accommodation at which they stay while outside New Zealand. Part 2 of this order amends the Isolation and Quarantine Order. The amendments mainly concern the aircrew members and medical attendants who are required to be isolated or quarantined because of the amendments made to the Air Border Order by Part 1. A person’s period of isolation or quarantine under the Isolation and Quarantine Order generally lasts 14 days, so long as they meet certain low-risk indicators by then. However, the period for aircrew members, and relevant medical attendants, who are not ordinarily resident in New Zealand will generally end earlier to allow for their scheduled departure from New Zealand (for example, when they are required to travel in order to carry out their duties on an aircraft scheduled for departure). Aircrew members who are ordinarily resident in New Zealand and travelled on a higher-risk route within the 7 days before their arrival in New Zealand will be required to self-isolate at accommodation notified to the Ministry of Health as their place of self-isolation. Medical attendants ordinarily resident in New Zealand will also be required to self-isolate at notified accommodation. In both cases, their period of self-isolation will commence as soon as practicable after they arrive in New Zealand and end when they receive a negative result following medical examination and testing for COVID-19 (but no later than 14 days after that arrival). They must report for, and undergo, that medical examination and testing after at least 48 hours have passed since their arrival in New Zealand. Aircrew members who are ordinarily resident in New Zealand, and are required to be isolated or quarantined because of a determination under the Air Border Order relating to their failure to meet key safety standards, will generally be required to do so in a managed isolation or quarantine facility for at least 14 days. The Isolation and Quarantine Order is also amended to make changes relating to fellow residents at places of isolation or quarantine. The main effect of persons being fellow residents at those places is that they are not required to maintain physical distancing from each other while in isolation or quarantine. The amendments— ensure that fellow residents need not be isolated or quarantined together in the same room; and enable a site manager at a managed isolation or quarantine facility to designate a person as a fellow resident of another person at the facility (for example, if they were fellow travellers when they arrived in New Zealand). Part 3 of this order amends the Required Testing Order. The amendments— amend clause 4 to insert new definitions of aircrew member and landside; and add new Part 5 to the table in Schedule 2, which specifies groups of affected persons who must report for and undergo testing for COVID-19, to extend the requirements to aircrew members; and add new clause 8(5), which exempts an aircrew member from the requirements if, during the applicable testing period, the aircrew member is required to be tested and isolated or quarantined under another COVID-19 order. This order must be approved by a resolution of the House of Representatives before the end of the relevant period described in section 16(2) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. If that does not happen, the order is revoked at the end of that period.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0273/latest/whole.html
2020-06-09T18:54:25,COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level 2) Order 2020," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. This order is made in accordance with sections 9 and 11 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 by the Minister of Health. This order is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level 2) Order 2020. This order comes into force at 12.01 am on 14 May 2020. The purpose of this order is to prevent, and limit the risk of, the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 by putting in place obligations in relation to businesses and services, and gatherings. In this order,— businesses and services— includes (except to the extent set out in paragraph (b))— voluntary and not-for-profit services; and both public sector and private sector businesses and services; and businesses and services that provide space for other businesses and services to operate within, such as shopping malls and marketplaces; and businesses and services that provide facilities or venues for events or activities if people pay to attend the event or participate in the activities or pay to hire the facility or venue; and the playing of sports professionally or semi-professionally; but does not include— voluntary or not-for-profit sporting, recreational, social, or cultural activities; or households carrying out family activities in their household unit; or faith-based gatherings; or community club activities (except activities that occur at the same time and place as services provided under a club licence under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012) customer or client includes any non-paying customer or client defined space— means any single indoor space or outdoor space (see subclause (2)); and if there is more than 1 space in any premises, means a space described in paragraph (a) for which there are systems and processes in operation that ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that persons using the space (other than workers) do not intermingle at a distance closer than 2 metres with other persons using, entering, or leaving the premises keep records to enable contact tracing means collecting and maintaining the following information: a person’s full name:  an effective means of communicating with them (for example, an active phone number or email address): the date on which, and the times at which, the person arrived and left the relevant place organiser of a social gathering means a person who arranges or organises the social gathering person in control, in relation to a defined space or premises,— means a person who manages or controls the defined space or premises; and includes— any occupier of the defined space or premises; and if a facility or venue of a business or service is hired for an event or activity, that business or service social gathering has the meaning given in clause 15 worker— means, in the context of a business or service that is required to comply with clauses 10 to 13, any person who carries out work in any capacity for that business or service (whether paid or unpaid); and to avoid doubt, includes professional and semi-professional sports players workplace has the same meaning as in section 20 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. For the purpose of the definition of defined space in subclause (1),— an indoor space or outdoor space is a single space if there are walls (whether permanent or temporary) that substantially divide that space from other spaces: an outdoor space is also a single space if there is at least 2 metres between all people in that space and any other people (outside that space). The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. This order applies to all areas of New Zealand. If the Director-General of Health makes a section 11 order under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 that applies only within the boundaries of a single territorial authority district, that order applies (rather than this order) to the extent of any inconsistency. To the extent that people intermingle in the workplace of a business or service, clauses 8 and 10 to 13 govern the activities of those people. In all other circumstances, people must— stay, to the greatest extent practicable, 2 metres apart (see clause 15(1)﻿(b)﻿(i)); or comply with the requirements relating to social gatherings in clauses 8, 16, and 17. This clause is a guide only to the general scheme of the requirements that apply to people. A person (person A) who enters a workplace of a business or service, uses its services, or carries out work for the business or service must comply with the requirements described in subclause (2) to the extent that they— apply to the business or service in relation to person A; and are notified to, or brought to the attention of, person A. The requirements referred to in subclause (1) are the following (as applied by clause 9): the physical distancing requirements in clauses 10(2)﻿(a) and (b) and 11(2)﻿(a): the requirements in clauses 10(2)﻿(e) and 11(2)﻿(b) to keep records to enable contact tracing: the requirement in clause 12(2)﻿(b) to ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table except in limited circumstances. A person— must not participate in a social gathering that exceeds the number limit in clause 16(1); and must, if participating in a social gathering, comply with the requirements in clause 17 to enable contact tracing records to be kept. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. Any reference in clauses 8 or 10 to 13 to a requirement applying to a business or service must be read as a requirement that applies, in accordance with this clause, to the person who is carrying on the business or service. All businesses and services must comply, so far as is reasonably practicable, with— the general requirements in clause 10 or 11 (or both), to the extent applicable; and each of the specific additional requirements in clauses 12 and 13 to the extent that they apply to their activities. More than 1 business or service may operate in the same, or a shared, premises (for example, a shopping mall, a marketplace, or a cafe that operates in an office building) provided that each of those businesses and services is able to comply with all of the requirements in clauses 10 to 13 to the extent that they apply to them or their activities. However,— if there is a gathering of friends and whānau in the workplace at any 1 time,— those people need not comply with the physical distancing requirements in clause 10(2)﻿(b) or 11(2)﻿(a); and a business or service need not ensure that they do so: if the facility or venue of a business or service is hired for a social gathering, the business or service must comply with clauses 16 and 17 in relation to the customers or clients (instead of clauses 10 to 13). In this clause, gathering of friends and whānau means a group of customers or clients who confirm that they are, or whom it is otherwise reasonable to believe to be, a group of persons who all know each other and can identify each other for the purpose of contact tracing. This clause applies to all businesses and services (except to the extent that clause 11 applies to them). Businesses and services must— ensure that all people who enter the workplace or use its services remain 2 metres away from each other and from the workers (to the greatest extent practicable), except— to the extent that paragraph (b) applies; and  ensure that all workers who enter the workplace or carry out work for the business or service remain 1 metre away from each other (to the greatest extent practicable); and mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that the physical distancing requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) (or the specific physical distancing requirements in clauses 11 to 13 that apply instead) are not fully maintained; and  keep records to enable contact tracing of all workers who enter the workplace or carry out work for the business or service.  A breach of subclause (2) (as applied by clause 9) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. This clause— applies to— businesses and services to the extent that they largely have a consistent group of workers and usually have a fixed workplace, such as office workplaces and factories; and businesses and services to the extent that their customers or clients are members of the business or service, such as gyms; and public facilities that are located within a building or structure, such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums; and event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos; and businesses and services to the extent to which clauses 12 and 13 apply to them (despite paragraph (b)); and courts and tribunals; but does not apply to retail businesses, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway-food stores, and retail stores. The businesses and services and other entities to which this clause applies must— ensure that all people who enter the workplace, use its services, or carry out work for the business or service remain at least 1 metre away from each other (to the greatest extent practicable); and keep records to enable contact tracing of people who enter the workplace, use its services, or carry out work for the business or service; and if they are an event facility of the kind described in subclause (1)﻿(a)﻿(iv), permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time (not including workers); and mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that the physical distancing requirements in paragraph (a) (or the specific physical distancing requirements in clauses 12 and 13 that apply instead) are not fully maintained. A breach of subclause (2) (as applied by clause 9) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. This clause applies to the extent that customers or clients enter the workplace of a business or service and food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) to those customers or clients in that workplace, such as— a restaurant or cafe; or a soup kitchen or other place where food or drink is provided without charge. Businesses and services must— permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time; and ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food and drink except in on-licence premises or club licence premises; and ensure that adjacent tables are arranged so there is at least a 1-metre separation between the seated customers or clients at adjacent tables; and ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that only 1 worker serves at any table; and comply with clause 11(2)﻿(a) in relation to those customers and clients when they are not seated at the table; and otherwise comply with the requirements in clause 11(2) in relation to the activities to which this clause applies. Nothing in this clause applies to— accommodation services selling or providing food or drink for residents (including room service): businesses or services providing food or drink to their workers: vending machines that are located and used within a workplace: cinemas or theatres selling food or drink to customers or clients when they are seated inside the cinema or theatre. A breach of subclause (2) (as applied by clause 9) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. In this clause,— club licence premises means premises in which activities are undertaken under a licence under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 on-licence has the same meaning as in sections 14 to 16 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012.  This clause applies to the extent that a business or service cannot operate without physical contact, or close proximity, between people, such as massage and hairdressing services,  and professional or semi-professional sports. Businesses and services must— ensure that all people who enter the workplace or use its services remain at least 1 metre away from each other and from workers (to the greatest extent practicable), except to the extent that workers are required to have physical contact with, or close proximity to, people in order to carry out the activities of that business or service; and otherwise comply with the requirements in clause 11(2) in relation to the activities to which this clause applies. A breach of subclause (2) (as applied by clause 9) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020.  Nothing in this subpart prevents people from residing together in their home or place of residence. In this order, social gathering— means a group of people who are intermingling; but does not include— activities where people remain at least 2 metres away from each other to the greatest extent practicable (for example, activities carried out by people who are at a playground, beach, or park): activities that are undertaken at a business or service in compliance with clauses 10 to 13; but does include a gathering of people if— the gathering is held at the facilities or venue of a business or service that has been hired for the gathering; but the gathering is not held for the purpose of a business or service. A social gathering that exceeds 100 people in a defined space at any 1 time (the number limit) is prohibited. An organiser of a social gathering must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed, and is not likely to exceed, the number limit. A person in control of any premises, or of any defined space in any premises, in which a social gathering is held must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed, and is not likely to exceed, the number limit. Workers who are providing services in relation to a social gathering are not to be counted as part of the number limit. A breach of subclause (2) or (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. A social gathering in which the requirements in subclause (2) are not met is prohibited. The organiser of a social gathering, and the person in control of the defined space or premises in which a social gathering is held, must ensure that at least 1 of the following people keep records to enable contact tracing in relation to the social gathering: the organiser of the social gathering: the person in control of the defined space or premises where the gathering is held: a participant in the social gathering. Subclause (2) does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purposes of contact tracing, every other person who is a participant in the social gathering. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. Nothing in this order prevents any person from assisting in, or responding to, an emergency. Nothing in this order applies— to the provision of health services: to people using a service for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward that is contracted or funded by the Ministry of Education, local authorities, or Auckland Transport for the sole or primary purpose of transporting school children to and from school: to people using public transport services: to residential centres (including care and protection and youth justice residences), family homes, and group homes (including family group homes and community-based remand centres) that are approved or recognised for the time being by the Chief Executive of Oranga Tamariki as a place of care or treatment for the purposes of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989: within a corrections prison as defined in section 3(1) of the Corrections Act 2004 or any premises managed by or on behalf of the Department of Corrections: to custodial or detention services managed by the New Zealand Police, the Department of Corrections, or the Ministry of Justice, or within a courthouse: to the administration of sentences and orders by the Department of Corrections, or on its behalf, in accordance with the Corrections Act 2004: to people being transported for the purposes of the Department of Corrections and New Zealand Police fulfilling their purposes and performing their functions and duties: to the New Zealand Defence Force: to the New Zealand Police: to Fire and Emergency New Zealand. Nothing in this order applies to people who are at an education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services, provided that the education entity has systems and processes in place to— enable suitable contact tracing of people who enter the relevant workplaces, or deliver or use the relevant services; and mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that the physical distancing requirements in this order that would otherwise apply to the workplace or service are not fully maintained. Subclause (2) does not apply to— inter-school activities; or activities at (or connected with) an education entity that are attended by people who are otherwise not ordinarily at that education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services. In this clause,— education entity has the same meaning as in section 476B of the Education Act 1989 health service has the same meaning as in section 5(1) of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 public transport service has the same meaning as in section 5(1) of the Land Transport Management Act 2003, but includes air transport that is available to the public generally. The Minister may exempt any class of persons, businesses, or services from the application of any provision of this order or from the requirement to comply with any provision of this order if the Minister is satisfied that— the exemption is necessary or desirable in order to promote the purposes of the Act or the purposes of this order; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemption.

In clause 4, definition of businesses and services, replace paragraph (a)﻿(iv) with: businesses and services that provide facilities or venues for events or activities if people pay to attend the event or participate in the activities or pay to hire the facility or venue; and In clause 4, definition of businesses and services, after paragraph (b)﻿(ii), insert: faith-based gatherings; or community club activities (except activities that occur at the same time and place as services provided under a club licence under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012) In clause 4, insert in their appropriate alphabetical order: defined space— means any single indoor space or outdoor space (see subclause (2)); and if there is more than 1 space in any premises, means a space described in paragraph (a) for which there are systems and processes in operation that ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that persons using the space (other than workers) do not intermingle at a distance closer than 2 metres with other persons using, entering, or leaving the premises organiser of a social gathering means a person who arranges or organises the social gathering person in control, in relation to a defined space or premises,— means a person who manages or controls the defined space or premises; and includes— any occupier of the defined space or premises; and if a facility or venue of a business or service is hired for an event or activity, that business or service social gathering has the meaning given in clause 15 In clause 4, revoke the definitions of gathering of friends and whānau and household unit. In clause 4, definition of keep records to enable contact tracing, revoke paragraph (b). In clause 4, insert as subclause (2): For the purpose of the definition of defined space in subclause (1),— an indoor space or outdoor space is a single space if there are walls (whether permanent or temporary) that substantially divide that space from other spaces: an outdoor space is also a single space if there is at least 2 metres between all people in that space and any other people (outside that space). In clause 7(1), replace “clauses 10 to 13” with “clauses 8 and 10 to 13”. Replace clause 7(2)﻿(b) with: comply with the requirements relating to social gatherings in clauses 8, 16, and 17. Replace clauses 8 and 9 with: A person (person A) who enters a workplace of a business or service, uses its services, or carries out work for the business or service must comply with the requirements described in subclause (2) to the extent that they— apply to the business or service in relation to person A; and are notified to, or brought to the attention of, person A. The requirements referred to in subclause (1) are the following (as applied by clause 9): the physical distancing requirements in clauses 10(2)﻿(a) and (b) and 11(2)﻿(a): the requirements in clauses 10(2)﻿(e) and 11(2)﻿(b) to keep records to enable contact tracing: the requirement in clause 12(2)﻿(b) to ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table except in limited circumstances. A person— must not participate in a social gathering that exceeds the number limit in clause 16(1); and must, if participating in a social gathering, comply with the requirements in clause 17 to enable contact tracing records to be kept. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. Any reference in clauses 8 or 10 to 13 to a requirement applying to a business or service must be read as a requirement that applies, in accordance with this clause, to the person who is carrying on the business or service. All businesses and services must comply, so far as is reasonably practicable, with— the general requirements in clause 10 or 11 (or both), to the extent applicable; and each of the specific additional requirements in clauses 12 and 13 to the extent that they apply to their activities. More than 1 business or service may operate in the same, or a shared, premises (for example, a shopping mall, a marketplace, or a cafe that operates in an office building) provided that each of those businesses and services is able to comply with all of the requirements in clauses 10 to 13 to the extent that they apply to them or their activities. However,— if there is a gathering of friends and whānau in the workplace at any 1 time,— those people need not comply with the physical distancing requirements in clause 10(2)﻿(b) or 11(2)﻿(a); and a business or service need not ensure that they do so: if the facility or venue of a business or service is hired for a social gathering, the business or service must comply with clauses 16 and 17 in relation to the customers or clients (instead of clauses 10 to 13). In this clause, gathering of friends and whānau means a group of customers or clients who confirm that they are, or whom it is otherwise reasonable to believe to be, a group of persons who all know each other and can identify each other for the purpose of contact tracing. In clause 10(1), replace “businesses and services” with “businesses and services (except to the extent that clause 11 applies to them)”. Revoke clause 10(2)﻿(a)﻿(ii).

Replace clause 12(2) with: Businesses and services must— permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time; and ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food and drink except in on-licence premises or club licence premises; and ensure that adjacent tables are arranged so there is at least a 1-metre separation between the seated customers or clients at adjacent tables; and ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that only 1 worker serves at any table; and comply with clause 11(2)﻿(a) in relation to those customers and clients when they are not seated at the table; and otherwise comply with the requirements in clause 11(2) in relation to the activities to which this clause applies. After clause 12(4), insert: In this clause,— club licence premises means premises in which activities are undertaken under a licence under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 on-licence has the same meaning as in sections 14 to 16 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012. In clause 13(1), delete “small passenger services,”. Replace clause 13(2)﻿(a) and (b) with: ensure that all people who enter the workplace or use its services remain at least 1 metre away from each other and from workers (to the greatest extent practicable), except to the extent that workers are required to have physical contact with, or close proximity to, people in order to carry out the activities of that business or service; and otherwise comply with the requirements in clause 11(2) in relation to the activities to which this clause applies. Revoke clause 13(4). In Part 2, replace the subpart 3 heading with: Replace clause 15 with: In this order, social gathering— means a group of people who are intermingling; but does not include— activities where people remain at least 2 metres away from each other to the greatest extent practicable (for example, activities carried out by people who are at a playground, beach, or park): activities that are undertaken at a business or service in compliance with clauses 10 to 13; but does include a gathering of people if— the gathering is held at the facilities or venue of a business or service that has been hired for the gathering; but the gathering is not held for the purpose of a business or service. Replace clauses 16 and 17 with: A social gathering that exceeds 100 people in a defined space at any 1 time (the number limit) is prohibited. An organiser of a social gathering must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed, and is not likely to exceed, the number limit. A person in control of any premises, or of any defined space in any premises, in which a social gathering is held must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed, and is not likely to exceed, the number limit. Workers who are providing services in relation to a social gathering are not to be counted as part of the number limit. A breach of subclause (2) or (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. A social gathering in which the requirements in subclause (2) are not met is prohibited. The organiser of a social gathering, and the person in control of the defined space or premises in which a social gathering is held, must ensure that at least 1 of the following people keep records to enable contact tracing in relation to the social gathering: the organiser of the social gathering: the person in control of the defined space or premises where the gathering is held: a participant in the social gathering. Subclause (2) does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purposes of contact tracing, every other person who is a participant in the social gathering. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020.  Revoke clauses 18 and 19. Replace clause 21(1)﻿(d) with: to residential centres (including care and protection and youth justice residences), family homes, and group homes (including family group homes and community-based remand centres) that are approved or recognised for the time being by the Chief Executive of Oranga Tamariki as a place of care or treatment for the purposes of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989: In clause 21(1)﻿(e), after “2004”, insert “or any premises managed by or on behalf of the Department of Corrections”.

Revoke clause 23. Dated at Wellington this 27th day of May 2020. This order is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level 2) Amendment Order 2020. It comes into force at 11.59 am on 29 May 2020. This order amends the rules set out in the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level 2) Order 2020 (the principal order). This order amends the rules for certain businesses and services so that they— are allowed to have up to 100 customers and clients in a defined space within a workplace (at any 1 time), rather than being limited to having that number within the entire workplace (see clause 4 for the definition of defined space): can allow customers and clients at a workplace such as a fast food restaurant or cafe to leave their table for the purpose of ordering or collecting food: are no longer required to limit gatherings of friends and whānau, or tables of customers or clients, to a maximum of 10 people. This order amends the rules for social gatherings so that gatherings of up to 100 people in a defined space are allowed, provided that contact tracing requirements are met. This rule applies whether the social gathering occurs at a private venue, public place, or a commercial venue such as a funeral parlour or wedding venue. This rule applies to all kinds of social gatherings, and the previous categories of gathering set out in the principal order (being higher-risk gatherings, gatherings of friends and whānau, lower-risk gatherings, and authorised funeral or tangihanga gatherings) are removed. This order removes the requirement for funeral and tangihanga gatherings to be authorised by the Director-General of Health. Instead, these gatherings will be covered by the ordinary rules for social gatherings. This order also makes technical and minor amendments to the principal order, which include amendments to— introduce a definition of defined space, which may be a space in a venue that is outdoors (for example, a stadium) or a room within premises: clarify that social gathering rules, rather than rules relating to business and services, apply to faith-based gatherings and community club activities (except those that are carried on together with the sale and supply of alcohol under a club licence): amend clauses 9 to 13 of the principal order to clarify that clauses 12 and 13 apply to specific activities, in addition to the general obligations that apply under clause 10 (for retail and other businesses) or clause 11 (for the specific businesses or parts of businesses listed in that clause): clarify and extend certain exclusions relating to Oranga Tamariki and the Department of Corrections.

Premises in the alert level 3 area must be closed unless the business or service that controls those premises complies with the requirements set out in clause 11. However,— this clause does not prevent a person from undertaking any necessary work in any premises for either of the following purposes: minimum basic operations required to maintain the condition or value of, or clean, the premises, plant, equipment, or goods, care for animals, receive stock or freight, and enable and support workers to be able to continue to work remotely from their homes: work required to prepare the premises for opening (and meet public health guidance). this clause does not apply to any premises referred to in section 12(2)﻿(c) or (d) of the Act. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A category A business or service must have systems and processes in place to— ensure that— level 3 physical distancing can be maintained by persons accessing and using the premises, so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the business or service; and the risks that arise to the extent physical distancing is not fully maintained on the premises are mitigated; and in the case of education entities,— keep children, students, and teachers, to the extent reasonably practicable, in groups that are appropriately sized and stable; and for schools, limit students’ physical attendance to years 1 to 10; and ensure that a copy of the QR code for the business or service is displayed in a prominent place at or near the main entrances to the workplace. A category B business or service must have systems and processes in place to— ensure that— level 3 physical distancing can be maintained by persons accessing and using the premises, so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the business or service; and the risks that arise to the extent physical distancing is not fully maintained on the premises are mitigated; and prevent food and drink being served for consumption on the premises (unless the service is an accommodation service); and ensure that a copy of the QR code for the business or service is displayed in a prominent place at or near the main entrances to the workplace. A public transport service must have systems and processes in place to— ensure that— level 3 physical distancing can be maintained by persons accessing and using the premises, so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the business or service; and the risks that arise to the extent physical distancing is not fully maintained on the premises are mitigated; and support contact tracing of persons who access or use the premises. A venue business must have systems and processes in place to— ensure that— level 3 physical distancing can be maintained by persons accessing and using the premises, so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the business or service; and the risks that arise to the extent physical distancing is not fully maintained on the premises are mitigated; and ensure that a copy of the QR code for the business or service is displayed in a prominent place at or near the main entrances to the workplace; and otherwise support contact tracing of persons who access or use the premises; and ensure that the premises are used only for the purpose of a controlled gathering. A category C business or service must have systems and processes in place to— ensure that— level 3 physical distancing can be maintained by persons accessing and using the premises, so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the business or service; and the risks that arise to the extent physical distancing is not fully maintained on the premises are mitigated; and ensure that a copy of the QR code for the business or service is displayed in a prominent place at or near the main entrances to the workplace; and otherwise support contact tracing of persons who access or use the premises; and ensure that— no customers or clients enter the premises (other than only, and then to the minimum extent necessary, to collect goods through a method that minimises physical contact and does not involve entering a building); and there is no close personal contact with customers or clients. A person must not participate in a gathering in any outdoor place in an alert level 3 area. A person must not organise a gathering in any outdoor place in an alert level 3 area. This clause does not apply to an outdoor place that is a venue used for gatherings by a venue business that has the alert level 3 requirements in place. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This Part applies in all areas of New Zealand except to the extent Part 2 applies. A person (person A) who enters a workplace of a business or service, uses its services, or carries out work for the business or service must comply with the requirements described in subclause (2) to the extent that they— apply to the business or service in relation to person A; and are notified to, or brought to the attention of, person A. The requirements are the following (as applied by clause 15): the physical distancing requirements in clauses 16(2)﻿(a) and (b) and 17(2)﻿(a): the requirement in clause 18(2)﻿(b) to ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table except in limited circumstances. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Any reference in clauses 14 or 16 to 19 to a requirement applying to a business or service must be read as a requirement that applies, in accordance with this clause, to the person who is carrying on the business or service. All businesses and services must comply, as far as is reasonably practicable, with— the general requirements in clause 16 or 17 (or both) to the extent applicable; and each of the specific additional requirements in clauses 18 and 19 to the extent that they apply to their activities. More than 1 business or service may operate in the same, or a shared, premises (for example, a shopping mall, a marketplace, or a cafe that operates in an office building) provided that each of those businesses and services is able to comply with all of the requirements in clauses 16 to 19 to the extent that they apply to them or their activities. However,— if there is a gathering of friends and whānau in the workplace at any 1 time,— those people need not comply with the physical distancing requirements in clause 16(2)﻿(b) or 17(2)﻿(a); and a business or service need not ensure that they do so: if the facility or venue of a business or service is hired for a social gathering, the business or service must comply with clauses 21 and 22 in relation to the customers or clients (instead of clauses 16 to 19). In this clause, a gathering of friends and whānau means a group of customers or clients who confirm that they are, or whom it is otherwise reasonable to believe to be, a group of persons who all know each other and can identify each other for the purpose of contact tracing. This clause applies to all businesses and services (except to the extent that clause 17 applies to them). Businesses and services must— ensure that all people who enter the workplace or use its services remain 2 metres away from each other and from the workers (to the greatest extent practicable), except to the extent that paragraph (b) applies; and ensure that all workers who enter the workplace or carry out work for the business or service remain 1 metre away from each other (to the greatest extent practicable); and mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that the physical distancing requirements in paragraphs (a) and (b) (or the specific physical distancing requirements in clauses 17 to 19 that apply instead) are not fully maintained; and display a copy of the QR code for the business or service in a prominent place at or near the main entrances to the workplace; and have other systems and processes in place to support contact tracing of persons who enter the workplace or carry out work for the business or service. A breach of subclause (2) (as applied by clause 15) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause— applies to— businesses and services to the extent that they largely have a consistent group of workers and usually have a fixed workplace, such as office workplaces and factories; and businesses and services to the extent that their customers or clients are members of the business or service, such as gyms; and public facilities that are located within a building or structure, such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums; and event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos; and businesses and services to the extent to which clauses 18 and 19 apply to them (despite paragraph (b)); and courts and tribunals; but does not apply to retail businesses, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway-food stores, and retail stores. The businesses and services and other entities to which this clause applies must— ensure that all people who enter the workplace, use its services, or carry out work for the business or service remain at least 1 metre away from each other (to the greatest extent practicable); and display a copy of the QR code for the business or service in a prominent place at or near the main entrances to the workplace; and have other systems and processes in place to support contact tracing of persons who enter the workplace or carry out work for the business or service; and if they are an event facility of the kind described in subclause (1)﻿(a)﻿(iv), permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time (not including workers); and mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that the physical distancing requirements in paragraph (a) (or the specific physical distancing requirements in clauses 18 and 19 that apply instead) are not fully maintained. A breach of subclause (2) (as applied by clause 15) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause applies to the extent that customers or clients enter the workplace of a business or service and food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) to those customers or clients in that workplace, such as— a restaurant or cafe; or a soup kitchen or other place where food or drink is provided without charge. Businesses and services must— permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time; and ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food and drink except in on-licence premises or club licence premises; and ensure that adjacent tables are arranged so there is at least a 1-metre separation between the seated customers or clients at adjacent tables; and ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that only 1 worker serves at any table; and comply with clause 17(2)﻿(a) in relation to those customers and clients when they are not seated at the table; and otherwise comply with the requirements in clause 17(2) in relation to the activities to which this clause applies. Nothing in this clause applies to— accommodation services selling or providing food or drink for residents (including room service): businesses or services providing food or drink to their workers: vending machines that are located and used within a workplace: cinemas or theatres selling food or drink to customers or clients when they are seated inside the cinema or theatre. A breach of subclause (2) (as applied by clause 15) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause applies to the extent that a business or service cannot operate without physical contact, or close proximity, between people, such as massage and hairdressing services, and professional or semi-professional sports. Businesses and services must— ensure that all people who enter the workplace or use its services remain at least 1 metre away from each other and from workers (to the greatest extent practicable), except to the extent that workers are required to have physical contact with, or close proximity to, people in order to carry out the activities of that business or service; and otherwise comply with the requirements in clause 17(2) in relation to the activities to which this clause applies. A breach of subclause (2) (as applied by clause 15) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person— must not participate in a social gathering that exceeds the number limit in clause 21(1); and must, if participating in a social gathering, comply with the requirements in clause 22 to enable contact tracing records to be kept. However, nothing in this subpart prevents people from residing together in their home or place of residence. A social gathering that exceeds 100 people in a defined space at any 1 time (the number limit) is prohibited. An organiser of a social gathering must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed, and is not likely to exceed, the number limit. A person in control of any premises, or of any defined space in any premises, in which a social gathering is held must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed, and is not likely to exceed, the number limit. Workers who are providing services in relation to a social gathering are not to be counted as part of the number limit. A breach of subclause (2) or (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A social gathering in which the requirements in subclause (2) are not met is prohibited. The organiser of a social gathering, and the person in control of the defined space or premises in which a social gathering is held, must ensure that at least 1 of the following people keep records to enable contact tracing in relation to the social gathering: the organiser of the social gathering: the person in control of the defined space or premises where the gathering is held: a participant in the social gathering. Subclause (2) does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purposes of contact tracing, every other person who is a participant in the social gathering. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. No person may enter an alert level 3 area unless— they are returning to their principal home or place of residence in the alert level 3 area; or it is necessary for the purpose of providing a business or service listed in Schedule 3; or they are entering on an aircraft for the purpose of directly transiting on another aircraft to another place in New Zealand or outside New Zealand. In this clause, a person directly transits if the person— does not leave the airport except to board their departing flight; and their departing flight is scheduled to depart within 12 hours of the person entering the airport. Nothing in this Part applies— to people using public transport services: people who are at an education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services, provided that the education entity has systems and processes in place to— enable suitable contact tracing of people who enter the relevant workplaces, or deliver or use the relevant services; and mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that the physical distancing requirements in this order that would otherwise apply to the workplace or service are not fully maintained. Subclause (1)﻿(b) does not apply to— inter-school activities; or activities at (or connected with) an education entity that are attended by people who are otherwise not ordinarily at that education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services. Nothing in this order prevents any person from assisting in, or responding to, an emergency. Nothing in this order applies— to the provision of health services: to people using a service for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward that is contracted or funded by the Ministry of Education, local authorities, or Auckland Transport for the sole or primary purpose of transporting school children to and from school: to residential centres (including care and protection and youth justice residences), family homes, and group homes (including family group homes and community-based remand centres) that are approved or recognised for the time being by the Chief Executive of Oranga Tamariki as a place of care or treatment for the purposes of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989: within a corrections prison as defined in section 3(1) of the Corrections Act 2004 or any premises managed by or on behalf of the Department of Corrections: to custodial or detention services managed by the New Zealand Police, the Department of Corrections, or the Ministry of Justice, or within a courthouse: to the administration of sentences and orders by the Department of Corrections, or on its behalf, in accordance with the Corrections Act 2004: to people being transported for the purposes of the Department of Corrections and New Zealand Police fulfilling their purposes and performing their functions and duties: to the New Zealand Defence Force: to the New Zealand Police: to Fire and Emergency New Zealand. The Director-General may exempt any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods (or person, business, or service) from the application of any provision of this order or from the requirement to comply with any provision of this order if the Director-General is satisfied that— the exemption is necessary or desirable in order to promote the purposes of the Act or the purposes of this order; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemption. The Director-General may impose conditions on the exemption as the Director-General considers necessary. The exemption must— be published on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government; and be notified in the Gazette. A person is permitted do any of the following as essential personal movement (in addition to the permissions in clause 9) if they leave the alert level 3 area before 11:59pm on 14 August 2020: leave by aircraft if— they are returning to their principal home or place of residence in another place in New Zealand; and they wear a face covering while on the aircraft (except if the requirement does not apply under subclause (3)); and leave by any other means if they are returning to their principal home or place of residence in another place in New Zealand. In this clause, a face covering includes a face mask or face shield designed, or made to be worn, over the nose and mouth to provide the wearer protection against infection. The requirement in clause 1(a)﻿(ii) does not apply if any of the following applies: the person is under the age of 12 years: the person has a physical or mental health illness or condition or disability that makes wearing a face covering unsuitable: the person is communicating with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing and visibility of the mouth is essential for communication: the person is asked to remove the face covering to ascertain identity: there is an emergency: doing so is not safe in all the circumstances: removal or not wearing the face covering is otherwise required or authorised by law. A person may enter an alert level 3 area, despite clause 23, for the purpose of enabling them to travel through the alert level 3 area to return to their principal home or place of residence if they leave the alert level 3 area before 11:59 pm on 14 August 2020. Dated at Wellington this 12th day of August 2020. This order is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level 3 and 2) Order 2020. It comes into force at 11.59 am on 12 August 2020 (except for the requirements relating to displaying QR codes, which are deferred 11:59 am on 19 August 2020) as the Minister of Health is satisfied that it needs to come into force urgently to prevent or contain the outbreak or spread of COVID-19. The Minister of Health proposes to further review the application of the order no later than midnight on 14 August 2020. This order applies in addition to the public health guidance and other requirements that can be applied under the Health Act 1956 (for example, the ability for a medical officer of health to require a person to be tested under Part 3 of that Act). Part 1 of this order sets out the purpose of this order (see clause 3) and definitions used in the order (see clause 4). The purpose of this order is to prevent, and limit the risk of, the outbreak or spread of COVID-19. Clause 5 refers to the transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1. Clause 6 provides that this order applies in New Zealand. Part 2 of this order applies in the alert level 3 area, to any property if a part of it is in the alert level 3 area, and to any other place if necessary for the purposes of enforcing the measures in those 2 places (for example, to enable road blocks). The alert level 3 area means the boundaries of Auckland as determined by the Local Government (Auckland Boundaries) Determination 2010. Clauses 8 and 9 set out the stay-at-home and physical distancing requirements in the alert level 3 area. All people within that area must— remain at their current home or place of residence, except for essential personal movement; and maintain physical distancing to the greatest extent practicable. For the alert level 3 area, this means staying 2 metres away from other people, other than in certain businesses where people must stay 1 metre away from other people (see the definition of level 3 physical distancing); and if their home is mobile, keep that home in the same general location, except for essential personal movement. A breach of these requirements is an infringement offence. These requirements do not apply to a person while the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020 or the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order 2020 applies to that person. Clause 9 sets out movements that are permitted as essential personal movement. These are the reasons for which a person is permitted to leave their current home or place of residence and include, in specified circumstances and subject to specified conditions,— accessing businesses and services: attending education entities: working: limited recreation purposes: limited customary purposes: controlled gatherings: extended bubble arrangements and shared caregiving arrangements: relocating premises: accessing medical services, visiting hospitals, accessing courts, emergencies, and court orders: travel home by managed arrivals or travel by visitors to leave New Zealand. Clauses 10 and 11 set out the requirements for businesses and services. Premises in the alert level 3 area must be closed unless the business or service that controls those premises complies with specified requirements. Those requirements are set out in clause 11 and differ, depending on whether the business or service is a Category A business or service, a Category B business or service, a public transport service, a venue business, or a Category C business or service. Clause 12 prohibits outdoor gatherings in an alert level 3 area, other than an outdoor place that is a venue used for gatherings that has the relevant alert level 3 requirements in place. Part 3 of this order applies in all areas of New Zealand to which Part 2 does not apply. Clauses 14 to 19 set out the requirements for workplaces. Clause 14 requires a person to comply with measures that are put in place by a business or service to meet the physical distancing and related requirements of this order and that have been notified to, or brought to the attention of, the person. Failure to comply with those measures is an infringement offence. Clause 15 sets out which of clauses 16 to 19 businesses and services must comply with. Clause 16 sets out a list of general requirements that apply to all businesses or services (except to the extent that clause 17 applies to them). This includes requirements that businesses and services must— ensure that all people who enter the workplace or use its services must remain 2 metres away from each other and from the workers: ensure that all workers must remain 1 metre away from each other: mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained: display a copy of the QR code (as defined in clause 4) for the business or service: have systems and processes in place to otherwise support contact tracing. A breach of clause 16 is an infringement offence. The following businesses, services, and entities must comply with the specific controlled access requirements in clause 17: businesses or services that have a largely consistent group of workers and that usually have a fixed workplace (such as office workplaces and factories): businesses or services with customers or clients that are members of the business or service (such as gyms): public facilities located within a building or structure (such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums): event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos: certain other businesses: courts and tribunals. Businesses or services with workplaces that customers may enter and where food or drink is sold or provided to be consumed there (such as restaurants, cafes, and soup kitchens) must comply with the specific food and drink requirements in clause 18.  Businesses or services that cannot operate without physical contact or close proximity between people (such as massage and hairdressing services, small passenger services, and professional sports) must comply with the specific proximity requirements in clause 19. Clauses 20 to 22 set out the requirements for social gatherings. (Social gathering is defined in clause 4.) Clause 20 provides that people must not participate in a social gathering that exceeds 100 people in a defined space at any 1 time (not including workers who are providing services in relation to the gathering). It is an infringement offence if an organiser of a social gathering, or a person in control of premises in which a social gathering is held, fails to ensure that the social gathering does not, and is not likely to, exceed 100 people. Clause 22 requires the organiser of a social gathering, and the person in control of the premises in which a social gathering is held, to ensure that a specified person keeps records to enable contact tracing in relation to the social gathering. This does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purpose of contact tracing, every other person at the social gathering. It is an infringement offence if people fail to ensure that a specified person keeps records to enable contact tracing in relation to the social gathering. Clause 23 prohibits persons from entering the alert level 3 area unless they are returning to their principal home or place of residence in that area, it is necessary to do so for the purpose of providing a business or service listed in Schedule 3, or they are only directly transiting through the airport on a connecting flight out of the alert level 3 area. Under clause 23, for the alert level 2 requirements in Part 2,— there is an exemption for people using public transport services; and people who attend an education entity are excluded as long as appropriate systems and processes are put in place to enable contact tracing of people and to mitigate the risks that arise where physical distancing is not maintained. There is an exclusion from the application of this order for assisting in or responding to an emergency in clause 24.  Other exclusions from the application of this order apply to specified activities and services set out in clause 25. A power to grant exemptions from any provision of this order is conferred on the Director-General of Health by clause 26, subject to the Director-General being satisfied that certain criteria are met. Schedule 1 is for transitional, savings, and related provisions. These include time-limited exclusions enabling people to return to their principal home or place of residence outside the alert level 3 area. Schedule 2 sets out a list of category A businesses and services and category B businesses. Schedule 3 sets out a list of businesses and services for which interregional travel is permitted for work purposes.

For the purpose of the definition of defined space in subclause (1),—  an indoor space or outdoor space is a single space if there are walls (whether permanent or temporary) that substantially divide that space from other spaces: an outdoor space is also a single space if there is at least 2 metres away between all people in that space and any other people (outside that space). A reference in this order to a requirement applying to a business or service applies that requirement to the person who carries on that business or service. A requirement for a particular activity applies to a business or service to the extent that the activity is carried out. If more than 1 business or service operates in the same, or a shared, premises (for example, a shopping mall, a marketplace, or a cafe that operates in an office building), each of those businesses and services must comply with all of the requirements in this order to the extent that they apply to that business or service or its activities. The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. This Part applies to the whole of New Zealand. In this order, the 1-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 1 metre away from any other person; but applies only in a workplace; and applies only if the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) applies to each person referred to in paragraph (a) (for example, both persons are workers); and does not apply to a person in relation to their fellow residents (in any alert level area) or to a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace (in an area that is not an alert level 3 area). In this order, the 2-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain 2 metres away from any other person; but does not apply to a person in relation to their fellow residents (in any alert level area) or to a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace (in an area that is not an alert level 3 area). A business or service must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (to the greatest extent practicable) for all workers in a workplace of, or while working for, the business or service; and maintain compliance with the 2-metre physical distancing rule (to the greatest extent practicable) for any other persons entering a workplace, or using the services, of the business or service; and mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained. Subclause (1)﻿(a) and (b) applies except as adjusted under any of clauses 18 and 23 to 28. See also the general physical distancing requirements in clause 16 that apply to people in the alert level 3 area if they are not in a workplace. A breach of subclause (1)﻿(a), (b), or (c) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person in control of a workplace must— ensure that a copy of a QR code for the workplace is displayed in a prominent place at or near the main entrance (if any) of the workplace; and have other record-keeping systems and processes in place to enable the contact tracing of all persons entering the workplace. However, there are additional requirements for contact tracing within the alert level 3 area for businesses and services (other than category A businesses and services, category B businesses, education entities, or public transport services) under clause 18. In this clause, workplace does not include any vehicle, vessel, train, tram, ship, or aircraft. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person may go into the alert level 3 area from another area, or go out of the alert level 3 area into another area, only if— that travel is for 1 or more of the purposes permitted under clause 12; and the person, to the greatest extent practicable, travels directly without stopping (except for a permitted airport transfer) while in the alert level 3 area. For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(b), a permitted airport transfer is a stop by a person at an airport for the purpose of transferring to an aircraft to go to another place in New Zealand or outside New Zealand if— the person does not leave the airport except to board a departing flight or to stay in temporary accommodation; and the person’s departing flight is scheduled to depart within 24 hours after the person enters the airport. For the purposes of clause 11, a person is permitted to go into, or out of, the alert level 3 area (but not into, through, and out of the alert level 3 area in 1 trip) for 1 or more of the following purposes: to go to the person’s principal home or place of residence: to go to, return from, or carry out work for a business or service listed in Schedule 3 (and, if necessary, stay in no more than 1 place as temporary accommodation): to carry out any activity associated with the person’s role as an electoral candidate: if the person is a child, to go to, or return from, the home or place of residence of a shared caregiver (and then visit or stay), whether or not it is the child’s principal home or place of residence: if the person is a shared caregiver or fellow resident, to accompany a child going to, or returning from, the home or place of residence of a shared caregiver or to collect a child for that purpose: to provide urgent care for a child or for the purpose of providing care or support to a person in a critical or terminal condition if no other appropriate person is able to provide that care or support in the area in which it is needed: to go to, and return from, an appointment with a health service: to attend a court, tribunal, New Zealand Parole Board hearing, or other judicial institution that they are required or permitted to attend by that institution: to relocate their home or place of residence or business premises: to leave or change the person’s home or place of residence as required by a court order or any other power under any enactment to order a person to be detained, to change their place of detention, or otherwise determine their place of residence (for example, a direction of the New Zealand Parole Board or a probation officer), or to go to a home or place of residence after that detention or determination ceases: in the case of a person who has arrived in New Zealand (and to whom the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020 or the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order 2020 does not apply or no longer applies), to go to the person’s intended home or place of residence in New Zealand: to collect a person referred to in paragraph (k) for the purpose of accompanying them to their intended home or place of residence in New Zealand: if leaving New Zealand for another jurisdiction, to go to— an airport or port from which the person will leave New Zealand; or any managed isolation or quarantine facility immediately before leaving New Zealand: if it is necessary to preserve their own or any other person’s life or safety: to accompany any person referred to in paragraphs (a) to (n). For the purposes of clause 11, a person may go into, through, and out of the alert level 3 area (in 1 trip) for the purpose of going to, or returning from, work or going to the person’s principal home or place of residence if— neither the place of departure nor the destination is in the alert level 3 area; and it is necessary to travel through the alert level 3 area for that purpose; and the person carries evidence of the purpose of their travel and the location of the place of departure and destination. The permissions in this clause do not apply to travel that takes place only within the alert level 3 area (to which clause 15 applies). This Part applies— to the alert level 3 area; and to any property if a part of it is in the alert level 3 area; and to any other place if necessary for the purpose of enforcing the requirements in a place referred to in paragraph (a) or (b). All persons within the alert level 3 area must— remain at their current home or place of residence, except for essential personal movement; and if their home or place of residence is mobile, keep that home or place of residence in the same general location, except to the extent that they would be permitted (if it were not mobile) to leave the home or place of residence as essential personal movement. A breach of subclause (1)﻿(a) or (b) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person is permitted to do any of the following as essential personal movement within the alert level 3 area: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of accessing any business or service operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements if doing so for their own needs or on behalf of a fellow resident, a vulnerable person, or a high-risk person: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of attending any education entity if permitted to do so by the entity in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of providing a business or service operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements (or to do necessary work at any premises under clause 17(2)): leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of working at an education entity operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements: leave their home or place of residence to carry out any activity associated with the person’s role as an electoral candidate: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of exercise or other recreation if— it is done in an outdoor place appropriate for that kind of exercise or recreation that is readily accessible (including by using their vehicle) from their home or place of residence; and it is done in compliance with the requirements that relate to physical distancing (see clause 16) and the prohibition against gathering in outdoor spaces (see clause 19); and it does not involve flying manned aircraft, scuba-diving, hunting in motorised vehicles, or water-based activities involving sailing boats, motorised craft, or motorised equipment; and it does not involve any other activities that expose the participant to danger (taking account of their experience and abilities): leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of exercising Māori customary rights to fishing and food gathering if— it is done in an outdoor place appropriate for that kind of exercise or recreation that is readily accessible (including by using their vehicle) from their home or place of residence; and it is done in compliance with the requirements that relate to physical distancing (see clause 16) and the prohibition against gathering in outdoor spaces (see clause 19); and it does not involve flying manned aircraft, scuba-diving, hunting in motorised vehicles, or water-based activities involving sailing boats, motorised craft, or motorised equipment; and it does not involve any other activities that expose the participant to danger (taking account of their experience and abilities): leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of attending a controlled gathering: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of visiting or staying at another home or place of residence (and then visit or stay) if those homes or places of residence have an extended bubble arrangement: if the person is a child, leave the extended bubble arrangement of one shared caregiver for the purpose of visiting or staying at the extended bubble arrangement of another shared caregiver: relocate their home or place of residence or business premises, or leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of arranging or carrying out the relocation (including for inspection of the property or a potential property): leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of accessing health services: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of providing urgent care for a child or for the purpose of providing care or support to a person in a critical or terminal condition if no other appropriate person is able to provide that care or support in the area in which it is needed: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of visiting people in residential disability care (as defined in the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001) if permitted to do so by the care provider: leave their home or place of residence to care for their pets or other animals: leave their home or place of residence to attend a court, tribunal, New Zealand Parole Board hearing, or other judicial institution: leave their home or place of residence if it is necessary to preserve their own or any other person’s life or safety: change their home or place of residence if necessary to use another temporary or emergency home or place of residence (for example, for care while sick or to seek refuge in women’s refuge accommodation): leave or change the person’s home or place of residence as required by a court order or any other power under any enactment to order a person to be detained, to change their place of detention, or otherwise determine their place of residence (for example, a direction of the New Zealand Parole Board or a probation officer), or go to a home or place of residence after that detention or determination ceases: in the case of a person who has arrived in New Zealand (and to whom the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020 or the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order 2020 does not apply or no longer applies), go to the person’s intended home or place of residence in the alert level 3 area: leave their home or place of residence to collect a person referred to in paragraph (t) for the purpose of accompanying them to their intended home or place of residence in the alert level 3 area: if leaving New Zealand for another jurisdiction, leave their home or place of residence to go to— an airport or port from which the person will leave New Zealand; or any managed isolation and quarantine facility immediately before leaving New Zealand: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of going into, or out of, the alert level 3 area for a purpose permitted by clause 11: leave their home or place of residence to assist a fellow resident to carry out essential personal movement or to accompany a fellow resident carrying out essential personal movement, but only to the extent permitted for that fellow resident under this clause. All persons within the alert level 3 area must comply with the 2-metre physical distancing rule (to the greatest extent practicable). However, if the 1-metre physical distancing rule applies to the person in a workplace under Part 2 or clause 18, the person must instead comply with that rule as so applied. A breach of subclause (1) or (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person in control of premises in the alert level 3 area must close those premises unless the person is carrying on a business or service that is operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements. However,— this clause does not prevent a person from undertaking any necessary work in any premises for either of the following purposes: minimum basic operations required to— maintain the condition or value of, or clean, the premises, or any plant, equipment, or goods in the premises: care for animals: receive stock or freight: enable workers to work, or to continue to work, remotely from their homes or places of residence: to prepare the premises for opening (and to meet public health guidance); and this clause does not apply to any premises referred to in section 12(2)﻿(c) or (d) of the Act. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A business or service must operate in compliance with the following alert level 3 requirements, in addition to those set out in Part 2 (or, in the case of physical distancing rules, as adjusted from those set out in that Part): a category A business or service must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the business or service: a category B business must have systems and processes in place to prevent food and drink from being served for consumption on the premises (unless the service is an accommodation service): an education entity must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the education entity; and keep children, students, and teachers, to the extent reasonably practicable, in groups that are appropriately sized and stable; and for schools, limit students’ physical attendance to students in years 1 to 10 and, for other students, as otherwise permitted by any direction given by the chief executive of the Ministry of Education under Schedule 25 of the Education and Training Act 2020: a public transport service must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the service: a venue business must have systems and processes in place to ensure that— the venue workplace is used only for the purpose of a controlled gathering; and to the greatest extent practicable, each person who enters the workplace— scans the QR code for the workplace; or provides details in a contact tracing record that the person in control of the workplace collects:  all businesses and services other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) to (e) must have systems and processes in place to ensure that— no customers or clients enter the workplace (other than only, and then to the minimum extent necessary, to collect goods through a method that minimises physical contact and does not involve entering a building); and there is no close personal contact with or between customers or clients; and to the greatest extent practicable, each person who enters the workplace— scans the QR code for the workplace; or provides details in a contact tracing record that the person in control of the workplace collects.  If subclause (1)﻿(e)﻿(ii) or (f)﻿(iii) applies,— the person in control of the workplace must keep the record collected under that subclause for a period of 30 days; and workplace, for that purpose and for that subclause, does not include any vehicle, vessel, train, tram, ship, or aircraft. A breach of subclause (1) or (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person must not participate in a gathering in any outdoor place in an alert level 3 area. A person must not organise a gathering in any outdoor place in an alert level 3 area. This clause does not apply to— a gathering of fellow residents; or a gathering organised by a venue business operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This Part applies to all areas of New Zealand except to the extent that Part 3 applies. The alert level 2 requirements in clauses 22 to 28 do not apply to the following activities (but see the requirements for social gatherings in clauses 29 to 31): voluntary or not-for-profit sporting, recreational, social, or cultural activities; or households carrying out family activities in their household unit; or faith-based gatherings; or community club activities (except activities that occur at the same time and place as services provided under a club licence under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012). In addition, if a facility or venue of a business or service is hired for a social gathering, the business or service must comply with the requirements for social gatherings in clauses 30 and 31 (instead of the alert level 2 requirements in clauses 22 to 28). A person (person A) who enters a workplace of, uses the services of, or works for a business or service must comply with— either— the 2-metre physical distancing rule (to the greatest extent practicable); or the 1-metre physical distancing rule to the extent that that rule applies to the person (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) under clause 9 and clauses 26 to 28; and the requirement in clause 27(2)﻿(b) to ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table when that rule applies under clause 27. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for category A businesses and services. The businesses and services must maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the business or service. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for education entities. Education entities— need not maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for people who are at the education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services; but must have systems and processes in place to mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that compliance with the physical distancing requirements in this order that would otherwise apply to the workplace or service is not fully maintained. The exclusion in subclause (2) does not apply to— inter-school activities; or activities at (or connected with) an education entity that are attended by people who are otherwise not ordinarily at that education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for public transport services. Public transport services need not maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for people using those services. This clause adjusts and adds to the alert level 2 requirements for controlled-access businesses and services. In this clause, controlled-access businesses and services— means the following businesses and services: businesses and services to the extent that they largely have a consistent group of workers and usually have a fixed workplace, such as office workplaces and factories; and businesses and services to the extent that their customers or clients are members of the business or service, such as gyms; and public facilities that are located within a building or structure, such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums; and event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos; and businesses and services to the extent to which clauses 27 and 28 apply to them (despite paragraph (b)); but excludes retail businesses, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway-food stores, and retail stores. The controlled-access businesses and services must— maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) to the greatest extent practicable; and if they are an event facility of the kind described in subclause (2)﻿(a)﻿(iv), permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the facility at any 1 time (not including workers). A breach of subclause (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adds to and adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for a business or service to the extent that customers or clients enter its workplace and food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) to those customers or clients in that workplace, such as— a restaurant or cafe; or a soup kitchen or other place where food or drink is provided without charge. Businesses and services must, in relation to that activity,— permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time; and ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food and drink, except in on-licence premises or club licence premises; and ensure that there is at least a 1-metre separation between adjacent tables where customers or clients are seated; and ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that only 1 worker serves at any table; and maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule for all customers and clients when they are not seated at a table (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) to the greatest extent practicable. Nothing in this clause applies to— accommodation services selling or providing food or drink for residents (including room service): businesses or services providing food or drink to their workers: vending machines that are located and used within a workplace: cinemas or theatres selling food or drink to customers or clients when they are seated inside the cinema or theatre. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for a business or service to the extent that it cannot operate without physical contact, or close proximity, between people (for example, massage and hairdressing services or professional or semi-professional sports). Businesses and services must, in relation to that activity, maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) to the greatest extent practicable. However, subclause (2) does not apply to the extent that workers are required to have physical contact with, or close proximity to, people in order to carry out the activities of that business or service. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person— must not participate in a social gathering that exceeds the number limit in clause 30(1); and must, if participating in a social gathering, comply with the requirements in clause 31 to enable contact tracing records to be kept. However, nothing in this Part prevents people from residing together in their home or place of residence. A social gathering that exceeds 100 people in a defined space at any one time (the number limit) is prohibited. An organiser of a social gathering must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed, and is not likely to exceed, the number limit. A person in control of any premises, or of any defined space in any premises, in which a social gathering is held must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed, and is not likely to exceed, the number limit. Workers who are providing services in relation to a social gathering are not to be counted as part of the number limit. A breach of subclause (2) or (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A social gathering in which the requirements in subclause (2) are not met is prohibited. The organiser of a social gathering, and the person in control of the defined space or premises in which a social gathering is held, must ensure that at least one of the following people keeps contact tracing records to enable contact tracing in relation to the social gathering: the organiser of the social gathering: the person in control of the defined space or premises where the gathering is held: a participant in the social gathering. Subclause (2) does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purposes of contact tracing, every other person who is a participant in the social gathering. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Nothing in this order prevents any person from assisting in, or responding to, an emergency. Nothing in this order applies— to border services provided by Immigration New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, Maritime New Zealand, or the Ministry for Primary Industries: to the provision of health services: to people using a service for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward that is contracted or funded by the Ministry of Education, local authorities, or Auckland Transport for the sole or primary purpose of transporting children to and from school: to residential centres (including care and protection and youth justice residences), family homes, and group homes (including family group homes and community-based remand centres) that are approved or recognised for the time being by the chief executive of Oranga Tamariki as a place of care or treatment for the purposes of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989: within a corrections prison as defined in section 3(1) of the Corrections Act 2004 or any premises managed by or on behalf of the Department of Corrections: to custodial or detention services managed by the New Zealand Police, the Department of Corrections, or the Ministry of Justice, or within a courthouse: to the administration of sentences and orders by the Department of Corrections or on its behalf: to people being transported for the purposes of the Department of Corrections and New Zealand Police fulfilling their purposes and performing their functions and duties: to the New Zealand Parole Board: to the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service: to the Government Communications Security Bureau: to the New Zealand Defence Force: to the New Zealand Police: to Fire and Emergency New Zealand: to civil defence emergency management services provided by the National Emergency Management Agency and Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups: to workers of any business or service referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (o): to people in respect of whom either of the following applies: the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020: the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order 2020: to people who are enforcement officers carrying out their functions and powers under the Act. The Director-General may exempt any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods (or person, business, or service) from the application of any provision of this order or from the requirement to comply with any provision of this order if the Director-General is satisfied that— the exemption is necessary or desirable in order to promote the purposes of the Act or the purposes of this order; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemption. The Director-General may impose conditions on the exemption as the Director-General considers necessary.

In addition, the principal order is adjusted so that if a vehicle operating as part of a public transport service travels to, from, or through the Auckland area, people will be required to wear face coverings for the duration of the journey. This will be the case even though part of the journey may be through an area of New Zealand that is at alert level 1. Face coverings will not be required on public transport services where the entire journey takes place in an area that is at alert level 1. This order must be approved by a resolution of the House of Representatives before the expiry of the period described in section 16(2) of the Act. If this does not happen, the order is revoked on the expiry of that period.

This order is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Amendment Order (No 2) 2020. This order comes into force at 11.59 pm on 23 September 2020. This order amends the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order 2020 (the principal order). Replace clause 10(1)﻿(a) with: in the case of a specified workplace, all workers of that workplace entering the workplace: After clause 10(2), insert: For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(a), specified workplace means— a transport station; or a supermarket; or a petrol station, including any business operating out of the petrol station.

Supermarkets and petrol stations will now only be required to have these systems in place to enable records to be kept of workers entering those workplaces, rather than everyone who enters those workplaces. This is the same as the current requirement for transport stations. When this order comes into effect, the Auckland area will be the only part of New Zealand where the alert level 2 requirements apply. Accordingly, the amendments made by this order affect only the Auckland area. This order must be approved by a resolution of the House of Representatives before the expiry of the period described in section 16(2) of the Act.

However, subclause (1)— does not apply if the workplace is a vehicle; and applies to the workplace of a business or service that is in a dwelling house only if— customers or clients of the business or service customarily enter the dwelling house; or workers of the business or service customarily enter the dwelling house (and those workers are not residents of the dwelling house or providing a category A social service). A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person in control of a public transport service must ensure that a copy of a QR code is displayed in a prominent place on or inside any vehicle that is in use as part of that service.

For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(a), specified workplace means— a transport station; or a supermarket; or a petrol station, including any business operating out of the petrol station. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act.

See also additional requirements for contact tracing in clause 24(1)﻿(f) and (g). Every person must wear a face covering while on board a vehicle that is in use as part of a public transport service. However, subclause (1) does not apply— to a person who is a passenger on a small passenger service vehicle; or to a ferry service carrying passengers between the North Island and the South Island; or to air transport; or to a school transport service; or in the circumstances set out in clause 14. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Every person must wear a face covering while on board a vehicle that is in use as part of a domestic air transport service. However, subclause (1) does not apply in the circumstances set out in clause 14. In this clause, domestic air transport service means a public transport service that is transporting persons by air transport between places that are both in New Zealand. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Clauses 12(1) and 13(1) do not apply if— there is an emergency; or wearing a face covering is not safe in all of the circumstances; or the person is in a defined space or an enclosed space that is separate from the passenger area; or the person is communicating with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing and visibility of the mouth is essential for communication; or the person is asked to remove the face covering to ascertain identity; or removal of, or not wearing, the face covering is otherwise required or authorised by law; or the person is under the age of 12 years; or the person has a physical or mental illness or condition or disability that makes wearing a face covering unsuitable; or the person needs to remove the face covering to take medicine; or the person needs to remove the face covering to eat or drink (if eating or drinking is permitted by the conditions of carriage on the relevant service). In this order, the 1-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 1 metre away from any other person; but applies only if the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) applies to each person referred to in paragraph (a) (for example, if both persons are workers); and does not apply to— a person in relation to their fellow residents (in any alert level area); or a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace (in an alert level area that is not an alert level 3 area). In this order, the 2-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 2 metres away from any other person; but does not apply to— a person in relation to their fellow residents (in any alert level area); or a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace (in an alert level area that is not an alert level 3 area). If a vehicle that is in use as part of a public transport service travels on a specified route, clause 24(1)﻿(d) or (e) applies in respect of the entire specified route taken by that vehicle. In this clause, specified route means a route that involves a vehicle travelling— from the alert level 3 area to the alert level 2 area; or to and from the alert level 2 area, if the vehicle passes through the alert level 3 area; or from the alert level 2 area to the alert level 3 area. This clause does not apply to— a school transport service; or travel that takes place only within the alert level 2 area (see clause 33). A person may go into an alert level 3 area from another alert level area, or go out of an alert level 3 area into another alert level area, only if— that travel is for 1 or more of the purposes permitted under clause 18; and the person, so far as is reasonably practicable, travels directly without stopping (except for a permitted airport transfer) while in the alert level 3 area. For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(b), a permitted airport transfer is a stop by a person at an airport for the purpose of transferring to an aircraft to go to another place in New Zealand or outside New Zealand if— the person does not leave the airport except to board a departing flight or to stay in temporary accommodation; and the person’s departing flight is scheduled to depart within 24 hours after the person enters the airport.

All persons in the alert level 3 area must comply with the 2-metre physical distancing rule so far as is reasonably practicable. Subclause (1) is subject to subclauses (3), (4), (5), and (6). All workers of a business or service in the workplace of, or while working for, the business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable.

A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A business or service must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all workers in a workplace of, or while working for, the business or service; and maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 2-metre physical distancing rule for any other persons entering a workplace, or using the services, of the business or service; and mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained (for example, through regular cleaning of surfaces or the installation of plastic barriers). Subclause (1)﻿(a) and (b) applies except to the extent adjusted by clause 24. A business or service must operate in compliance with the following alert level 3 requirements: a category A business or service must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service: a category B business or service must have systems and processes in place to prevent food and drink from being served for consumption on the premises: an education entity must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service; and keep children, students, and teachers, so far as is reasonably practicable, in groups that are appropriately sized and stable; and for schools, limit students’ physical attendance to students in years 1 to 10 and, for other students, as otherwise permitted by any direction given by the chief executive of the Ministry of Education under Schedule 25 of the Education and Training Act 2020: a transport station and a public transport service (other than one provided by means of air transport or a small passenger service vehicle) must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service: a public transport service provided by means of air transport or a small passenger service vehicle must have systems and processes in place to maintain physical distancing so far as is reasonably practicable for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service: a venue business must have systems and processes in place to ensure that— the venue workplace is used only for the purpose of a controlled gathering; and so far as is reasonably practicable, each person who enters the venue workplace— scans the QR code for the workplace; or provides details in a contact tracing record that the person in control of the venue workplace collects:  all businesses and services other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) to (f) must have systems and processes in place to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable that— no customers or clients enter the workplace (other than only, and then to the minimum extent necessary, to collect goods through a method that minimises physical contact and does not involve— entering a building; or in the case of a shopping mall, entering an individual store); and there is no close personal contact with or between customers or clients; and each person who enters the workplace— scans the QR code for the workplace; or provides details in a contact tracing record that the person in control of the workplace collects.  If subclause (1)﻿(f)﻿(ii) or (g)﻿(iii) applies, the person in control of the workplace must keep the contact tracing record for a period of 30 days. Subclause (1)﻿(f)﻿(ii) and (g)﻿(iii) does not apply to a workplace that is excluded from the application of clause 9(1). A person must not attend a gathering in any outdoor place in an alert level 3 area. A person must not organise a gathering in any outdoor place in an alert level 3 area. This clause does not apply to— a gathering of fellow residents; or a gathering organised by a venue business operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements; or a controlled gathering (see clause 26); or any premises referred to in section 12(2)﻿(d) of the Act. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A controlled gathering is permitted in an alert level 3 area, but only if the requirements in subclause (2) are met. The people responsible for a controlled gathering in an alert level 3 area must ensure that there are systems and processes in place to ensure that, so far as is reasonably practicable, each person who attends the controlled gathering— scans the QR code for the controlled gathering; or provides details in a contact tracing record that is kept by one of the people responsible for or attending the controlled gathering. Subclause (2) does not apply if every person at the controlled gathering knows, and can identify for the purposes of contact tracing, every other person who is attending the controlled gathering. Subclauses (1) and (2) do not apply to a gathering organised by a venue business operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In relation to how the contact tracing record under subclause (2) is collected, kept, and used, see the requirements in the Privacy Act 2020 that apply to persons collecting personal information. In this clause, controlled gathering means a gathering that meets all of the following requirements: there are no more than 10 people at any one time at the gathering (including any celebrant, organiser, or other assistant); and the gathering is for one of the following purposes: a funeral service: a tangihanga: a wedding or civil union service; and the gathering is one at which no food or drink is served. If clause 26(2) applies to a controlled gathering, a person who attends the controlled gathering must— scan the QR code for the controlled gathering; or provide details in the contact tracing record referred to in that clause. Clauses 29 to 37 apply to workplaces of businesses and services, but do not apply to— voluntary or not-for-profit sporting, recreational, social, or cultural activities; or community club activities (except activities that occur at the same time and place as services provided under a club licence under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012); or faith-based gatherings; or households carrying out family activities involving only fellow residents; or a gathering held at a facility or venue of a business or service that has been hired for the gathering if the gathering is not for the purpose of the business or service. See clauses 39 to 43, which contain requirements relating to social gatherings (including those described in subclause (1)﻿(a) to (e)). However, nothing in this Part applies to a school transport service. A business or service must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all workers in a workplace of, or while working for, the business or service; and maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 2-metre physical distancing rule for any other persons entering a workplace, or using the services, of the business or service; and mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained (for example, through regular cleaning of surfaces or the installation of plastic barriers). Subclause (1)﻿(a) and (b) applies except to the extent adjusted by clauses 31 to 37. All workers of a business or service in the workplace of, or while working for, the business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. All other persons who enter a workplace of, or use the services of, a business or service must comply with the 2-metre physical distancing rule so far as is reasonably practicable. Subclauses (1) and (2) apply except to the extent adjusted by clauses 31 to 37. A breach of subclause (1) or (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for category A businesses and services. Category A businesses and services must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a category A business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for education entities. Education entities— need not have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for people who are ordinarily at the education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services; but must have systems and processes in place to mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that compliance with the physical distancing requirements that would otherwise apply under this Part to the workplace or service is not fully maintained (for example, regular cleaning of surfaces). People who are ordinarily at an education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services are not required to comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule. The adjustment in subclause (2) and the exemption from physical distancing in subclause (3) do not apply to— inter-school activities; or activities at (or connected with) an education entity that are attended by people who are otherwise not ordinarily at that education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for public transport services. Public transport services need not have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a public transport service are not required to comply with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule. See, however, clause 16 if the vehicle travels on a specified route described in that clause. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for transport stations. Transport stations must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a transport station must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for controlled-access businesses and services. In this clause, controlled-access businesses and services— means the following businesses and services: businesses and services to the extent that they largely have a consistent group of workers and usually have a fixed workplace, such as office workplaces and factories; and businesses and services to the extent that their customers or clients are members of the business or service, such as gyms; and public facilities that are located within a building or structure, such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums; and event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos; but excludes retail businesses, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway-food stores, and retail stores. Controlled-access businesses and services must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service; and if they are an event facility, permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the facility at any 1 time (not including workers). All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a controlled-access business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (4) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for businesses or services to the extent that customers or clients enter their workplaces and food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) to those customers or clients in the workplace, such as— a restaurant or cafe; or a soup kitchen or other place where food or drink is provided without charge. Businesses and services must, in relation to that activity, have systems and processes in place to,— in on-licence premises or club premises, ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing: in other premises, ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food or drink. All persons who are customers or clients in an on-licence premises or club premises must be seated at a table other than when entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing. All persons who are customers or clients of any other business or service in which food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) must be seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food or drink. Businesses and services must also, in relation to the activity described in subclause (1), have systems and processes in place to— permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time; and ensure that the number of customers or clients seated at a table together does not exceed the maximum number limit (if any) for social gatherings; and ensure that there is at least a 1-metre separation between adjacent tables where customers or clients are seated; and ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that only 1 worker serves at any table; and so far as is reasonably practicable, maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all customers and clients when they are not seated at a table. All persons who are customers or clients at a business or service in which food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) must— be seated at a table together in a number that does not exceed the maximum number limit (if any) for social gatherings: comply so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) when they are not seated at a table. Nothing in this clause applies to— accommodation services selling or providing food or drink for residents (including room service): businesses or services providing food or drink to their workers: vending machines that are located and used within a workplace. A breach of subclause (3), (4), or (6) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the physical distancing requirements for close-proximity businesses and services. In this clause, close-proximity businesses and services means businesses and services to the extent that they carry on activities that they cannot undertake without physical contact, or close proximity, between people (for example, massage and hairdressing services or professional or semi-professional sports). Close-proximity businesses and services must, in relation to that activity, have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. However, subclause (3) does not apply to the extent that workers are required to have physical contact with, or close proximity to, people in order to carry out the activities of that business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a close-proximity business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. However, neither subclause (5) nor the 2-metre physical distancing rule apply to the extent that physical contact, or close proximity, is required between workers and other people in order to carry out the activities of a close-proximity business or service. A breach of subclause (5) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Clauses 39 to 43 do not apply to a gathering of fellow residents. A social gathering must not exceed 100 people in a defined space at any one time. This clause does not apply to any premises referred to in section 12(2)﻿(d) of the Act. Workers who are providing services in relation to a social gathering are not to be counted as part of the number limit for the gathering in clause 39. A person must not attend a social gathering that exceeds the number limit for that gathering specified in clause 39. If clause 43(2) applies to a social gathering, a person who attends the social gathering must— scan the QR code for the social gathering; or provide details in the contact tracing record referred to in that clause. A social gathering that exceeds the number limit for the gathering in clause 39 is prohibited. The people responsible for a social gathering must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed the number limit. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A social gathering in which the requirements in subclause (2) are not met is prohibited. The people responsible for a social gathering must ensure that there are systems and processes in place to ensure that, so far as is reasonably practicable, each person who attends the social gathering— scans the QR code for the social gathering; or provides details in a contact tracing record that is kept by one of the people responsible for or attending the social gathering. Subclause (2) does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purposes of contact tracing, every other person who is a participant in the social gathering. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In relation to how the contact tracing record under subclause (2) is collected, kept, and used, see the requirements in the Privacy Act 2020 that apply to persons collecting personal information. Nothing in this order prevents any person from assisting in, or responding to, an emergency.  Nothing in this order applies— to border services (including law enforcement activities related to border services) provided by Immigration New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, Maritime New Zealand, or the Ministry for Primary Industries: to the provision of health services: to residential centres (including care and protection and youth justice residences), family homes, and group homes (including family group homes and community-based remand centres) that are approved or recognised for the time being by the chief executive of Oranga Tamariki as a place of care or treatment for the purposes of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989: within a corrections prison as defined in section 3(1) of the Corrections Act 2004 or any premises managed by or on behalf of the Department of Corrections: to custodial or detention services managed by the New Zealand Police, the Department of Corrections, or the Ministry of Justice, or within a courthouse: to the administration of sentences and orders by the Department of Corrections or on its behalf: to people being transported for the purposes of the Department of Corrections and New Zealand Police fulfilling their purposes and performing their functions and duties: to the New Zealand Parole Board: to the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service: to the Government Communications Security Bureau: to the New Zealand Defence Force: to the New Zealand Police: to Fire and Emergency New Zealand: to civil defence emergency management services provided by the National Emergency Management Agency and Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups: to managed isolation or quarantine services for COVID-19 or to people while they are required to be in isolation or quarantine in accordance with either of the following: the Isolation and Quarantine Order: the Maritime Border Order: to workers carrying out any business or service referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (o): to people who are enforcement officers carrying out their functions and exercising their powers under the Act. The Director-General may exempt any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods (or any person, business, service, or goods) from the application of any provision of this order or from the requirement to comply with any provision of this order in accordance with this clause. The Director-General may grant an exemption if satisfied that— the exemption is necessary or desirable in order to promote the purposes of the Act or the purposes of this order; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemption. In determining whether the condition in subclause (2)﻿(a) is satisfied for an exemption from clause 17 (restrictions on travel between alert level 3 area and another alert level area), the Director-General must take into account— the extent to which the travel is reasonably necessary, including whether it could reasonably be delayed; and the economic, social, or health benefits associated with the purpose of the travel; and the public health risk associated with the travel and its purpose. The Director-General may impose conditions on the exemption as the Director-General considers necessary. An exemption for any specified person, business, service, or goods must be notified in writing to— the applicant; and in the case of an exemption for any specified person, business, or service, the exempt person or business. An exemption for any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods must— be published on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government; and be notified in the Gazette. The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order 2020 (LI 2020/231) is revoked. In this Part, commencement means the date on and time at which this order commences. This clause applies if, on commencement,— people who are not fellow residents of each other are residing in the same room of an accommodation service; and the number of those people is more than 10 (which is the maximum number of people who may form an accommodation service bubble arrangement); and the room is not large enough to enable compliance with the physical distancing requirements while those people are in the room. The physical distancing requirements do not apply to the extent needed to allow those people to continue residing in that room of the accommodation service. In this clause, physical distancing requirements means the requirements that apply to those people while they are in the accommodation service and— are described in clauses 21 and 23, if the accommodation service is in an alert level 3 area; or are described in clauses 29 and 30, if the accommodation service is in an alert level 2 area. An exemption granted before commencement by the Director-General under a COVID-19 order that is replaced by this order, or to which this order corresponds, has no effect for the purposes of this order.

and the travel is reasonably necessary to enable the specified function to occur (for example, because the function cannot be performed by an appropriate person who is already within the relevant alert level area); and performance of the function cannot reasonably be delayed In this item,— specified function means a function to which 1 or more of the following apply: an enactment requires that the function be performed: the function is necessary to support the response to COVID-19: the function is necessary to preserve the national security of New Zealand: the function is necessary to preserve human life or safety transport-related entity or service provider means any of the following: New Zealand Transport Agency: Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand (including the Aviation Security Service): Airways Corporation of New Zealand Limited: Maritime New Zealand (including the Rescue Coordination Centre New Zealand): KiwiRail Holdings Limited (including Interislander): Transport Accident Investigation Commission: any entity or service provider that is contracted by 1 or more of these entities Building, construction, and maintenance services required for 1 or both of the following: to address immediate risks to health and safety: key infrastructure In this item, key infrastructure means— the key utilities as defined in item 6;

and the travel between alert level areas is reasonably necessary to enable the service to be provided (for example, because the service cannot be provided by an appropriate person who is already within the relevant alert level area); and provision of the service cannot reasonably be delayed (for example, because a delay would breach an obligation under an enactment, risk harm to people or communities, or risk damage to the environment) In this item, State services has the same meaning as in section 5 of the Public Service Act 2020 and local authority has the same meaning as in section 5(1) of the Local Government Act 2002 Veterinary and animal health and welfare services, but only if— a breach of the Animal Welfare Act 1999 could result if the service were not provided;

This order is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order 2021. Most of the order comes into force at 11.59 pm on 14 February 2021. However, clause 18(2), (3)﻿(c), and (4), which requires evidence for certain travel between alert level areas, comes into force at 11.59 pm on 15 February 2021. Part 1 of this order sets out the purpose of this order (see clause 3) and definitions used in the order (see clause 4). The purpose of this order is to prevent, and limit the risk of, the outbreak or spread of COVID-19. Clause 5 provides for how the requirements in this order apply to businesses and services. Clause 6 provides for the description of the alert level 3 area in Schedule 4 and the map of the area in Schedule 5. Clause 7 refers to the transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1. Clause 8 sets out where parts of this order apply, as follows: Part 3 applies in the alert level 3 area, to any property if a part of it is in the alert level 3 area, and to any other place if necessary for the purposes of enforcing the measures in those 2 places (for example, to enable roadblocks). The alert level 3 area means the area described in Schedule 4: Part 4 applies to all areas of New Zealand except to the extent that Part 3 applies: the rest of this order applies to the whole of New Zealand. Clauses 9 and 10 set out requirements for unique identifying codes for the purpose of enabling contact tracing (QR codes). Clause 11 sets out requirements for contact tracing in workplaces. Clauses 12 to 14 set out face covering requirements on public transport services and domestic air transport services, and exemptions from those requirements. Clause 15 describes the 1-metre and 2-metre physical distancing rules. Clause 16 sets out physical distancing requirements on public transport services that travel between alert level areas or through the alert level 3 area. Clause 17 prohibits travel between alert level areas unless the travel is permitted under clause 18. Clause 19 sets out the stay-at-home requirements in the alert level 3 area. All people within that area must— remain at their current home or place of residence except for essential personal movement permitted under clause 20; and if their home is mobile, keep that home in the same general location except for essential personal movement permitted under clause 20. These requirements do not apply to a person while the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine) Order 2020 or the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order (No 2) 2020 applies to that person. Clause 20 sets out movements that are permitted as essential personal movement within the alert level 3 area. These are the reasons for which a person is permitted to leave their current home or place of residence. The permissions relate to— accessing businesses and services: attending education entities: working: limited recreation purposes: limited customary purposes: controlled gatherings: extended bubble arrangements and shared caregiving arrangements: care of children and others and visiting residential disability care: accessing health services: accessing judicial institutions: leaving or relocating home on court order or under another authority: leaving New Zealand: emergencies: relocating home or business premises: going home after isolation or quarantine or arriving in New Zealand: accompanying tūpāpaku or deceased persons: caring for pets or other animals: travelling between alert level areas if permitted under clause 18: assisting fellow residents. Clause 21 requires people to maintain physical distancing so far as is reasonably practicable. For the alert level 3 area, this means staying 2 metres away from other people. There are exceptions for certain businesses or services in which people must stay 1 metre away from other people (see the general requirements in clause 23, as adjusted in clause 24).  Clause 22 requires premises in the alert level 3 area to be closed unless the business or service complies with the alert level 3 requirements (see Part 2 and clauses 23 and 24). The alert level 3 requirements differ, depending on whether the business or service is a category A business or service, a category B business or service, an education entity, a transport station or public transport service, a venue business, or another business or service. Clause 25 prohibits outdoor gatherings in an alert level 3 area, other than in an outdoor place that is a venue used for gatherings that has the relevant alert level 3 requirements in place. Clause 26 permits controlled gatherings in an alert level 3 area, as long as the people responsible for the gathering ensure that contact tracing processes are in place. (People responsible is defined in clause 4.) Clause 27 sets out contact tracing requirements that apply to the people who attend a controlled gathering within an alert level 3 area. Part 4 applies in all areas of New Zealand to which Part 3 does not apply. Part 4 sets out alert level 2 requirements to prevent the outbreak or spread of COVID-19. Clause 28 is an application clause. Clauses 29 to 37 apply to workplaces of businesses and services, except those described in clause 28(1)﻿(a) to (e). Clauses 39 to 43 apply to social gatherings including, but not limited to, gatherings described in clause 28(1)﻿(a) to (e). Clause 29 requires a workplace to have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (so far as is reasonably practicable) for workers; and maintain compliance with the 2-metre physical distancing rule (so far as is reasonably practicable) for other persons entering the workplace of, or using the services of, the business or service; and mitigate risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained (such as through regular cleaning of surfaces or installing plastic barriers). Clause 30 requires a person to comply, so far as is reasonably practicable, with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule, if that rule applies to the person. The requirements in clauses 29 and 30 that relate to the 1-metre physical distancing rule and the 2-metre physical distancing rule apply except to the extent adjusted by clauses 31 to 37. Clause 31 sets out adjusted requirements for category A businesses and services. Clause 32 sets out adjusted requirements for education entities. Clause 33 sets out adjusted requirements for public transport services. Clause 34 sets out adjusted requirements for transport stations. Clause 35 sets out adjusted requirements for controlled-access businesses and services, defined as— businesses or services that have a largely consistent group of workers and that usually have a fixed workplace (such as office workplaces and factories): businesses or services with customers or clients that are members of the business or service (such as gyms): public facilities located within a building or structure (such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums): event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos. However, retail businesses, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway-food stores, and retail stores, are excluded from clause 35. Clause 36 sets out adjusted requirements for businesses or services with workplaces that customers may enter and where food or drink is sold or provided to be consumed there (such as restaurants, cafes, and soup kitchens). Clause 37 sets out adjusted requirements for businesses or services that cannot operate without physical contact or close proximity between people (such as massage and hairdressing services and professional sports). Clauses 38 to 43 relate to social gatherings. (Social gathering is defined in clause 4.) Clause 38 states that the requirements for social gatherings do not apply to gatherings of fellow residents. Clause 39 sets out the number limit for a social gathering in an alert level 2 area. Clause 40 provides that the number limit for a social gathering does not include workers providing services in relation to the gathering. Clause 41 provides that people must not attend a social gathering that exceeds the number limit (not including workers who are providing services in relation to the gathering). Clause 41(2) also provides that people must, if attending a social gathering, comply with requirements to enable contact tracing records to be kept. Clause 42 requires the people responsible for a social gathering to ensure that the social gathering does not exceed the number limit. Clause 43 requires the people responsible for a social gathering to ensure that contact tracing processes are in place. This does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purpose of contact tracing, every other person at the social gathering. Clause 44 exempts people assisting in or responding to an emergency from the application of the order. Clause 45 sets out other exemptions for specified activities and services. Clause 46 empowers the Director-General of Health to grant exemptions from any provision of this order, subject to the Director-General being satisfied that certain criteria are met. Clause 47 revokes the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order 2020. Schedule 1 is for transitional, savings, and related provisions. Schedule 2 describes the category A businesses or services and the category B businesses or services Schedule 3 sets out a list of businesses and services for which travel between alert level areas is permitted for work purposes. Schedule 4 is a description of the alert level 3 area. Schedule 5 is an indicative map of the alert level 3 area. This order must be approved by a resolution of the House of Representatives before the expiry of the period described in section 16(2) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. If this does not happen, the order is revoked on the expiry of that period.

A requirement that applies in relation to a particular activity is a requirement that applies to a business or service to the extent that the activity is carried out by the business or service. If more than 1 business or service operates in the same, or shared, premises (for example, a shopping mall, a marketplace, or a cafe that operates in an office building), each of those businesses and services must comply with all of the requirements in this order to the extent that they apply to that business or service or its activities. The area described in Schedule 3 is the alert level 2 area. The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. Part 3 applies— to the alert level 2 area; and to any property if a part of it is in the alert level 2 area; and to any other place if necessary for the purpose of enforcing the requirements in a place referred to in paragraph (a) or (b). The rest of this order applies to the whole of New Zealand. A person in control of a workplace must ensure that a copy of a QR code for the workplace is displayed in a prominent place at or near the main entrance of the workplace. However, subclause (1)— does not apply if the workplace is a vehicle; and applies to the workplace of a business or service that is in a dwelling house only if— customers or clients of the business or service customarily enter the dwelling house; or workers of the business or service customarily enter the dwelling house (and those workers are not residents of the dwelling house or providing a category A social service). A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person in control of a public transport service must ensure that a copy of a QR code is displayed in a prominent place on or inside any vehicle that is in use as part of that service. However, subclause (1) does not apply in relation to a public transport service if all persons using the service are required to supply their contact details in order to use the service. In subclause (1), public transport service excludes a school transport service. In subclause (2), contact details means— the name of the person; and a telephone number that may be used to easily contact the person. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Every person must wear a face covering while on board a vehicle that is in use as part of a public transport service. However, subclause (1) does not apply— to a person who is a passenger on a small passenger service vehicle; or to a ferry service carrying passengers between the North Island and the South Island; or to air transport; or to a school transport service; or in the circumstances set out in clause 13. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Every person must wear a face covering while on board a vehicle that is in use as part of a domestic air transport service. However, subclause (1) does not apply in the circumstances set out in clause 13. In this clause, domestic air transport service means a public transport service that is transporting persons by air transport between places that are both in New Zealand. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Clauses 11(1) and 12(1) do not apply if— there is an emergency; or wearing a face covering is not safe in all of the circumstances; or the person is in a defined space or an enclosed space that is separate from the passenger area; or the person is communicating with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing and visibility of the mouth is essential for communication; or the person is asked to remove the face covering to ascertain identity; or removal of, or not wearing, the face covering is otherwise required or authorised by law; or the person is under the age of 12 years; or the person has a physical or mental illness or condition or disability that makes wearing a face covering unsuitable; or the person needs to remove the face covering to take medicine; or the person needs to remove the face covering to eat or drink (if eating or drinking is permitted by the conditions of carriage on the relevant service). In addition to the requirement in clause 9(1), a person in control of a workplace must have other record-keeping systems and processes in place to enable a contact tracing record to be kept of,— in the case of a specified workplace, all workers of that workplace entering the workplace: in the case of any other workplace, all persons entering that workplace. Subclause (1) does not apply if the workplace is excluded from the application of clause 9(1). For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(a), specified workplace means— a transport station; or a supermarket; or a petrol station, including any business operating out of the petrol station. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In relation to how the contact tracing record under subclause (1) is collected, kept, and used, see the requirements in the Privacy Act 2020 that apply to persons collecting personal information. In this order, the 1-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 1 metre away from any other person; but applies only if the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) applies to each person referred to in paragraph (a) (for example, if both persons are workers); and does not apply to— a person in relation to their fellow residents; or a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace. In this order, the 2-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 2 metres away from any other person; but does not apply to— a person in relation to their fellow residents; or a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace. Clauses 17 to 25 apply to workplaces of businesses and services, but do not apply to— voluntary or not-for-profit sporting, recreational, social, or cultural activities; or community club activities (except activities that occur at the same time and place as services provided under a club licence under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012); or faith-based gatherings; or households carrying out family activities involving only fellow residents; or a gathering held at a facility or venue of a business or service that has been hired for the gathering if the gathering is not for the purpose of the business or service. See clauses 27 to 31, which contain requirements relating to social gatherings (including those described in subclause (1)﻿(a) to (e)). However, nothing in this Part applies to a school transport service. A business or service must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all workers in a workplace of, or while working for, the business or service; and maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 2-metre physical distancing rule for any other persons entering a workplace, or using the services, of the business or service; and mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained (for example, through regular cleaning of surfaces or the installation of plastic barriers). Subclause (1)﻿(a) and (b) applies except to the extent adjusted by clauses 19 to 25. All workers of a business or service in the workplace of, or while working for, the business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. All other persons who enter a workplace of, or use the services of, a business or service must comply with the 2-metre physical distancing rule so far as is reasonably practicable. Subclauses (1) and (2) apply except to the extent adjusted by clauses 19 to 25. A breach of subclause (1) or (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for category A businesses and services. Category A businesses and services must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a category A business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for education entities. Education entities— need not have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for people who are ordinarily at the education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services; but must have systems and processes in place to mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that compliance with the physical distancing requirements that would otherwise apply under this Part to the workplace or service is not fully maintained (for example, regular cleaning of surfaces). People who are ordinarily at an education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services are not required to comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule. The adjustment in subclause (2) and the exemption from physical distancing in subclause (3) do not apply to— inter-school activities; or activities at (or connected with) an education entity that are attended by people who are otherwise not ordinarily at that education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for public transport services. Public transport services need not have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a public transport service are not required to comply with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for transport stations. Transport stations must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a transport station must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for controlled-access businesses and services. In this clause, controlled-access businesses and services— means the following businesses and services: businesses and services to the extent that they largely have a consistent group of workers and usually have a fixed workplace, such as office workplaces and factories; and businesses and services to the extent that their customers or clients are members of the business or service, such as gyms; and public facilities that are located within a building or structure, such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums; and event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos; but excludes retail businesses, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway-food stores, and retail stores. Controlled-access businesses and services must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service; and if they are an event facility, permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the facility at any 1 time (not including workers). All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a controlled-access business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (4) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for businesses or services to the extent that customers or clients enter their workplaces and food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) to those customers or clients in the workplace, such as— a restaurant or cafe; or a soup kitchen or other place where food or drink is provided without charge. Businesses and services must, in relation to that activity, have systems and processes in place to,— in on-licence premises or club premises, ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing: in other premises, ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food or drink. All persons who are customers or clients in an on-licence premises or club premises must be seated at a table other than when entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing. All persons who are customers or clients of any other business or service in which food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) must be seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food or drink. Businesses and services must also, in relation to the activity described in subclause (1), have systems and processes in place to— permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time; and ensure that the number of customers or clients seated at a table together does not exceed the maximum number limit (if any) for social gatherings; and ensure that there is at least a 1-metre separation between adjacent tables where customers or clients are seated; and ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that only 1 worker serves at any table; and so far as is reasonably practicable, maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all customers and clients when they are not seated at a table. All persons who are customers or clients at a business or service in which food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) must— be seated at a table together in a number that does not exceed the maximum number limit (if any) for social gatherings: comply so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) when they are not seated at a table. Nothing in this clause applies to— accommodation services selling or providing food or drink for residents (including room service): businesses or services providing food or drink to their workers: vending machines that are located and used within a workplace. A breach of subclause (3), (4), or (6) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the physical distancing requirements for close-proximity businesses and services. In this clause, close-proximity businesses and services means businesses and services to the extent that they carry on activities that they cannot undertake without physical contact, or close proximity, between people (for example, massage and hairdressing services or professional or semi-professional sports). Close-proximity businesses and services must, in relation to that activity, have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. However, subclause (3) does not apply to the extent that workers are required to have physical contact with, or close proximity to, people in order to carry out the activities of that business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a close-proximity business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. However, neither subclause (5) nor the 2-metre physical distancing rule apply to the extent that physical contact, or close proximity, is required between workers and other people in order to carry out the activities of a close-proximity business or service. A breach of subclause (5) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Clauses 27 to 31 do not apply to a gathering of fellow residents. A social gathering must not exceed 100 people in a defined space at any one time. This clause does not apply to any premises referred to in section 12(2)﻿(d) of the Act. Workers who are providing services in relation to a social gathering are not to be counted as part of the number limit for the gathering in clause 27. A person must not attend a social gathering that exceeds the number limit for that gathering specified in clause 27. If clause 31(2) applies to a social gathering, a person who attends the social gathering must— scan the QR code for the social gathering; or provide details in the contact tracing record referred to in that clause. A social gathering that exceeds the number limit for the gathering in clause 27 is prohibited. The people responsible for a social gathering must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed the number limit.

For the purpose of the definition of defined space in subclause (1),—  an indoor space or outdoor space is a single space if there are walls (whether permanent or temporary) that substantially divide that space from other spaces: an outdoor space is also a single space if there is at least 2 metres that separates all people in that space from other people who are outside that space. A reference in this order to a requirement applying to a business or service applies that requirement to the person who carries on that business or service. A requirement that applies in relation to a particular activity is a requirement that applies to a business or service to the extent that the activity is carried out by the business or service. If more than 1 business or service operates in the same, or shared, premises (for example, a shopping mall, a marketplace, or a cafe that operates in an office building), each of those businesses and services must comply with all of the requirements in this order to the extent that they apply to that business or service or its activities. The area described in Schedule 4 is the alert level 3 area. An indicative map of the alert level 3 area is set out in Schedule 5. If there is any inconsistency between the description under subclause (1) and the map, the description prevails. The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. Part 3 applies— to the alert level 3 area; and to any property if a part of it is in the alert level 3 area; and to any other place if necessary for the purpose of enforcing the requirements in a place referred to in paragraph (a) or (b). Part 4 applies to all areas of New Zealand except to the extent that Part 3 applies. The rest of this order applies to the whole of New Zealand. A person in control of a workplace must ensure that a copy of a QR code for the workplace is displayed in a prominent place at or near the main entrance of the workplace. However, subclause (1)— does not apply if the workplace is a vehicle; and applies to the workplace of a business or service that is in a dwelling house only if— customers or clients of the business or service customarily enter the dwelling house; or workers of the business or service customarily enter the dwelling house (and those workers are not residents of the dwelling house or providing a category A social service). A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person in control of a public transport service must ensure that a copy of a QR code is displayed in a prominent place on or inside any vehicle that is in use as part of that service. However, subclause (1) does not apply in relation to a public transport service if all persons using the service are required to supply their contact details in order to use the service. In subclause (1), public transport service excludes a school transport service. In subclause (2), contact details means— the name of the person; and a telephone number that may be used to easily contact the person. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In addition to the requirement in clause 9(1), a person in control of a workplace must have other record-keeping systems and processes in place to enable a contact tracing record to be kept of,— in the case of a specified workplace, all workers of that workplace entering the workplace: in the case of any other workplace, all persons entering that workplace. Subclause (1) does not apply if the workplace is excluded from the application of clause 9(1). For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(a), specified workplace means— a transport station; or a supermarket; or a petrol station, including any business operating out of the petrol station. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In relation to how the contact tracing record under subclause (1) is collected, kept, and used, see the requirements in the Privacy Act 2020 that apply to persons collecting personal information. See also additional requirements for contact tracing in clause 24(1)﻿(f) and (g). Every person must wear a face covering while on board a vehicle that is in use as part of a public transport service. However, subclause (1) does not apply— to a person who is a passenger on a small passenger service vehicle; or to a ferry service carrying passengers between the North Island and the South Island; or to air transport; or to a school transport service; or in the circumstances set out in clause 14. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Every person must wear a face covering while on board a vehicle that is in use as part of a domestic air transport service. However, subclause (1) does not apply in the circumstances set out in clause 14. In this clause, domestic air transport service means a public transport service that is transporting persons by air transport between places that are both in New Zealand. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Clauses 12(1) and 13(1) do not apply if— there is an emergency; or wearing a face covering is not safe in all of the circumstances; or the person is in a defined space or an enclosed space that is separate from the passenger area; or the person is communicating with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing and visibility of the mouth is essential for communication; or the person is asked to remove the face covering to ascertain identity; or removal of, or not wearing, the face covering is otherwise required or authorised by law; or the person is under the age of 12 years; or the person has a physical or mental illness or condition or disability that makes wearing a face covering unsuitable; or the person needs to remove the face covering to take medicine; or the person needs to remove the face covering to eat or drink (if eating or drinking is permitted by the conditions of carriage on the relevant service). In this order, the 1-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 1 metre away from any other person; but applies only if the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) applies to each person referred to in paragraph (a) (for example, if both persons are workers); and does not apply to— a person in relation to their fellow residents (in any alert level area); or a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace (in an alert level area that is not an alert level 3 area). In this order, the 2-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 2 metres away from any other person; but does not apply to— a person in relation to their fellow residents (in any alert level area); or a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace (in an alert level area that is not an alert level 3 area). If a vehicle that is in use as part of a public transport service travels on a specified route, clause 24(1)﻿(d) or (e) applies in respect of the entire specified route taken by that vehicle. In this clause, specified route means a route that involves a vehicle travelling— from the alert level 3 area to the alert level 2 area; or to and from the alert level 2 area, if the vehicle passes through the alert level 3 area; or from the alert level 2 area to the alert level 3 area. This clause does not apply to— a school transport service; or travel that takes place only within the alert level 2 area (see clause 33). A person may go into an alert level 3 area from another alert level area, or go out of an alert level 3 area into another alert level area, only if— that travel is for 1 or more of the purposes permitted under clause 18; and the person, so far as is reasonably practicable, travels directly without stopping (except for a permitted airport transfer) while in the alert level 3 area. For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(b), a permitted airport transfer is a stop by a person at an airport for the purpose of transferring to an aircraft to go to another place in New Zealand or outside New Zealand if— the person does not leave the airport except to board a departing flight or to stay in temporary accommodation; and the person’s departing flight is scheduled to depart within 24 hours after the person enters the airport. For the purposes of clause 17, a person is permitted to go into, or out of, the alert level 3 area (but not into, through, and out of the alert level 3 area in 1 trip) for 1 or more of the following purposes: to go to, return from, or carry out work for a business or service listed in Schedule 3 (and, if necessary, stay in no more than 1 place as temporary accommodation): if the person is a worker referred to in clause 45(p) or (q), to go to and return from work (and, if necessary, stay in no more than 1 place as temporary accommodation): if the person is a child, to go to, or return from, the home or place of residence of a shared caregiver (and then visit or stay), whether or not it is the child’s principal home or place of residence: if the person is a shared caregiver or fellow resident of a child, to accompany the child going to, or returning from, the home or place of residence of a shared caregiver or to collect a child for that purpose: to provide urgent care for a child, or to provide care or support to a person in a critical or terminal condition, if no other appropriate person is able to provide that care or support in the alert level area in which it is needed: to go to an appointment with a health service: to attend a court, tribunal, New Zealand Parole Board hearing, or other judicial institution that they are required or permitted to attend by that institution: to— leave or change the person’s home or place of residence as required by a court order or by a person exercising any other power under any enactment to order a person to be detained, to change their place of detention, or otherwise determine their place of residence (for example, a direction of the New Zealand Parole Board or a probation officer); or go to a home or place of residence after that detention or determination ceases: if leaving New Zealand for another jurisdiction, to go to— an airport or a port from which the person will leave New Zealand; or any managed isolation or quarantine facility immediately before leaving New Zealand: if it is necessary to preserve their own or any other person’s life or safety: to go to the person’s principal home or place of residence: to relocate their home or place of residence or business premises on a permanent or long-term basis: to go to the person’s principal home or place of residence (or intended principal home or place of residence) in New Zealand following— the completion of their period of isolation or quarantine under the Isolation and Quarantine Order or the Maritime Border Order; or their arrival in New Zealand, if the Isolation and Quarantine Order and Maritime Border Order do not apply to the person on their arrival: to collect a person referred to in paragraph (m) for the purpose of accompanying them to their principal home or place of residence (or intended principal home or place of residence) in New Zealand: to collect or accompany a tūpāpaku or deceased person, but only if the total number of people collecting or accompanying the tūpāpaku or deceased person (including the person operating the vehicle) is no more than 10: to provide care, or enable care to be provided, for pets or other animals, but only if— a breach of the Animal Welfare Act 1999 could result if the care were not provided; and the travel between alert level areas is necessary to provide the care or enable it to be provided: to accompany any person referred to in paragraphs (a) to (p), but only if it is reasonably necessary for them to accompany that person. A person who relies on a permission under any of the following provisions must carry evidence of the purpose of their travel and the location of their destination: subclause (1)﻿(a) or (b) (working for certain businesses or services): subclause (1)﻿(f) (accessing health services with appointment): subclause (1)﻿(g) (accessing judicial institutions if required or permitted): subclause (1)﻿(h) (leaving or relocating home on court order, etc): subclause (1)﻿(i) (leaving New Zealand): subclause (1)﻿(k) (going home): subclause (1)﻿(l) (relocating home or business premises): subclause (1)﻿(m) (going home after isolation or quarantine (or arrival)). For the purposes of clause 17, a person may go into, through, and out of the alert level 3 area (in 1 trip) for the purpose of going to, or returning from, work or going to the person’s principal home or place of residence if— neither the place of departure nor the destination is in the alert level 3 area; and it is necessary to travel through the alert level 3 area for that purpose; and the person carries evidence of the purpose of their travel and the location of their destination. The evidence required by subclause (2) or (3) may (but need not) be or include a document issued by the New Zealand Government for the purposes of this clause. The permissions in this clause do not apply to travel that takes place only within the alert level 3 area (to which clause 20 applies). All persons in the alert level 3 area must— remain at their current home or place of residence, except for essential personal movement permitted under clause 20; and if their home or place of residence is mobile, keep that home or place of residence in the same general location, except to the extent that they would be permitted (if it were not mobile) under clause 20 to leave the home or place of residence as essential personal movement. A breach of subclause (1)﻿(a) or (b) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person is permitted to do any of the following as essential personal movement within the alert level 3 area: leave their home or place of residence to access any business or service operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements if doing so for their own needs or on behalf of a fellow resident, a vulnerable person, or a high-risk person: leave their home or place of residence to attend any education entity if permitted to do so by the entity in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements: leave their home or place of residence to provide a business or service operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements (or to do necessary work at any premises under clause 22(2)): if they are a worker referred to in clause 45(p) or (q), leave their home or place of residence to go to, or return from, work: leave their home or place of residence to work at an education entity operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements: leave their home or place of residence for exercise or other recreation if— it is done in an outdoor place appropriate for that kind of exercise or recreation that is readily accessible (including by using their vehicle) from their home or place of residence; and it is done in compliance with the requirements that relate to physical distancing (see clause 21) and the prohibition against gathering in outdoor places (see clause 25); and it does not involve flying manned aircraft, scuba-diving, hunting in motorised vehicles, or water-based activities involving sailing boats, motorised craft, or motorised equipment; and it does not involve any other activities that expose the participant to danger (taking account of their experience and abilities): leave their home or place of residence to exercise Māori customary rights to fishing and food gathering if— it is done in an outdoor place that is readily accessible (including by using their vehicle) from their home or place of residence; and it is done in compliance with the requirements that relate to physical distancing (see clause 21) and the prohibition against gathering in outdoor places (see clause 25); and it does not involve flying manned aircraft, scuba-diving, hunting in motorised vehicles, or water-based activities involving sailing boats, motorised craft, or motorised equipment;

All persons in the alert level 3 area must comply with the 2-metre physical distancing rule so far as is reasonably practicable. Subclause (1) is subject to subclauses (3), (4), (5), and (6). All workers of a business or service in the workplace of, or while working for, the business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. All persons who enter a workplace of, use the services of, or work for any of the following businesses or services must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable: a category A business or service: an education entity: a transport station: a public transport service (other than one provided by means of air transport or a small passenger service vehicle). All persons who enter a workplace of, use the services of, or work for a public transport service provided by means of air transport or a small passenger service vehicle must maintain physical distancing so far as is reasonably practicable. The 2-metre physical distancing rule and the 1-metre physical distancing rule do not apply to a school transport service. A breach of subclause (1), (3), or (4) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person in control of premises in the alert level 3 area must close those premises unless the person is carrying on a business or service that is operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements. However,— this clause does not prevent a person from undertaking any necessary work in any premises for either of the following purposes: minimum basic operations required to— maintain the condition or value of, or clean, the premises or any plant, equipment, or goods in the premises: care for animals: receive stock or freight (including livestock): enable workers to work, or to continue to work, remotely from their homes or places of residence: to prepare the premises for opening (and to meet public health guidance); and this clause does not apply to any premises referred to in section 12(2)﻿(c) or (d) of the Act; and this clause and clauses 23 and 24 do not apply to a school transport service. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A business or service must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all workers in a workplace of, or while working for, the business or service; and maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 2-metre physical distancing rule for any other persons entering a workplace, or using the services, of the business or service; and mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained (for example, through regular cleaning of surfaces or the installation of plastic barriers). Subclause (1)﻿(a) and (b) applies except to the extent adjusted by clause 24. A business or service must operate in compliance with the following alert level 3 requirements: a category A business or service must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service: a category B business or service must have systems and processes in place to prevent food and drink from being served for consumption on the premises (unless the service is an accommodation service): an education entity must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service; and keep children, students, and teachers, so far as is reasonably practicable, in groups that are appropriately sized and stable; and for schools, limit students’ physical attendance to students in years 1 to 10 and, for other students, as otherwise permitted by any direction given by the chief executive of the Ministry of Education under Schedule 25 of the Education and Training Act 2020: a transport station and a public transport service (other than one provided by means of air transport or a small passenger service vehicle) must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service: a public transport service provided by means of air transport or a small passenger service vehicle must have systems and processes in place to maintain physical distancing so far as is reasonably practicable for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service: a venue business must have systems and processes in place to ensure that— the venue workplace is used only for the purpose of a controlled gathering; and so far as is reasonably practicable, each person who enters the venue workplace— scans the QR code for the workplace; or provides details in a contact tracing record that the person in control of the venue workplace collects:  all businesses and services other than those referred to in paragraphs (a) to (f) must have systems and processes in place to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable that— no customers or clients enter the workplace (other than only, and then to the minimum extent necessary, to collect goods through a method that minimises physical contact and does not involve— entering a building; or in the case of a shopping mall, entering an individual store); and there is no close personal contact with or between customers or clients; and each person who enters the workplace— scans the QR code for the workplace; or provides details in a contact tracing record that the person in control of the workplace collects.  If subclause (1)﻿(f)﻿(ii) or (g)﻿(iii) applies, the person in control of the workplace must keep the contact tracing record for a period of 30 days. Subclause (1)﻿(f)﻿(ii) and (g)﻿(iii) does not apply to a workplace that is excluded from the application of clause 9(1). A person must not attend a gathering in any outdoor place in an alert level 3 area. A person must not organise a gathering in any outdoor place in an alert level 3 area. This clause does not apply to— a gathering of fellow residents; or a gathering organised by a venue business operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements; or a controlled gathering (see clause 26); or any premises referred to in section 12(2)﻿(d) of the Act. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A controlled gathering is permitted in an alert level 3 area, but only if the requirements in subclause (2) are met. The people responsible for a controlled gathering in an alert level 3 area must ensure that there are systems and processes in place to ensure that, so far as is reasonably practicable, each person who attends the controlled gathering— scans the QR code for the controlled gathering; or provides details in a contact tracing record that is kept by one of the people responsible for or attending the controlled gathering. Subclause (2) does not apply if every person at the controlled gathering knows, and can identify for the purposes of contact tracing, every other person who is attending the controlled gathering. Subclauses (1) and (2) do not apply to a gathering organised by a venue business operating in compliance with the alert level 3 requirements. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In relation to how the contact tracing record under subclause (2) is collected, kept, and used, see the requirements in the Privacy Act 2020 that apply to persons collecting personal information. In this clause, controlled gathering means a gathering that meets all of the following requirements: there are no more than 10 people at any one time at the gathering (including any celebrant, organiser, or other assistant); and the gathering is for one of the following purposes: a funeral service: a tangihanga: a wedding or civil union service; and the gathering is one at which no food or drink is served. If clause 26(2) applies to a controlled gathering, a person who attends the controlled gathering must— scan the QR code for the controlled gathering; or provide details in the contact tracing record referred to in that clause. Clauses 29 to 37 apply to workplaces of businesses and services, but do not apply to— voluntary or not-for-profit sporting, recreational, social, or cultural activities; or community club activities (except activities that occur at the same time and place as services provided under a club licence under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012); or faith-based gatherings; or households carrying out family activities involving only fellow residents; or a gathering held at a facility or venue of a business or service that has been hired for the gathering if the gathering is not for the purpose of the business or service. See clauses 39 to 43, which contain requirements relating to social gatherings (including those described in subclause (1)﻿(a) to (e)). However, nothing in this Part applies to a school transport service. A business or service must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all workers in a workplace of, or while working for, the business or service; and maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 2-metre physical distancing rule for any other persons entering a workplace, or using the services, of the business or service; and mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained (for example, through regular cleaning of surfaces or the installation of plastic barriers). Subclause (1)﻿(a) and (b) applies except to the extent adjusted by clauses 31 to 37. All workers of a business or service in the workplace of, or while working for, the business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. All other persons who enter a workplace of, or use the services of, a business or service must comply with the 2-metre physical distancing rule so far as is reasonably practicable. Subclauses (1) and (2) apply except to the extent adjusted by clauses 31 to 37. A breach of subclause (1) or (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for category A businesses and services. Category A businesses and services must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a category A business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for education entities. Education entities— need not have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for people who are ordinarily at the education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services; but must have systems and processes in place to mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that compliance with the physical distancing requirements that would otherwise apply under this Part to the workplace or service is not fully maintained (for example, regular cleaning of surfaces). People who are ordinarily at an education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services are not required to comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule. The adjustment in subclause (2) and the exemption from physical distancing in subclause (3) do not apply to— inter-school activities; or activities at (or connected with) an education entity that are attended by people who are otherwise not ordinarily at that education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for public transport services. Public transport services need not have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a public transport service are not required to comply with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule. See, however, clause 16 if the vehicle travels on a specified route described in that clause. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for transport stations. Transport stations must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a transport station must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for controlled-access businesses and services. In this clause, controlled-access businesses and services— means the following businesses and services: businesses and services to the extent that they largely have a consistent group of workers and usually have a fixed workplace, such as office workplaces and factories; and businesses and services to the extent that their customers or clients are members of the business or service, such as gyms; and public facilities that are located within a building or structure, such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums; and event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos; but excludes retail businesses, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway-food stores, and retail stores. Controlled-access businesses and services must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service; and if they are an event facility, permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the facility at any 1 time (not including workers). All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a controlled-access business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (4) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for businesses or services to the extent that customers or clients enter their workplaces and food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) to those customers or clients in the workplace, such as— a restaurant or cafe; or a soup kitchen or other place where food or drink is provided without charge. Businesses and services must, in relation to that activity, have systems and processes in place to,— in on-licence premises or club premises, ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing: in other premises, ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food or drink. All persons who are customers or clients in an on-licence premises or club premises must be seated at a table other than when entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing. All persons who are customers or clients of any other business or service in which food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) must be seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food or drink. Businesses and services must also, in relation to the activity described in subclause (1), have systems and processes in place to— permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time; and ensure that the number of customers or clients seated at a table together does not exceed the maximum number limit (if any) for social gatherings; and ensure that there is at least a 1-metre separation between adjacent tables where customers or clients are seated; and ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that only 1 worker serves at any table; and so far as is reasonably practicable, maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all customers and clients when they are not seated at a table. All persons who are customers or clients at a business or service in which food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) must— be seated at a table together in a number that does not exceed the maximum number limit (if any) for social gatherings: comply so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) when they are not seated at a table. Nothing in this clause applies to— accommodation services selling or providing food or drink for residents (including room service): businesses or services providing food or drink to their workers: vending machines that are located and used within a workplace. A breach of subclause (3), (4), or (6) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the physical distancing requirements for close-proximity businesses and services. In this clause, close-proximity businesses and services means businesses and services to the extent that they carry on activities that they cannot undertake without physical contact, or close proximity, between people (for example, massage and hairdressing services or professional or semi-professional sports). Close-proximity businesses and services must, in relation to that activity, have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. However, subclause (3) does not apply to the extent that workers are required to have physical contact with, or close proximity to, people in order to carry out the activities of that business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a close-proximity business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. However, neither subclause (5) nor the 2-metre physical distancing rule apply to the extent that physical contact, or close proximity, is required between workers and other people in order to carry out the activities of a close-proximity business or service. A breach of subclause (5) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Clauses 39 to 43 do not apply to a gathering of fellow residents. A social gathering must not exceed 100 people in a defined space at any one time. This clause does not apply to any premises referred to in section 12(2)﻿(d) of the Act. Workers who are providing services in relation to a social gathering are not to be counted as part of the number limit for the gathering in clause 39. A person must not attend a social gathering that exceeds the number limit for that gathering specified in clause 39. If clause 43(2) applies to a social gathering, a person who attends the social gathering must— scan the QR code for the social gathering; or provide details in the contact tracing record referred to in that clause. A social gathering that exceeds the number limit for the gathering in clause 39 is prohibited. The people responsible for a social gathering must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed the number limit. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A social gathering in which the requirements in subclause (2) are not met is prohibited. The people responsible for a social gathering must ensure that there are systems and processes in place to ensure that, so far as is reasonably practicable, each person who attends the social gathering— scans the QR code for the social gathering; or provides details in a contact tracing record that is kept by one of the people responsible for or attending the social gathering. Subclause (2) does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purposes of contact tracing, every other person who is a participant in the social gathering. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In relation to how the contact tracing record under subclause (2) is collected, kept, and used, see the requirements in the Privacy Act 2020 that apply to persons collecting personal information. Nothing in this order prevents any person from assisting in, or responding to, an emergency.  Nothing in this order applies— to border services (including law enforcement activities related to border services) provided by Immigration New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, Maritime New Zealand, or the Ministry for Primary Industries: to the provision of health services: to residential centres (including care and protection and youth justice residences), family homes, and group homes (including family group homes and community-based remand centres) that are approved or recognised for the time being by the chief executive of Oranga Tamariki as a place of care or treatment for the purposes of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989: within a corrections prison as defined in section 3(1) of the Corrections Act 2004 or any premises managed by or on behalf of the Department of Corrections: to custodial or detention services managed by the New Zealand Police, the Department of Corrections, or the Ministry of Justice, or within a courthouse: to the administration of sentences and orders by the Department of Corrections or on its behalf: to people being transported for the purposes of the Department of Corrections and New Zealand Police fulfilling their purposes and performing their functions and duties: to the New Zealand Parole Board: to the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service: to the Government Communications Security Bureau: to the New Zealand Defence Force: to the New Zealand Police: to Fire and Emergency New Zealand: to civil defence emergency management services provided by the National Emergency Management Agency and Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups: to managed isolation or quarantine services for COVID-19 or to people while they are required to be in isolation or quarantine in accordance with either of the following: the Isolation and Quarantine Order: the Maritime Border Order: to workers carrying out any business or service referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (o): to people who are enforcement officers carrying out their functions and exercising their powers under the Act. The Director-General may exempt any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods (or any person, business, service, or goods) from the application of any provision of this order or from the requirement to comply with any provision of this order in accordance with this clause. The Director-General may grant an exemption if satisfied that— the exemption is necessary or desirable in order to promote the purposes of the Act or the purposes of this order; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemption. In determining whether the condition in subclause (2)﻿(a) is satisfied for an exemption from clause 17 (restrictions on travel between alert level 3 area and another alert level area), the Director-General must take into account— the extent to which the travel is reasonably necessary, including whether it could reasonably be delayed; and the economic, social, or health benefits associated with the purpose of the travel; and the public health risk associated with the travel and its purpose. The Director-General may impose conditions on the exemption as the Director-General considers necessary. An exemption for any specified person, business, service, or goods must be notified in writing to— the applicant; and in the case of an exemption for any specified person, business, or service, the exempt person or business. An exemption for any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods must— be published on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government; and be notified in the Gazette. The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 3) 2021 (LI 2021/13) is revoked. In this Part, commencement means the date on and time at which this order commences. This clause applies if, on commencement,— people who are not fellow residents of each other are residing in the same room of an accommodation service; and the number of those people is more than 10 (which is the maximum number of people who may form an accommodation service bubble arrangement); and the room is not large enough to enable compliance with the physical distancing requirements while those people are in the room. The physical distancing requirements do not apply to the extent needed to allow those people to continue residing in that room of the accommodation service. In this clause, physical distancing requirements means the requirements that apply to those people while they are in the accommodation service and— are described in clauses 21 and 23, if the accommodation service is in an alert level 3 area; or are described in clauses 29 and 30, if the accommodation service is in an alert level 2 area.

This order is the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 4) 2021. Most of the order comes into force at 6 am on 28 February 2021. However, clause 18(2), (3)﻿(c), and (4), which requires evidence for certain travel between alert level areas, comes into force at 6 am on 1 March 2021. Part 1 of this order sets out the purpose of this order (see clause 3) and definitions used in the order (see clause 4). The purpose of this order is to prevent, and limit the risk of, the outbreak or spread of COVID-19. Clause 5 provides for how the requirements in this order apply to businesses and services. Clause 6 provides for the description of the alert level 3 area in Schedule 4 and the map of the area in Schedule 5. Clause 7 refers to the transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1. Clause 8 sets out where parts of this order apply, as follows: Part 3 applies in the alert level 3 area, to any property if a part of it is in the alert level 3 area, and to any other place if necessary for the purposes of enforcing the measures in those 2 places (for example, to enable roadblocks). The alert level 3 area means the area described in Schedule 4: Part 4 applies to all areas of New Zealand except to the extent that Part 3 applies: the rest of this order applies to the whole of New Zealand. Clauses 9 and 10 set out requirements for unique identifying codes for the purpose of enabling contact tracing (QR codes). Clause 11 sets out requirements for contact tracing in workplaces. Clauses 12 to 14 set out face covering requirements on public transport services and domestic air transport services, and exemptions from those requirements. Clause 15 describes the 1-metre and 2-metre physical distancing rules. Clause 16 sets out physical distancing requirements on public transport services that travel between alert level areas or through the alert level 3 area. Clause 17 prohibits travel between alert level areas unless the travel is permitted under clause 18. Clause 19 sets out the stay-at-home requirements in the alert level 3 area. All people within that area must— remain at their current home or place of residence except for essential personal movement permitted under clause 20; and if their home is mobile, keep that home in the same general location except for essential personal movement permitted under clause 20. These requirements do not apply to a person while the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine) Order 2020 or the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order (No 2) 2020 applies to that person. Clause 20 sets out movements that are permitted as essential personal movement within the alert level 3 area. These are the reasons for which a person is permitted to leave their current home or place of residence. The permissions relate to— accessing businesses and services: attending education entities: working: limited recreation purposes: limited customary purposes: controlled gatherings: extended bubble arrangements and shared caregiving arrangements: care of children and others and visiting residential disability care: accessing health services: accessing judicial institutions: leaving or relocating home on court order or under another authority: leaving New Zealand: emergencies: relocating home or business premises: going home after isolation or quarantine or arriving in New Zealand: accompanying tūpāpaku or deceased persons: caring for pets or other animals: travelling between alert level areas if permitted under clause 18: assisting fellow residents. Clause 21 requires people to maintain physical distancing so far as is reasonably practicable. For the alert level 3 area, this means staying 2 metres away from other people. There are exceptions for certain businesses or services in which people must stay 1 metre away from other people (see the general requirements in clause 23, as adjusted in clause 24).  Clause 22 requires premises in the alert level 3 area to be closed unless the business or service complies with the alert level 3 requirements (see Part 2 and clauses 23 and 24). The alert level 3 requirements differ, depending on whether the business or service is a category A business or service, a category B business or service, an education entity, a transport station or public transport service, a venue business, or another business or service. Clause 25 prohibits outdoor gatherings in an alert level 3 area, other than in an outdoor place that is a venue used for gatherings that has the relevant alert level 3 requirements in place. Clause 26 permits controlled gatherings in an alert level 3 area, as long as the people responsible for the gathering ensure that contact tracing processes are in place. (People responsible is defined in clause 4.) Clause 27 sets out contact tracing requirements that apply to the people who attend a controlled gathering within an alert level 3 area. Part 4 applies in all areas of New Zealand to which Part 3 does not apply. Part 4 sets out alert level 2 requirements to prevent the outbreak or spread of COVID-19. Clause 28 is an application clause. Clauses 29 to 37 apply to workplaces of businesses and services, except those described in clause 28(1)﻿(a) to (e). Clauses 39 to 43 apply to social gatherings including, but not limited to, gatherings described in clause 28(1)﻿(a) to (e). Clause 29 requires a workplace to have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (so far as is reasonably practicable) for workers; and maintain compliance with the 2-metre physical distancing rule (so far as is reasonably practicable) for other persons entering the workplace of, or using the services of, the business or service; and mitigate risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained (such as through regular cleaning of surfaces or installing plastic barriers). Clause 30 requires a person to comply, so far as is reasonably practicable, with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule, if that rule applies to the person. The requirements in clauses 29 and 30 that relate to the 1-metre physical distancing rule and the 2-metre physical distancing rule apply except to the extent adjusted by clauses 31 to 37. Clause 31 sets out adjusted requirements for category A businesses and services. Clause 32 sets out adjusted requirements for education entities. Clause 33 sets out adjusted requirements for public transport services. Clause 34 sets out adjusted requirements for transport stations. Clause 35 sets out adjusted requirements for controlled-access businesses and services, defined as— businesses or services that have a largely consistent group of workers and that usually have a fixed workplace (such as office workplaces and factories): businesses or services with customers or clients that are members of the business or service (such as gyms): public facilities located within a building or structure (such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums): event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos. However, retail businesses, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway-food stores, and retail stores, are excluded from clause 35. Clause 36 sets out adjusted requirements for businesses or services with workplaces that customers may enter and where food or drink is sold or provided to be consumed there (such as restaurants, cafes, and soup kitchens). Clause 37 sets out adjusted requirements for businesses or services that cannot operate without physical contact or close proximity between people (such as massage and hairdressing services and professional sports). Clauses 38 to 43 relate to social gatherings. (Social gathering is defined in clause 4.) Clause 38 states that the requirements for social gatherings do not apply to gatherings of fellow residents. Clause 39 sets out the number limit for a social gathering in an alert level 2 area. Clause 40 provides that the number limit for a social gathering does not include workers providing services in relation to the gathering. Clause 41 provides that people must not attend a social gathering that exceeds the number limit (not including workers who are providing services in relation to the gathering). Clause 41(2) also provides that people must, if attending a social gathering, comply with requirements to enable contact tracing records to be kept. Clause 42 requires the people responsible for a social gathering to ensure that the social gathering does not exceed the number limit. Clause 43 requires the people responsible for a social gathering to ensure that contact tracing processes are in place. This does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purpose of contact tracing, every other person at the social gathering. Clause 44 exempts people assisting in or responding to an emergency from the application of the order. Clause 45 sets out other exemptions for specified activities and services. Clause 46 empowers the Director-General of Health to grant exemptions from any provision of this order, subject to the Director-General being satisfied that certain criteria are met.

A reference in this order to a requirement applying to a business or service applies that requirement to the person who carries on that business or service. A requirement that applies in relation to a particular activity is a requirement that applies to a business or service to the extent that the activity is carried out by the business or service. If more than 1 business or service operates in the same, or shared, premises (for example, a shopping mall, a marketplace, or a cafe that operates in an office building), each of those businesses and services must comply with all of the requirements in this order to the extent that they apply to that business or service or its activities. The area described in Schedule 3 is the alert level 2 area. An indicative map of the alert level 2 area is set out in Schedule 4. If there is any inconsistency between the description under subclause (1) and the map, the description prevails. The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. Part 3 applies— to the alert level 2 area; and to any property if a part of it is in the alert level 2 area; and to any other place if necessary for the purpose of enforcing the requirements in a place referred to in paragraph (a) or (b). The rest of this order applies to the whole of New Zealand. A person in control of a workplace must ensure that a copy of a QR code for the workplace is displayed in a prominent place at or near the main entrance of the workplace. However, subclause (1)— does not apply if the workplace is a vehicle; and applies to the workplace of a business or service that is in a dwelling house only if— customers or clients of the business or service customarily enter the dwelling house; or workers of the business or service customarily enter the dwelling house (and those workers are not residents of the dwelling house or providing a category A social service). A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person in control of a public transport service must ensure that a copy of a QR code is displayed in a prominent place on or inside any vehicle that is in use as part of that service. However, subclause (1) does not apply in relation to a public transport service if all persons using the service are required to supply their contact details in order to use the service. In subclause (1), public transport service excludes a school transport service. In subclause (2), contact details means— the name of the person; and a telephone number that may be used to easily contact the person. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Every person must wear a face covering while on board a vehicle that is in use as part of a public transport service. However, subclause (1) does not apply— to a person who is a passenger on a small passenger service vehicle; or to a ferry service carrying passengers between the North Island and the South Island; or to air transport; or to a school transport service; or in the circumstances set out in clause 13. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Every person must wear a face covering while on board a vehicle that is in use as part of a domestic air transport service. However, subclause (1) does not apply in the circumstances set out in clause 13. In this clause, domestic air transport service means a public transport service that is transporting persons by air transport between places that are both in New Zealand. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Clauses 11(1) and 12(1) do not apply if— there is an emergency; or wearing a face covering is not safe in all of the circumstances; or the person is in a defined space or an enclosed space that is separate from the passenger area; or the person is communicating with a person who is deaf or hard of hearing and visibility of the mouth is essential for communication; or the person is asked to remove the face covering to ascertain identity; or removal of, or not wearing, the face covering is otherwise required or authorised by law; or the person is under the age of 12 years; or the person has a physical or mental illness or condition or disability that makes wearing a face covering unsuitable; or the person needs to remove the face covering to take medicine; or the person needs to remove the face covering to eat or drink (if eating or drinking is permitted by the conditions of carriage on the relevant service). In addition to the requirement in clause 9(1), a person in control of a workplace must have other record-keeping systems and processes in place to enable a contact tracing record to be kept of,— in the case of a specified workplace, all workers of that workplace entering the workplace: in the case of any other workplace, all persons entering that workplace. Subclause (1) does not apply if the workplace is excluded from the application of clause 9(1). For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(a), specified workplace means— a transport station; or a supermarket; or a petrol station, including any business operating out of the petrol station. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In relation to how the contact tracing record under subclause (1) is collected, kept, and used, see the requirements in the Privacy Act 2020 that apply to persons collecting personal information. In this order, the 1-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 1 metre away from any other person; but applies only if the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) applies to each person referred to in paragraph (a) (for example, if both persons are workers); and does not apply to— a person in relation to their fellow residents; or a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace. In this order, the 2-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 2 metres away from any other person; but does not apply to— a person in relation to their fellow residents; or a gathering of friends and whānau in a workplace. Clauses 17 to 25 apply to workplaces of businesses and services, but do not apply to— voluntary or not-for-profit sporting, recreational, social, or cultural activities; or community club activities (except activities that occur at the same time and place as services provided under a club licence under section 21 of the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012); or faith-based gatherings; or households carrying out family activities involving only fellow residents; or a gathering held at a facility or venue of a business or service that has been hired for the gathering if the gathering is not for the purpose of the business or service. See clauses 27 to 31, which contain requirements relating to social gatherings (including those described in subclause (1)﻿(a) to (e)). However, nothing in this Part applies to a school transport service. A business or service must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all workers in a workplace of, or while working for, the business or service; and maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 2-metre physical distancing rule for any other persons entering a workplace, or using the services, of the business or service; and mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained (for example, through regular cleaning of surfaces or the installation of plastic barriers). Subclause (1)﻿(a) and (b) applies except to the extent adjusted by clauses 19 to 25. All workers of a business or service in the workplace of, or while working for, the business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. All other persons who enter a workplace of, or use the services of, a business or service must comply with the 2-metre physical distancing rule so far as is reasonably practicable. Subclauses (1) and (2) apply except to the extent adjusted by clauses 19 to 25. A breach of subclause (1) or (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for category A businesses and services. Category A businesses and services must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a category A business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for education entities. Education entities— need not have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for people who are ordinarily at the education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services; but must have systems and processes in place to mitigate so far as is reasonably practicable the risks that arise to the extent that compliance with the physical distancing requirements that would otherwise apply under this Part to the workplace or service is not fully maintained (for example, regular cleaning of surfaces). People who are ordinarily at an education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services are not required to comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule. The adjustment in subclause (2) and the exemption from physical distancing in subclause (3) do not apply to— inter-school activities; or activities at (or connected with) an education entity that are attended by people who are otherwise not ordinarily at that education entity for the purposes of receiving or providing, or assisting in or supporting the receipt or provision of, education services. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for public transport services. Public transport services need not have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a public transport service are not required to comply with either the 1-metre physical distancing rule or the 2-metre physical distancing rule. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for transport stations. Transport stations must have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a transport station must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (3) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for controlled-access businesses and services. In this clause, controlled-access businesses and services— means the following businesses and services: businesses and services to the extent that they largely have a consistent group of workers and usually have a fixed workplace, such as office workplaces and factories; and businesses and services to the extent that their customers or clients are members of the business or service, such as gyms; and public facilities that are located within a building or structure, such as swimming pools, libraries, and museums; and event facilities such as cinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, and casinos; but excludes retail businesses, such as shopping malls, supermarkets, marketplaces, takeaway-food stores, and retail stores. Controlled-access businesses and services must have systems and processes in place to— maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service; and if they are an event facility, permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the facility at any 1 time (not including workers). All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a controlled-access business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (4) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the alert level 2 requirements for businesses or services to the extent that customers or clients enter their workplaces and food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) to those customers or clients in the workplace, such as— a restaurant or cafe; or a soup kitchen or other place where food or drink is provided without charge. Businesses and services must, in relation to that activity, have systems and processes in place to,— in on-licence premises or club premises, ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing: in other premises, ensure that each customer or client is seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food or drink. All persons who are customers or clients in an on-licence premises or club premises must be seated at a table other than when entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing. All persons who are customers or clients of any other business or service in which food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) must be seated at a table other than when— entering, using a toilet or bathroom, paying, or departing; or ordering or collecting food or drink. Businesses and services must also, in relation to the activity described in subclause (1), have systems and processes in place to— permit no more than 100 customers or clients to be in any 1 defined space in the workplace at any 1 time; and ensure that the number of customers or clients seated at a table together does not exceed the maximum number limit (if any) for social gatherings; and ensure that there is at least a 1-metre separation between adjacent tables where customers or clients are seated; and ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that only 1 worker serves at any table; and so far as is reasonably practicable, maintain compliance with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all customers and clients when they are not seated at a table. All persons who are customers or clients at a business or service in which food or drink is sold or provided for consumption (or offered for consumption) must— be seated at a table together in a number that does not exceed the maximum number limit (if any) for social gatherings: comply so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) when they are not seated at a table. Nothing in this clause applies to— accommodation services selling or providing food or drink for residents (including room service): businesses or services providing food or drink to their workers: vending machines that are located and used within a workplace. A breach of subclause (3), (4), or (6) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. This clause adjusts the physical distancing requirements for close-proximity businesses and services. In this clause, close-proximity businesses and services means businesses and services to the extent that they carry on activities that they cannot undertake without physical contact, or close proximity, between people (for example, massage and hairdressing services or professional or semi-professional sports). Close-proximity businesses and services must, in relation to that activity, have systems and processes in place to maintain compliance so far as is reasonably practicable with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) for all persons entering the workplace of, using the services of, or working for the business or service. However, subclause (3) does not apply to the extent that workers are required to have physical contact with, or close proximity to, people in order to carry out the activities of that business or service. All persons who enter the workplace of, use the services of, or work for a close-proximity business or service must comply with the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) so far as is reasonably practicable. However, neither subclause (5) nor the 2-metre physical distancing rule applies to the extent that physical contact, or close proximity, is required between workers and other people in order to carry out the activities of a close-proximity business or service. A breach of subclause (5) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Clauses 27 to 31 do not apply to a gathering of fellow residents. A social gathering must not exceed 100 people in a defined space at any one time. This clause does not apply to any premises referred to in section 12(2)﻿(d) of the Act. Workers who are providing services in relation to a social gathering are not to be counted as part of the number limit for the gathering in clause 27. A person must not attend a social gathering that exceeds the number limit for that gathering specified in clause 27. If clause 31(2) applies to a social gathering, a person who attends the social gathering must— scan the QR code for the social gathering; or provide details in the contact tracing record referred to in that clause. A social gathering that exceeds the number limit for the gathering in clause 27 is prohibited. The people responsible for a social gathering must ensure that the social gathering does not exceed the number limit. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A social gathering in which the requirements in subclause (2) are not met is prohibited. The people responsible for a social gathering must ensure that there are systems and processes in place to ensure that, so far as is reasonably practicable, each person who attends the social gathering— scans the QR code for the social gathering; or provides details in a contact tracing record that is kept by one of the people responsible for or attending the social gathering. Subclause (2) does not apply if every person at the social gathering knows, and can identify for the purposes of contact tracing, every other person who is a participant in the social gathering. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In relation to how the contact tracing record under subclause (2) is collected, kept, and used, see the requirements in the Privacy Act 2020 that apply to persons collecting personal information. Nothing in this order prevents any person from assisting in, or responding to, an emergency. Nothing in this order applies— to border services (including law enforcement activities related to border services) provided by Immigration New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service, Maritime New Zealand, or the Ministry for Primary Industries: to the provision of health services: to residential centres (including care and protection and youth justice residences), family homes, and group homes (including family group homes and community-based remand centres) that are approved or recognised for the time being by the chief executive of Oranga Tamariki as a place of care or treatment for the purposes of the Oranga Tamariki Act 1989: within a corrections prison as defined in section 3(1) of the Corrections Act 2004 or any premises managed by or on behalf of the Department of Corrections: to custodial or detention services managed by the New Zealand Police, the Department of Corrections, or the Ministry of Justice, or within a courthouse: to the administration of sentences and orders by the Department of Corrections or on its behalf: to people being transported for the purposes of the Department of Corrections and New Zealand Police fulfilling their purposes and performing their functions and duties: to the New Zealand Parole Board: to the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service: to the Government Communications Security Bureau: to the New Zealand Defence Force: to the New Zealand Police: to Fire and Emergency New Zealand: to civil defence emergency management services provided by the National Emergency Management Agency and Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups: to managed isolation or quarantine services for COVID-19 or to people while they are required to be in isolation or quarantine in accordance with either of the following: the Isolation and Quarantine Order: the Maritime Border Order: to workers carrying out any business or service referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (o): to people who are enforcement officers carrying out their functions and exercising their powers under the Act. The Director-General may exempt any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods (or any person, business, service, or goods) from the application of any provision of this order or from the requirement to comply with any provision of this order in accordance with this clause. The Director-General may grant an exemption if satisfied that— the exemption is necessary or desirable in order to promote the purposes of the Act or the purposes of this order; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemption. The Director-General may impose conditions on the exemption as the Director-General considers necessary. An exemption for any specified person, business, service, or goods must be notified in writing to— the applicant; and in the case of an exemption for any specified person, business, or service, the exempt person or business. An exemption for any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods must— be published on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government; and be notified in the Gazette. The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 4) 2021 (LI 2021/31) is revoked. In this Part, commencement means the date on and time at which this order commences. This clause applies if, on commencement,— people who are not fellow residents of each other are residing in the same room of an accommodation service; and the number of those people is more than 10 (which is the maximum number of people who may form an accommodation service bubble arrangement); and the room is not large enough to enable compliance with the physical distancing requirements while those people are in the room. The physical distancing requirements do not apply to the extent needed to allow those people to continue residing in that room of the accommodation service. In this clause, physical distancing requirements means the requirements that are described in clauses 17 and 18 and apply to those people while they are in the accommodation service. An exemption granted by the Director-General under clause 46 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 4) 2021 that is in force immediately before commencement continues in force on and after commencement as if it had been granted under clause 34 of this order, and is subject to the same conditions (if any) as applied before commencement. Alert level 2 area means— the area within the boundaries of Auckland as determined by the Local Government (Auckland Boundaries) Determination 2010 (Gazette 2010, p 858); and the area (bounded by the middle of the roads listed below)— commencing on the mean high-water mark of the west coast of the North Island at the southernmost point of the south-west corner of the area described in paragraph (a) (the boundaries of Auckland); then proceeding in a generally south-easterly direction along the mean high-water mark (and across the mouth of the Waikato River) to the Kaawa Stream; then proceeding in a generally north-easterly direction along the north bank of the Kaawa Stream to the intersection with Port Waikato-Waikaretu Road; then proceeding south along Port Waikato-Waikaretu Road to the intersection with Baker Road; then proceeding east along Baker Road to the intersection with Wairamarama-Onewhero Road; then proceeding south along Wairamarama-Onewhero Road to the intersection with Bothwell Loop Road; then proceeding east along Bothwell Loop Road to the intersection with Waikaretu Valley Road; then proceeding east along Waikaretu Valley Road to the intersection with State Highway 22; then proceeding north-east along State Highway 22 to the intersection with Glen Murray Road; then proceeding south-east along Glen Murray Road to the intersection with Churchill Road; then proceeding north along Churchill Road until it crosses Opuatia Stream; then proceeding in a generally north-easterly direction along the north bank of the Opuatia Stream to the Waikato River; then proceeding in a generally northerly direction along the west bank of the Waikato River to the intersection with Mercer Ferry Road; then proceeding north-east along Mercer Ferry Road to the intersection with Koheroa Road; then proceeding north-east along Koheroa Road to the intersection with Mangatawhiri Road; then proceeding north-west along Mangatawhiri Road to the intersection with Lyons Road; then proceeding north-east along Lyons Road to the intersection with Paparimu Road; then proceeding north-west along Paparimu Road to the intersection with the area described in paragraph (a) (the boundaries of Auckland); then proceeding in a generally westerly direction along the southern boundary of the boundaries of Auckland to the point of commencement described in subparagraph (i). This order replaces the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 4) 2021. It moves Auckland from alert level 3 to alert level 2, and the rest of the country from alert level 2 to alert level 1. The requirement to wear face coverings on public transport services and domestic air transport services continues to apply throughout the country. This order comes into force at 6 am on 7 March 2021. Part 1 of this order sets out the purpose of this order (see clause 3) and definitions used in the order (see clause 4).

For the purpose of the definition of defined space in subclause (1),—  an indoor space or outdoor space is a single space if there are walls (whether permanent or temporary) that substantially divide that space from other spaces: an outdoor space is also a single space if there is at least 2 metres between all people in that space and any other people (outside that space). In this order, electoral premises means— polling places; and advance voting places; and national, regional, and electorate premises of the Electoral Commission; and premises, or any defined space in any premises, used by the Electoral Commission for training electoral workers. However, the premises listed in subclause (1) are only electoral premises for the purposes of this order while they are being used by the Electoral Commission. The transitional, savings, and related provisions (if any) set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. This order applies to the whole of New Zealand. This order adjusts rules and permissions in other COVID-19 orders, in relation to the 2020 general election and referendums. This order applies in relation to another COVID-19 order regardless of whether the other COVID-19 order— is in force when this order is made; or  is made, or comes into force, after this order is made. Subclause (1) is only a guide to the general scheme and effect of this order. This order is revoked on the close of the day on which the writ for the 2020 general election is returned by the Electoral Commission. In all electoral premises, the Electoral Commission must ensure that a copy of a QR code for the premises is displayed in a prominent place at or near the main entrance of the premises. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. If a corresponding requirement under another COVID-19 order would have applied to any electoral premises, this clause applies in the place of that requirement to the electoral premises. This clause applies if another COVID-19 order imposes a contact tracing requirement (other than the display of a QR code) that applies generally to 1 or more types of premises throughout, or in 1 or more areas of, New Zealand. In addition to the requirement in clause 10(1), the Electoral Commission must have record-keeping systems and processes in place to enable a contact tracing record to be kept of all persons entering electoral premises in the area or areas of New Zealand in which that contact tracing requirement generally applies. A breach of subclause (2) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In this clause, contact tracing record, in relation to a person entering any electoral premises, means— the name of the person; and the date on which and approximate time at which the person entered the premises; and a telephone number that may be used to easily contact the person. To the extent that the contact tracing requirement under the other COVID-19 order would have applied to the electoral premises, this clause applies in the place of that requirement to the electoral premises. In relation to how the contact tracing record under subclause (2) is collected, kept, and used, see the requirements in the Privacy Act 1993 that apply to persons collecting personal information. This subpart applies if another COVID-19 order imposes physical distancing requirements that apply generally to 1 or more types of workplaces throughout, or in 1 or more areas of, New Zealand. If this subpart applies,— it applies in relation to electoral premises in the area or areas of New Zealand in which those physical distancing requirements generally apply; and it applies in place of any of those requirements that would otherwise have applied in relation to those electoral premises. In this order, the 1-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 1 metre away from any other person; but applies only if the 1-metre physical distancing rule (rather than the 2-metre physical distancing rule) applies to each person referred to in paragraph (a); and does not apply to a person in relation to their fellow residents; and (except in an area that is subject to stay-at-home requirements under another COVID-19 order) does not apply to a gathering of friends and whānau. In this order, the 2-metre physical distancing rule— requires that a person remain at least 2 metres away from any other person; but for persons who are in queues to enter polling places or advance voting places, who are entering or exiting those premises, or who are electoral workers working directly outside those premises, requires that the person remain at least 2 metres away from any other person described in this paragraph; and does not apply to a person in relation to their fellow residents; and (except in an area that is subject to stay-at-home requirements under another COVID-19 order) does not apply to a gathering of friends and whānau. The Electoral Commission must have systems and processes in place— to maintain compliance (to the greatest extent practicable) with the physical distancing rules that apply to persons in relation to a polling place, or an advance voting place,— while those premises are open to the public for voting purposes (see clause 16); and at the additional times described in clause 16(2); and to maintain compliance (to the greatest extent practicable) with the 1-metre physical distancing rule that applies to all of the following persons in electoral premises (other than in a polling place or an advance voting place at the times described in paragraph (a)): electoral workers; and scrutineers; and Justices of the Peace and Judges carrying out electoral activities in accordance with the Electoral Act 1993 and the Electoral Regulations 1996; and persons assisting Judges for the purpose in subparagraph (iii); and to maintain compliance (to the greatest extent practicable) with the 2-metre physical distancing rule that applies to any other persons in electoral premises (other than in a polling place or an advance voting place at the times described in paragraph (a)); and to mitigate the risks that arise to the extent that physical distancing is not fully maintained (for example, through regular cleaning of surfaces and availability of hand sanitiser). A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. If either of the following rules applies to a person, the person must comply with that rule to the greatest extent practicable: the 1-metre physical distancing rule: the 2-metre physical distancing rule. A breach of subclause (1) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. When a polling place or an advance voting place is open to the public for voting purposes, the physical distancing requirements are as follows: the 1-metre physical distancing rule applies to all persons in the polling place or the advance voting place (unless subclause (4) applies to those premises at that time); and the 2-metre physical distancing rule applies (to the greatest extent practicable) to— all persons who are in a queue to enter the polling place or the advance voting place; and all persons who are entering or leaving those premises; and all persons who are electoral workers working directly outside those premises (for example, supervising the queue). The physical distancing requirements in subclause (1) also apply, as follows, at the following additional times: the requirements in subclause (1)﻿(b) apply to all persons described in that paragraph at any time when, before a polling place or an advance voting place opens to the public for voting purposes on a day, there is a queue to enter those premises; and the requirements in subclause (1)﻿(a) and (b) apply to all persons described in that subclause at any time until, after a polling place or an advance voting place has closed to the public for voting purposes on a day, all of the public has exited those premises. Subclause (4) applies if a polling place, or an advance voting place, is in an area that is subject to stay-at-home requirements under another COVID-19 order. The physical distancing requirements relating to the polling place or the advance voting place at the times described in subclauses (1) and (2) are the same as in those subclauses, except that the 2-metre physical distancing rule applies to all persons in the polling place or the advance voting place. In this subpart,— clause 18 applies to a person to the extent that a stay-at-home requirement under another COVID-19 order would otherwise prevent the person from leaving their home or place of residence to travel as described in that clause; and clause 19 applies if another COVID-19 order restricts travel from, or to, an area of New Zealand (a bounded area). To the extent that the stay-at-home requirements or the travel restrictions are inconsistent with this subpart, this subpart prevails. Anything done in accordance with this subpart is not a breach of the other COVID-19 order. If this clause applies to a person, subject to clause 19 (if it applies), the person is permitted to do any of the following: leave their home or place of residence— to enrol to vote in the 2020 general election and referendums (enrol to vote): to vote in the 2020 general election or 1 or both of the referendums (vote): leave their home or place of residence to, at the request of another person, accompany that person to a place where that person can enrol to vote or vote: leave their home or place of residence to enable or assist another person, in accordance with the Electoral Act 1993 and the Electoral Regulations 1996 (for example, as that person’s representative as defined in that Act, or under section 170 of that Act), to enrol to vote or to vote: if the person is a dependant of any person (person A) who is travelling for any purpose described in paragraph (a) to (c), leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of accompanying person A: if the person is an electoral worker, leave their home or place of residence to carry out any activity associated with that role: if the person is a scrutineer, Justice of the Peace, or Judge, leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of carrying out electoral activities in accordance with the Electoral Act 1993 and the Electoral Regulations 1996: if the person is assisting a Judge for the purpose described in paragraph (f), leave their home or place of residence to provide that assistance. However, see clause 19 if another COVID-19 order restricts travel from, or to, an area of New Zealand. The permissions in clause 18(1)﻿(a) to (d) do not extend to permitting a person to go into, or out of, a bounded area. A person described in clause 18(1)﻿(e), (f), or (g) is permitted, for the purpose described in that paragraph, to go into, or out of, a bounded area, but— only if the person, while in the bounded area,— to the greatest extent practicable, travels directly without stopping (except for a permitted airport transfer); and if temporary accommodation is necessary, stays in no more than 1 place; and the person may go into, through, and out of the bounded area in 1 trip only if— neither the place of departure nor the destination is in the bounded area; and it is necessary to travel through the bounded area for the purpose of their travel; and the person carries evidence of the purpose of their travel and the location of the place of departure and destination. Subclause (2) applies— only to the extent that the travel would otherwise be restricted by a COVID-19 order: regardless of whether clause 18 applies. In this clause, bounded area has the meaning set out in clause 17(1)﻿(b). For the purposes of subclause (2), permitted airport transfer means a stop by a person at an airport for the purpose of transferring to an aircraft to go to another place in New Zealand if— the person does not leave the airport except to board a departing flight or to stay in temporary accommodation; and the person’s departing flight is scheduled to depart within 4 hours after the person enters the airport. This clause does not limit a person travelling for a purpose described in clause 18 in accordance with any more permissive COVID-19 order. This clause applies— to the extent that the Electoral Commission has entered into a lease of premises, or a defined space in premises, for use as electoral premises; and if another COVID-19 order requires a person to close those premises or that defined space, or to close other premises reasonably necessary to access those premises or that defined space. The premises or defined space may open for use as electoral premises. Any premises reasonably necessary to access the electoral premises may open for the purpose of enabling that access. In this clause, lease includes a licence or a contract to enter into a lease or licence. Anything done in accordance with this clause is not a breach of the other COVID-19 order. For the purposes of any other COVID-19 order, the following do not amount to a social gathering: accessing or providing electoral services in accordance with this order: persons described in clause 18(1)﻿(f) carrying out activities described in that paragraph in accordance with this order. Nothing in this order prevents any person from assisting in, or responding to, an emergency. Nothing in this order applies— to people while they are required to be in isolation or quarantine in accordance with either of the following: the Isolation and Quarantine Order: the Maritime Border Order: within a corrections prison as defined in section 3(1) of the Corrections Act 2004 or any premises managed by or on behalf of the Department of Corrections: to the New Zealand Police: to Fire and Emergency New Zealand: to civil defence emergency management services provided by the National Emergency Management Agency and Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups: to workers carrying out any business or service referred to in any of paragraphs (b) to (e): to people who are enforcement officers carrying out their functions and exercising their powers under the Act. In this clause,— Isolation and Quarantine Order means the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Isolation and Quarantine) Order 2020 Maritime Border Order means the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order (No 2) 2020 worker means, in relation to a business or service, any person who carries out work in any capacity for that business or service (whether paid or unpaid). The Director-General may exempt any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods (or person, business, or service) from the application of any provision of this order or from the requirement to comply with any provision of this order if the Director-General is satisfied that— the exemption is necessary or desirable in order to promote the purposes of the Act or the purposes of this order; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemption. The Director-General may impose conditions on the exemption as the Director-General considers necessary. An exemption for any specified person, business, service, or goods must be notified in writing to— the applicant; and in the case of an exemption for any specified person, business, or service, the exempt person or business. An exemption for any class of persons, businesses, services, or goods must— be published on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government; and be notified in the Gazette. There are no transitional, savings, or related provisions relating to this order as made. This order, which comes into force at 11.59 pm on 2 October 2020, is made under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 (the Act). The order relates to the safe conduct of the 2020 general election and referendums, and enhancing public confidence to vote, in the context of COVID-19. Part 2 contains a rule requiring the display of QR codes in electoral premises, which includes polling places and advance voting places. The rule applies while the order is in force, regardless of what alert level New Zealand, or areas of New Zealand, are at in relation to COVID-19. Part 3 contains other rules and permissions. Whether these rules and permissions apply (and the areas to which they apply) will depend on what general alert level requirements apply throughout, or in areas of, New Zealand from time to time while this order is in force. In Part 3, broadly,— subpart 1 relates to contact tracing requirements in electoral premises (additional to the display of a QR code): subpart 2 imposes physical distancing requirements for electoral premises and for queues to enter polling places and advance voting places. This subpart will apply in any area of New Zealand where physical distancing requirements are imposed generally on 1 or more types of workplaces under another COVID-19 order: subpart 3 relates to travel. Clause 18, which applies to a person if another COVID-19 order imposes stay-at-home requirements that apply to that person, defines essential personal travel in the context of the election and referendums. This includes travelling to vote or to accompany another person to a place where that person can vote, travel for electoral workers, and travel for persons involved in the integrity of the electoral system (such as scrutineers). Clause 19 contains qualifications to this travel that relate to, or prevent, the crossing of any boundaries imposed by another COVID-19 order (but without limiting travel allowed by another COVID-19 order): subpart 4 allows premises that must be closed under another COVID-19 order to open for use as electoral premises or to enable access to electoral premises: subpart 5 clarifies that accessing and providing electoral services (such as voting) or services related to the integrity of the electoral system (such as scrutineers observing voting) in accordance with the order will not amount to a social gathering under another COVID-19 order. This order applies in relation to other COVID-19 orders regardless of whether those other orders come into force before this order is made, or are made or come into force after this order is made. However, under the Act, the Minister of Health may amend this order and must keep this order under review.

The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in Schedule 1 have effect according to their terms. This order applies to the whole of New Zealand. This Part applies to a person who is required by or under a COVID-19 order or another enactment to be isolated or quarantined in accordance with this order (a relevant person). However, this Part applies to a relevant worker only to the extent provided in clauses 15DA and 15DB. A relevant person must be isolated or quarantined as required by this clause throughout their period of isolation or quarantine. They must remain in their room at their place of isolation or quarantine, except as permitted by clause 13 or 14. They must maintain physical distancing (to the greatest extent practicable) from every person in or outside their place of isolation or quarantine,— including others isolated or quarantined at the same place; but not including their fellow residents (if any). They must wear personal protective equipment as directed by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer. A relevant person must report for, and undergo, medical examination and testing for COVID-19 at any time throughout their period of isolation or quarantine, as directed by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer. A person’s period of isolation or quarantine is— the period ending at the same time of day as, but on the 14th day after, their start time if the chief executive of MBIE is satisfied that the person meets the low-risk indicators, as determined— as close as is reasonably practicable to the end of that period; and based on the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner; or any longer period needed to satisfy the chief executive of MBIE, based on the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner, that the person meets the low-risk indicators, but no longer than the period ending at the same time of day as, but on the 28th day after, their start time. A person’s start time is— the time and date of the person’s arrival in New Zealand (for example, 3.30 pm on 15 September 2020), unless paragraph (b) applies; or the start time that applies to the person under the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order (No 2) 2020. However, if another person is designated as their fellow resident, and the fellow resident’s start time under subclause (2) is a later start time, the person’s start time becomes that later start time. See clause 15(2)﻿(c) in relation to the start time of caregivers. This clause is subject to clause 11, which provides for an early end to the period of isolation or quarantine for certain people. This clause provides for certain people’s period of isolation or quarantine to end earlier than provided in clause 10(1). If a person is isolated or quarantined at an MIQF, the site manager may end their period of isolation or quarantine no more than 3 hours before it would otherwise end under clause 10(1) if satisfied that— it is a practical time for the person to leave the MIQF; and the person meets the low-risk indicators, based on the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner. Subclause (4) applies to a person who is scheduled to depart from New Zealand during the period under clause 10(1) (a scheduled departer), other than— an aircrew member; or a person who assisted, or is to assist, as a medical attendant as described by subclause (4A)﻿(b). Their period of isolation or quarantine ends 12 hours before their scheduled departure as long as— they— have been in New Zealand for less than 72 hours; or have been in New Zealand for 72 hours or more and the chief executive of MBIE is satisfied, based on the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner, that they meet the low-risk indicators; and they leave their place of isolation or quarantine only to travel to the place of departure and depart accordingly. Subclause (4B) applies to a scheduled departer who is not ordinarily resident in New Zealand and who— is an aircrew member; or arrived in New Zealand by air— while assisting, as a medical attendant, with a medical air transfer to New Zealand; or to assist, as a medical attendant, with a medical air transfer from New Zealand. Their period of isolation or quarantine ends 12 hours before their scheduled departure from New Zealand, as long as they leave their place of isolation or quarantine only to travel to the place of departure and depart accordingly. A scheduled departer whose period of isolation or quarantine ends under subclause (4) or (4B) must comply with any directions of the chief executive of MBIE (given on the advice of a medical officer of health or a health protection officer) relating to the travel of the scheduled departer to the place of departure. See also the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order (No 2) 2020, which provides for an early end to the period of isolation or quarantine for certain people. A person’s place of isolation or quarantine means the high-risk MIQF or low-risk MIQF that is allocated to the person— by the chief executive of MBIE; and after a suitably qualified health practitioner determines, in accordance with any guidelines provided by the Director-General, whether the person should be allocated a high-risk MIQF or low-risk MIQF. However, a medical officer of health may instead determine for any reason (for example, for medical evacuation) that a person’s place of isolation or quarantine is any other facility or place. In determining that a person’s place of isolation or quarantine is any other facility or place under subclause (2), the medical officer of health must consider— relevant individual and operational implications; and whether the other facility or place is able to meet the person’s particular physical or other needs. A medical officer of health need not consider making a determination under subclause (2) for a person if the chief executive of MBIE— consults, and considers the advice of, a suitably qualified health practitioner or of a person who is registered or licensed as an equivalent health professional overseas; and determines that the person does not have particular physical or other needs that require another type of facility or place. A person is permitted to leave their room at their place of isolation or quarantine— to do any activity (for example, exercise) of a type, and in accordance with any conditions, authorised by the chief executive of MBIE; or to visit the room of a fellow resident; or if they need to leave to preserve or protect their own or another person’s life, health, or safety in an emergency; or to attend any court, tribunal, New Zealand Parole Board hearing, or other judicial institution that they are required or permitted to attend by that institution; or if the chief executive of MBIE is satisfied, based on the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner, that the person needs to leave— to access medical services; or to move to another place of isolation or quarantine (for example, for temporary or emergency care while the person is sick); or if they are required to leave under Part 4 of the Health Act 1956; or if they are required to move to another place of isolation or quarantine by— a court order; or any other obligation imposed by or under an enactment that is related to the detention of the person (for example, a direction of the New Zealand Parole Board or a probation officer). However, a person leaving their place of isolation or quarantine under this clause must comply with any directions of, or conditions imposed by, the chief executive of MBIE. A person is also permitted to leave their room at their place of isolation or quarantine— to assist or accompany a fellow resident to travel somewhere under any provision in clause 13(b) to (f); or for any exceptional reason. However, the person may leave only— if authorised by the chief executive of MBIE; and in accordance with the conditions (if any) imposed by the chief executive of MBIE. The chief executive of MBIE must not authorise a person to leave under this clause unless— the risk assessment tool indicates that the person’s leaving would not create a high risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19; and if paragraph (a) is satisfied, the chief executive— consults a medical officer of health, and takes into account their advice, about— the effect that the person’s leaving might have on the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19; and any conditions required to minimise that risk; and is satisfied, based on the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner, that the person meets the low-risk indicators; and is satisfied that the person will comply with any conditions of the authorisation. In this clause, risk assessment tool means a risk matrix that— is approved by the Director-General, including as updated at any time; and assesses the risk of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 by taking into account matters such as the following: the risk caused by any activity for which the person seeks to leave their place of isolation or quarantine: the results of any medical examination and testing of the person or any other relevant person: the length of time for which the person has been isolated or quarantined: the risk profile of the country or countries from which the person arrived: any international airports or ports to which the person has been on the way to New Zealand: any potential exposure of the person to COVID-19 before arriving in New Zealand (for example, from working in healthcare or being somewhere without controls on community transmission): the length of time for which the person will leave their place of isolation or quarantine. The site manager of an MIQF may designate a relevant person as the fellow resident of another relevant person if— they were fellow travellers when they arrived in New Zealand; or  the site manager is satisfied that the designation would be appropriate for the purposes of keeping connections with family or whānau or enabling caregiving or support. In this clause, fellow traveller, of any person arriving in New Zealand, means,— if the person is an aircrew member, an aircrew member arriving in New Zealand on the same aircraft; or in any other case, anyone who accompanied the person on the journey to New Zealand. A caregiver of a vulnerable person may join them at their place of isolation or quarantine, to care for them, if authorised by the chief executive of MBIE. A caregiver who joins a vulnerable person in accordance with the authorisation— is to be treated as being a relevant person, and a fellow resident of the vulnerable person, for the purposes of this Part; and  has the following start time for the purposes of clause 10: the same start time as the vulnerable person, but only if the chief executive of MBIE is satisfied, based on the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner, that the caregiver meets the low-risk indicators when joining the vulnerable person; or the time and date of their joining the vulnerable person, otherwise. This clause does not apply to a caregiver if they are a relevant person independently of this clause. In this clause, vulnerable person includes— a child, meaning a person who is younger than 18 years of age; and a person who is elderly or has a disability. The Minister may exempt any class of relevant persons from the requirement to comply with any provision of this Part or the application of any provision of this Part if the Minister is satisfied that— the exemption (together with any conditions) is not inconsistent with the purpose of the Act; and the exemption is necessary to facilitate a Government-approved event, or a major Government-approved programme, within the meaning of the relevant immigration instructions; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to facilitate that event or programme. The Minister may impose conditions on the exemption as the Minister considers necessary. The Minister must take into account the advice of the Director-General when deciding— whether to grant an exemption; and what (if any) conditions to impose on an exemption. An exemption must— be published on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government; and be notified in the Gazette. In this clause, relevant immigration instructions means the immigration instructions (as in force from time to time) that— are certified under section 22 of the Immigration Act 2009; and relate to the grant of temporary entry class visas. This Part applies to a person (a relevant worker) who— is required by the Air Border Order to be isolated or quarantined in accordance with this order; and is ordinarily resident in New Zealand; and is any of the following: a relevant crew member: a relevant medical attendant: a Police escort. However, this Part does not apply to the extent provided in clauses 15DA and 15DB. In this Part,— Air Border Order means the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) 2020 Police escort means a Police escort to whom clause 18 of the Air Border Order applies (duties in connection with extradition to or deportation from New Zealand) relevant crew member means an aircrew member who— travelled on a higher-risk route (within the meaning of the Air Border Order) within the 7 days immediately before their arrival by air in New Zealand  relevant medical attendant means a person who, on arrival by air in New Zealand,— was assisting, as a medical attendant, with a medical air transfer to New Zealand; or was returning from assisting, as a medical attendant, with a medical air transfer from New Zealand. Before departing from the security designated aerodrome at which they arrive in New Zealand, a relevant worker must notify the Ministry of Health, in the manner approved by the Director-General, of— the address of the residence or other accommodation that they intend to be their place of self-isolation; and an email address and telephone number at which they may be contacted. In this clause, security designated aerodrome has the meaning given by section 2(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 1990. A relevant worker must comply with the requirements set out in this clause throughout their period of self-isolation. They must remain at the accommodation notified to the Ministry of Health as their place of self-isolation, except as permitted by this Part. They must maintain physical distancing (to the greatest extent practicable) from every person in or outside their place of self-isolation. They must not permit any other person to enter their accommodation unless— the place is a residence at which the other person lives; or the entry is for the purposes of preserving or protecting the relevant worker’s or another person’s life, health, or safety in an emergency. They must wear personal protective equipment at all times (to the greatest extent practicable) when outside their place of self-isolation. A relevant worker who is determined to have had a high risk of exposure to COVID-19 during their most recent absence from New Zealand is, on their arrival in New Zealand by air, subject to Part 1 (isolation and quarantine) rather than this Part. A relevant worker is determined to have had a high risk of exposure to COVID-19 during their most recent absence from New Zealand if— a medical officer of health has assessed that there is a high risk that, during that absence, the worker has been exposed to COVID-19; and that assessment was made by the medical officer of health no earlier than 7 days before the relevant worker’s arrival by air in New Zealand. A relevant crew member is subject to Part 1 rather than this Part if they— were outside New Zealand (other than in a QFT place) for a continuous period of at least 7 days immediately before arriving in New Zealand by air; or have travelled domestically outside New Zealand (other than in a QFT place) within the 7 days immediately before that arrival (see clause 24 of the Air Border Order). A relevant crew member travels domestically outside New Zealand if— they travel by aircraft on a domestic route in a country outside New Zealand; and there are other persons travelling on the aircraft who are not— the pilot or a co-pilot of the aircraft; or a person who works as a pilot, co-pilot, or flight attendant for the same airline as the aircrew member. A relevant worker is subject to Part 1 (isolation and quarantine) rather than this Part if a suitably qualified health practitioner responsible for the medical examination and testing of the worker under clause 8(2) of the Air Border Order is not satisfied that the worker is at a low risk of having or transmitting COVID-19 (see clause 21 of the Air Border Order). A relevant worker is subject to Part 1 rather than this Part if a medical officer of health determines (on the basis of information brought to that officer’s attention) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that, within the 7 days immediately before arriving in New Zealand by air and while anywhere outside New Zealand except for a QFT place, the worker has failed to meet 1 or more of the relevant key safety standards (see clause 25 of the Air Border Order). In this clause, QFT place has the meaning given by the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order (No 2) 2020, and includes an aircraft undertaking a QFT flight (within the meaning of that order). The key safety standards, for a relevant crew member, a relevant medical attendant, or a Police escort, are set out in the relevant part of Schedule 2. A relevant worker’s period of self-isolation is the period— commencing as soon as practicable after they arrive in New Zealand; and ending when they receive a negative result from the medical examination and testing they are required to undergo by this Part (but ending no later than 14 days after the time and date of their arrival in New Zealand). A relevant worker must report for, and undergo, medical examination and testing for COVID-19 after at least 48 hours have passed since the time and date of their arrival in New Zealand. That medical examination and testing must involve taking nose swabs or mouth swabs (or both). A relevant worker is permitted to leave the accommodation notified to the Ministry of Health as their place of self-isolation— to report for, and undergo, medical examination required by this Part; or to do any outdoor exercise (except at any shared exercise facility, such as a swimming pool); or if they need to leave to preserve or protect their own or another person’s life, health, or safety in an emergency; or to access medical services; or to attend any court, tribunal, New Zealand Parole Board hearing, or other judicial institution that they are required or permitted to attend by that institution; or if a medical officer of health is satisfied that they need to leave to move to another place for isolation or quarantine (for example, for temporary or emergency care while they are sick); or if they are required to move to another place for isolation or quarantine by— a court order; or any other obligation imposed by or under an enactment. In this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires,— chief executive means the chief executive of MBIE confirmed allocation means a confirmed allocation issued under the managed isolation allocation system to a low-risk MIQF managed isolation allocation system means a managed isolation allocation system operated by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government New Zealander means a person who— is a New Zealand citizen; or holds, or is deemed to hold, a permanent resident visa under the Immigration Act 2009. The chief executive is responsible for the operation of the managed isolation allocation system. The chief executive must ensure that the managed isolation allocation system does not at any time permit the issue of more confirmed allocations than the number of available allocations. A person may obtain a confirmed allocation by— registering on the managed isolation allocation system online portal and obtaining a voucher (an online allocation); or applying to the chief executive in the form approved by the chief executive and submitting supporting evidence (an offline allocation). The Minister must determine the apportionment between the issue of online allocations and offline allocations. Online allocations to low-risk MIQFs may be issued on a basis that the Minister decides. In making a decision under subclause (1), the Minister must take into account— the right of New Zealanders to enter New Zealand; and the need to mitigate, so far as possible, the social, economic, and other impacts of COVID-19. The basis on which online allocations to low-risk MIQFs are issued may— distinguish between different classes of persons entering New Zealand (for example, between New Zealanders and non-New Zealanders); and prioritise allocations as between different classes of persons; and reserve for a particular class, or any classes, of persons a specific proportion of allocations. Offline allocations to low-risk MIQFs may be issued to persons meeting the criteria decided by the Minister and published from time to time by the chief executive on MBIE’s Internet site. A person may apply to the chief executive for an offline allocation and the chief executive must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, determine that application. If the chief executive is satisfied that an application meets the criteria, the chief executive may issue to the applicant an offline allocation to a low-risk MIQF. The chief executive of MBIE may at any time— amend an online or offline allocation issued to any person (for example, if the starting date for isolation specified in an offline allocation issued to an individual is required to be changed because of a travel delay): cancel an online or offline allocation issued to any person (for example, if the person no longer requires the allocation, or can no longer use the allocation because of a cancelled flight). The chief executive of MBIE may appoint a person as the site manager or deputy site manager of an MIQF if— the person is employed or engaged by the Crown; and the chief executive considers that the person is suitably qualified to manage an MIQF. A person must not enter an MIQF unless— the site manager has approved their entry (subject to any reasonable conditions); or they are authorised or required by law to enter the MIQF. However, a person who is not otherwise authorised or required by law to enter an MIQF may do so without approval if— they need to enter to preserve or protect a person’s life, health, or safety in an emergency; and it is not reasonably practicable to obtain approval. A person who enters an MIQF in breach of clause 17 must remain at the MIQF for as long as is reasonably required by the site manager in order for— a suitably qualified health practitioner to assess whether the person is at risk of having been exposed to COVID-19 as a result of their entry; and if the health practitioner determines that the person is at risk of having been exposed, a medical officer of health— to be advised; and to determine whether to exercise, in relation to the person, a power conferred on the officer by or under an enactment. To avoid doubt, subclause (1) does not empower the site manager or the health practitioner to require the person to undergo a medical examination or testing of any kind. In this Part,— former border order means— the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020 (the former air border order); and the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order 2020 (the former maritime border order) former security order means the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Security of Managed Isolation and Quarantine Facilities) Order 2020. This clause applies to a person if, immediately before the commencement of this order, they were still required to be isolated or quarantined— in accordance with clause 7(1)﻿(b) and (c) of the former air border order; or in a managed facility in accordance with clause 20(2) of the former maritime border order. The requirements in Part 1 of this order apply in place of the requirements for isolation or quarantine in the former border orders, and— the person is a relevant person under this order; and the period for which the person must be isolated or quarantined is determined by this order; but the person’s place of isolation or quarantine determined under the former border order must be treated as if it were their place of isolation or quarantine under this order. A facility that, immediately before the commencement of this order,— was a high risk facility under a former border order must be treated as if it were a high-risk MIQF under this order: was a low risk facility under a former border order must be treated as if it were a low-risk MIQF under this order. Any authorisation given, condition imposed, or direction made in accordance with a former border order, as it relates to requirements for isolation or quarantine described by clause 2(1) of this schedule, must be treated as if it were given, imposed, or made in accordance with Part 1 of this order. Any appointment made, approval given, or condition or requirement imposed in accordance with the former security order must be treated as if it were made, given, or imposed in accordance with Part 2 of this order.

The lesser charge must be calculated on a pro rata basis (rounded up to a number of whole days). An other critical worker’s supporting agency is liable to pay any charges in respect of the other critical worker and any spouse, partner, or child of the other critical worker.

Nothing in this order limits the immunities of a foreign State ship or its crew. Section 103 of the Immigration Act 2009 (which specifies obligations on persons arriving in New Zealand) applies to every person on board a ship that is permitted to arrive in New Zealand in accordance with this order. Nothing in this order affects any immigration requirements under any enactment. A New Zealand ship or a New Zealand warship is not permitted to arrive in New Zealand unless the master of the ship is reasonably satisfied that every person on board the ship is— a New Zealand citizen; or a person who may travel to and be in New Zealand under section 14(1) of the Immigration Act 2009 (which relates to visa requirements for non-New Zealand citizens). In this clause, New Zealand ship has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Maritime Transport Act 1994. Foreign ships are not permitted to arrive in New Zealand. Despite subclause (1), a foreign ship is permitted to arrive in New Zealand if it is exercising, in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the right of — innocent passage through the territorial sea; or transit passage through straits used for international navigation. In this clause,— foreign ship has the same meaning as in clause 1(1) of Schedule 5A of the Customs and Excise Act 2018 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has the same meaning as Convention in section 2 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea Act 1996. Despite clause 9, the ships specified in subclause (2) are permitted to arrive in New Zealand if every person on board the ship is— a New Zealand citizen; or a person who may travel to and be in New Zealand under section 14(1) of the Immigration Act 2009 (which relates to visa requirements for non-New Zealand citizens). The specified ships are— an Antarctic ship: a cargo ship that is arriving in New Zealand for the purpose of loading or unloading cargo: a fishing ship that is— unloading its catch; or reprovisioning or refuelling, or both; or embarking or disembarking its crew under clauses 16 to 18: a foreign State ship that has been granted diplomatic clearance by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade: a ship that meets the following requirements: there is a compelling need for the ship to arrive in New Zealand— for reprovisioning or refuelling, or both; or for the purpose of delivering the ship to a business, including for the purpose of repairing or refitting the ship; and the Director-General has granted the ship permission to arrive in New Zealand: a ship that has been granted permission to arrive in New Zealand by the Director-General (after consulting any relevant agencies) for humanitarian reasons or other compelling needs. In this clause, cargo ship means a ship that is a commercial craft and that is carrying primarily cargo into or out of New Zealand. Clauses 8 to 10 do not apply if— a ship is in distress; or  it is necessary for a ship to arrive in New Zealand to preserve human life. A person who arrives in New Zealand on board a ship may not disembark the ship except as permitted by subclauses (2) and (4) and clauses 13, 14, and 16. If a person wishes to disembark the ship in order to enter and be in New Zealand under section 13(1) or 14(1)﻿(b) of the Immigration Act 2009, the person must first remain in isolation or quarantine on the ship for at least 14 days. For the purposes of subclause (2), the period of 14 days is counted as follows: if the ship is an Antarctic ship, the period of 14 days is counted from the more recent of— the time at which the ship was last at a port; and the time at which the ship last took a person on board; and for all other ships, the period of 14 days is counted from the time at which the ship arrived in New Zealand. However, if a new person joins a ship that has on board a person described in subclause (2), the period of 14 days described in subclause (3)— starts for the new person at the time the new person joins the ship; and starts again for the person described in subclause (2) at the time the new person joins the ship. If a person is unable or unwilling to remain in isolation or quarantine on the ship on which the person arrived, a medical officer of health or a health protection officer may transfer the person to a managed facility for the purpose of remaining in isolation or quarantine there in accordance with clause 20(2). A person who arrives in New Zealand on board a ship must report for, and submit to, medical examination and testing, if directed by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer, at any time during their required period of isolation or quarantine. In this clause, new person— means a person who has arrived in New Zealand and has not completed the required period of isolation or quarantine in accordance with this clause; and includes an excluded arrival within the meaning of clause 4(1) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020. A person may disembark from the ship on which they arrived to undertake an essential task, including (without limitation)— loading and unloading cargo from the ship on which the person arrived: maintaining the ship on which the person arrived: undertaking safety checks: undertaking necessary preparations of the ship on which the person arrived (for example, rigging gangways). A person who disembarks from a ship under subclause (1) to undertake an essential task must take reasonable steps to minimise the risk of spreading COVID-19, including— remaining as close as is reasonably possible to the ship: maintaining physical distancing (to the greatest extent practicable) from any person who did not arrive in New Zealand on the same ship: wearing personal protective equipment if it is necessary for the person to come into close contact with another person who did not arrive in New Zealand on the same ship: following the directions of an enforcement officer. A person is permitted to disembark from the ship on which they arrived— if it is necessary to do so, as a matter of emergency, to preserve their own or any other person’s life or safety; or if it is necessary to do so to access any court or tribunal; or if a medical officer of health or a health protection officer is satisfied it is necessary for the person to do so to access medical services; or if required by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer to move to a managed facility; or if required to do so under Part 4 of the Health Act 1956; or if required by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer to move to another temporary or emergency managed facility (for example, if necessary for care while sick); or if required to move to another managed facility in compliance with— a court order; or any other obligations imposed by or under any enactment that are related to the detention of the person (for example, a direction of the New Zealand Parole Board or a probation officer); or to assist or accompany a child or other person to travel to or from a place under any of paragraphs (b) to (h), with the consent of a medical officer of health or a health protection officer. However, the permissions specified in subclause (1) apply only if the person has, where practicable, advised, and complied with any reasonable directions of, an enforcement officer. A person is also permitted to leave the ship on which they arrived for any exceptional reason, as authorised by the Director-General (with or without conditions). Before authorising a person to leave under subclause (3), the Director-General must,— if the Director-General has all the functions of a medical officer of health (or otherwise on the advice of a medical officer of health), take into account any impact that the person’s leaving the ship might have on the risk of an outbreak, or the spread, of COVID-19; and be satisfied, on the basis of the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner, that the person meets the low risk indicators; and be satisfied that the person will comply with any conditions of the authorisation. In this clause, health practitioner has the same meaning as in section 5(1) of the Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003. For the purposes of this clause, a person meets the low risk indicators if— the person submits to a medical test for COVID-19 and the result of that test is negative; and any other medical tests or information relating to the person indicates that the person is at low risk of having or transmitting COVID-19. Subclause (6)﻿(a) does not apply in relation to a person who has particular physical or other needs that a medical officer of health or health protection officer determines would make it inappropriate for the person to undertake the medical test. Clause 12 does not apply if the person arrives in New Zealand on a ship— that has been at sea for at least 29 consecutive days; and on which no person has had contact with any other person other than those people who were on board the ship at the time of its most recent departure from New Zealand or another country; and that has arrived in accordance with sections 17 to 29 of the Customs and Excise Act 2018; and in respect of which a medical officer of health or a health protection officer is reasonably satisfied that no person on board has displayed symptoms of COVID-19. If the person meets the requirements specified in subclause (1)﻿(b), (c), and (d), but arrives in New Zealand from a point outside New Zealand on a ship that has been at sea for less than 29 consecutive days, clause 12 applies to the person for the number of days that would be needed to make 28 consecutive days. If a person described in subclause (2) arrives in New Zealand from a point outside New Zealand on a ship that has been at sea for 25 consecutive days beginning at 9 am on the first day, the person would be subject to clause 12 for 3 more days ending immediately before 9 am on the last day (25 + 3 = 28). People on the following ships are exempt from clause 12: a New Zealand Government ship: a New Zealand warship: a foreign State ship. In this clause, New Zealand Government ship has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, and Exclusive Economic Zone Act 1977. This clause applies to a crew member who— wishes to— disembark the ship on which the crew member arrived in New Zealand; or leave the managed facility to which the crew member is transferred after arriving in New Zealand; and wishes to depart from New Zealand; and has not completed the required period of isolation or quarantine in accordance with clause 12. The crew member may, despite clause 20(2), travel from the ship or the managed facility to— the nearest security designated aerodrome to board an aircraft that is scheduled to leave New Zealand; or board a ship that is scheduled to leave New Zealand. If the international flight that the crew member wishes to board does not depart on the same day that the crew member disembarks the ship, a medical officer of health or a health protection officer must transfer the crew member to a managed facility for the purpose of remaining in isolation or quarantine there in accordance with clause 20(2) or until the international flight departs, whichever happens first. The crew member must travel from the ship or managed facility to the security designated aerodrome, departing ship, or managed facility— in accordance with the directions of a medical officer of health or a health protection officer; and as quickly and directly as is reasonably practicable; and using only dedicated private transport. For the purposes of subclause (2), leave New Zealand, in relation to an aircraft or a ship scheduled to leave New Zealand, includes to travel to another place or places in New Zealand before departing from New Zealand.  This clause applies to a crew member who has arrived in New Zealand at a security designated aerodrome— from a point outside New Zealand on board an aircraft; and for the purpose of boarding a ship that is scheduled to depart from New Zealand as soon as is reasonably practicable. The crew member must travel from the security designated aerodrome to the ship referred to in subclause (1)﻿(b). The crew member must travel from the security designated aerodrome to the ship— in accordance with the directions of a medical officer of health or a health protection officer; and as quickly and directly as is reasonably practicable; and using only dedicated private transport. This clause applies to a crew member who has arrived in New Zealand at a security designated aerodrome— from a point outside New Zealand on board an aircraft; and for the purpose of boarding a ship that is not scheduled to depart from New Zealand as soon as is reasonably practicable. The crew member must travel from the security designated aerodrome to a managed facility for the purpose of remaining in isolation or quarantine there in accordance with clause 20(2). The crew member must travel from the security designated aerodrome to the managed facility— in accordance with the directions of a medical officer of health or a health protection officer; and as quickly and directly as is reasonably practicable; and using only dedicated private transport. If a conflict arises between paragraph (b) of the definition of excluded arrival in clause 4(1) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020 and clauses 17 and 18 of this order, clauses 17 and 18 prevail. Before entering a managed facility in accordance with this order, a person must report for, and submit themselves to, the medical examination and testing specified in clause 7(2) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020. Clauses 7(1)﻿(b) to (d), (2), (3), and (4), 8, and 9 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Air Border) Order 2020 apply to a person who is in isolation or quarantine in a managed facility under this order. Clause 16(2) overrides subclause (2). A person who boards a qualifying ship to undertake a necessary task must take reasonable steps to minimise the risk of an outbreak, or the spread, of COVID-19, including by— maintaining physical distancing (to the greatest extent practicable) from any person who is in isolation or quarantine; and wearing personal protective equipment. For the purposes of this clause, qualifying ship means a ship that— arrives in New Zealand from a point outside New Zealand on, after, or up to 14 days before, the commencement of this clause; and at the time of entering New Zealand, has— 1 or more persons on board who are in isolation or quarantine under clause 12; or no one on board who has disembarked the ship while it is in New Zealand. Parts 2 and 3 do not apply to a ship carrying out any of the following permitted shipping movements, for the duration of the movement: a ship arriving in New Zealand, if that ship was previously at a New Zealand port and left New Zealand only to do 1 or both of the following: support an offshore platform on the continental shelf: support another ship operating offshore: a ship entering a New Zealand port, if that ship— is a fishing ship; and was previously at a New Zealand port; and left New Zealand to operate in 1 or more of the following: New Zealand’s exclusive economic zone: the high seas: the exclusive economic zone of another State. The movements specified in subclause (1)﻿(a) are permitted shipping movements only if the people on the ship have not interacted with people from another ship or place other than those that the ship is supporting. The movement specified in subclause (1)﻿(b) is a permitted shipping movement only if the people on the ship— have not interacted with people from another ship; and have not embarked or disembarked any crew member. In this clause,— continental shelf has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Continental Shelf Act 1964 high seas has the same meaning as in clause 1(1) of Schedule 5A of the Customs and Excise Act 2018. The order made on 31 March 2020 under section 70 of the Health Act 1956 is revoked. This clause applies to a person if, immediately before 11.59 pm on 30 June 2020, that person— was in isolation or quarantine under the former order; or had arrived in New Zealand by sea and would have been required to be, but had not yet been, isolated or quarantined under the former order. The requirements of this order apply in place of the former order. To avoid doubt, the period for which the person is to remain in isolation or quarantine must be determined in accordance with clause 12 of this order. In this clause, former order means the order made on 31 March 2020 under section 70 of the Health Act 1956. Dated at Wellington this 26th day of June 2020. This order comes into force at 11.59 pm on 30 June 2020. The purpose of this order is to prevent, and limit the risk of, an outbreak, or the spread, of COVID-19 by restricting which ships may arrive in New Zealand and putting in place isolation or quarantine requirements for people who arrive in New Zealand by sea. This order replaces the order made on 31 March 2020 under section 70 of the Health Act 1956 and will remain under active review. This order is intended to provide greater certainty for safe maritime activities to take place that contribute to New Zealand’s economy. It restricts the entry of foreign ships into New Zealand, with specific exemptions. The order regularises the movement of cargo and permits the entry of ships for refitting and repair by the boat building industry, or for New Zealand operating purposes. This order also puts in place stronger isolation or quarantine requirements for people arriving by sea, with specific exemptions, in order to minimise the risk of transmission of COVID-19. People arriving by sea will be required to be isolated or quarantined on the ship for 14 days upon arrival or to transfer to a managed facility if isolation or quarantine on the ship is not possible or a person is unable or unwilling to remain in isolation or quarantine on the ship. This order’s isolation or quarantine requirements do not affect the immunities of foreign State ships. If the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade grants diplomatic clearance for a foreign State ship to arrive in New Zealand, it will do so subject to conditions that reflect the requirements in this order for ships that are not foreign State ships. This order also allows for maritime crew changes. It sets out requirements for maritime crew arriving by air and transferring directly to a ship. In addition, the order does not affect the obligations of persons arriving on ships to meet immigration requirements. A person who does not comply with this order commits an offence under section 26 or 27 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. An enforcement officer under that Act will have the authority to exercise powers under sections 20 to 25 of that Act.

For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(b), the foreign ships are— a cargo ship that is arriving in New Zealand for the purpose of loading or unloading cargo: a fishing ship that is— unloading its catch; or reprovisioning or refuelling, or both; or embarking or disembarking its crew under Part 4: a foreign State ship that has been granted diplomatic clearance by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade: a ship that has been granted permission to arrive in New Zealand by the Director-General in accordance with clause 11. The Director-General may give permission for a ship to arrive in New Zealand only if— all of the persons on board the ship are able to travel to New Zealand in accordance with the Immigration Act 2009; or the ship is seeking permission to arrive in New Zealand for the purpose of— reprovisioning or refuelling, or both; or carrying out a refit or a refurbishment of, or a repair to, the ship that is more than minor; or delivering the ship to a business; or there is a compelling need for the ship to arrive in New Zealand for humanitarian reasons.

Before permitting a ship to arrive in New Zealand under clause 11, the Director-General must take into account— the public health risk of the ship arriving in New Zealand; and the resources available to manage that risk. The Director-General must consult any relevant agencies before permitting a ship to arrive in New Zealand under clause 11(1), including (without limitation)— Maritime New Zealand; and the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment; and the Ministry of Transport; and the New Zealand Customs Service. Clauses 8 and 9(1) do not apply to a ship if— the ship is in distress; or  it is necessary for the ship to arrive in New Zealand to preserve human life. This clause applies to the master of a ship that is— permitted to arrive in New Zealand under clause 8, 10(1), or 11(1); and travelling to New Zealand. The master must give at least 168 hours’ notice before the ship arrives in New Zealand. However, if it is not practicable for the master to give at least 168 hours’ notice of arrival, the master must instead give notice when the ship departs for New Zealand from a port or other place outside New Zealand. A notice of arrival must be completed and delivered in the manner and form specified by the Director-General under clause 15. The master must provide an update of progress before arrival if requested by an enforcement officer. Nothing in this clause limits or affects the need to comply with the following requirements: notice requirements under the Biosecurity Act 1993: notice requirements under the Customs and Excise Act 2018: any other lawful requirement to give notice of the intended arrival of a ship in New Zealand. The Director-General must specify the form of a notice of arrival and the manner in which— the form is to be completed; and notice is to be given. A notice of arrival must contain the following information: information about the ship, including— the name of the ship; and its country of registration; and  any relevant registration number; and information about the ship’s voyage, including— the intended port or other place of arrival in New Zealand; and the estimated time and date of arrival in New Zealand; and the port or other place outside New Zealand that the ship has most recently visited; and the time at which and date on which the ship departed from that port or other place; and the last contact any person on board the ship has had since departing from that port or other place; and information about the persons on board the ship, including— the name of the ship’s master; and the numbers of crew and passengers on board the ship; and the number of people wishing to disembark the ship in New Zealand; and information about whether, to the best knowledge of the ship’s master,— any person on board the ship has had, in the 14 days prior to the notice being given, symptoms that suggest the presence of COVID-19; and any person on board the ship is currently experiencing any symptoms that suggest the presence of COVID-19. A notice of arrival may contain any other information that the Director-General thinks necessary for the purpose of clause 14. The Director-General must publish the form on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government. The master of any ship intending to arrive in New Zealand must, before the ship arrives in New Zealand, take reasonable steps to ensure that every person on board the ship is aware of the isolation or quarantine requirements under this Part. A person who arrives in New Zealand on board a ship must remain in isolation or quarantine for at least 14 days— on board that ship; or at a place of isolation or quarantine in accordance with clause 19(2). A person who is in isolation or quarantine on board a ship under subsection (1) must remain in isolation or quarantine on board that ship until all the persons who arrived in New Zealand on board that ship (or were transferred to that ship under this order) meet the low-risk indictors. For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(a), the period of 14 days is counted from the most recent of the following: the time at which and date on which the ship last departed for New Zealand from a port or other place outside New Zealand: the time and date of the person’s last contact, counted from the time at which the contact ended: the time at which and date on which a new person joins the ship. For the purposes of subclause (1)﻿(b), if a person is transferred from the ship to a place of isolation and quarantine, the time spent in isolation or quarantine on board the ship, if continuous, may be counted when determining, under any other order, whether the person has been in isolation or quarantine at that place for a period of at least 14 days. A person who arrives in New Zealand on board a ship may not disembark the ship except in accordance with this order. A person who arrives in New Zealand on board a ship (person A) must wear personal protective equipment while another person is on board the ship to perform a necessary task (person B) if person A is likely to come within 2 metres of person B. For the purposes of this clause, person includes any exempt crew member. An authorised officer may transfer a person who arrives in New Zealand on board a ship from the ship to a place of isolation or quarantine for the purpose of the person completing their period of isolation or quarantine as required by clause 23, if the officer is reasonably satisfied that the person needs to be transferred— to manage the public health risk; or to isolate or quarantine the person safely; or to ensure compliance with this order. An officer may transfer a person under subclause (1) at any time during the period in which the person is in isolation or quarantine in accordance with clause 17(1). In this clause, authorised officer means— a Customs officer; and a medical officer of health or a health protection officer; and any other enforcement officer acting on the direction of that medical officer of health or health protection officer. A person is permitted to disembark a ship on which they have arrived in New Zealand only if authorised to do so by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer. Before authorising a person to disembark a ship, the medical officer of health or the health protection officer must be satisfied that— the person has met the requirements of clause 17(1); and no person on board the ship has, in the previous 14 days, experienced any symptoms that suggest the presence of COVID-19. Subclause (4) applies if— the medical officer of health or the health protection officer is not satisfied that the criteria specified in subclause (2) are met; and the person wishes to disembark the ship. The officer may transfer the person to a place of isolation or quarantine for the purpose of the person completing their period of isolation or quarantine as required by clause 23. Despite clause 19(2)﻿(a), a person who has not completed the period of isolation or quarantine under clause 17(1) may disembark the ship on which they arrived in New Zealand— if it is necessary for the person to do so to preserve or protect a person’s life, health, or safety in an emergency; or if it is necessary for the person to do so to attend a court, tribunal, New Zealand Parole Board hearing, or other judicial institution that the person is required or permitted to attend by that institution; or if a medical officer of health or a health protection officer is satisfied it is necessary for the person to do so to access medical services; or if the person is required to do so under Part 4 of the Health Act 1956; or if the person is required by an enforcement officer to move to a temporary or emergency place of isolation or quarantine (for example, if necessary for care while sick); or if the person is required to move to a place of isolation or quarantine in compliance with— a court order; or any other obligations imposed by or under any enactment that are related to the detention of the person (for example, a direction of the New Zealand Parole Board or a probation officer); or if it is necessary for the person to do so to assist or accompany a child or other person to travel to or from a place of isolation or quarantine or under any of paragraphs (b) to (f). However, the permissions specified in subclause (1) apply only if the person has, where practicable, complied with any reasonable directions of, or reasonable conditions imposed by, an enforcement officer. Despite clause 19(2)﻿(a), the Director-General may permit a person who has not completed the period of isolation or quarantine under clause 17(1) to disembark the ship on which they arrived in New Zealand if it is necessary for the person to do so for an exceptional reason. Before authorising a person to disembark under subclause (3), the Director-General must— take into account any impact that the person’s disembarking from the ship might have on the risk of an outbreak, or the spread, of COVID-19; and be satisfied, on the basis of the advice of a suitably qualified health practitioner, that the person, and every other person on the ship,— meets the low-risk indicators; and has not, in the previous 14 days, experienced any symptoms that suggest the presence of COVID-19; and be satisfied that the person will comply with any conditions of the authorisation. The Director-General may impose a condition on a permission granted under subclause (3). Despite clause 19(1), a person may disembark the ship on which they arrived in New Zealand to undertake an essential task on, or immediately adjacent to, that ship, including (without limitation)— loading and unloading cargo from the ship: maintaining the ship: undertaking safety checks on the ship: undertaking necessary preparations of the ship (for example, rigging gangways): reporting for and undergoing required testing and medical examination for COVID-19. A person who disembarks a ship in accordance with subclause (1)— must take reasonable steps to minimise the risk of spreading COVID-19, including by— remaining as close as is reasonably practicable to the ship; and maintaining physical distancing (to the greatest extent practicable) from any person who did not arrive in New Zealand on the same ship; and wearing personal protective equipment if it is necessary for the person to come into close contact with another person who did not arrive in New Zealand on the same ship; and following the directions of an enforcement officer; and may do so only to undertake an essential task and may not undertake any other tasks or activities while disembarked. A breach of subclause (2)﻿(a) or (b)﻿ is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. A person who arrives in New Zealand on board a ship must report for and undergo testing and medical examination, if directed by a medical officer of health or a health protection officer, at any time during their required period of isolation or quarantine. Without limiting subclause (1), a medical officer of health or a health protection officer may require a person to report for and undergo testing and medical examination in order to assess, in accordance with this order, whether the person meets the low-risk indicators. Testing and medical examination under subclauses (1) and (2) means testing and medical examination that— must involve taking nose swabs or mouth swabs (or both); and may involve— taking temperatures: carrying out chest auscultation: seeking and obtaining information about symptoms. A person who is transferred to a place of isolation or quarantine under clause 18(1), 19(4), 20(1)﻿(e) or (f), 26(3), 27(3), or 28(2) or (5) must be isolated or quarantined in accordance with the Isolation and Quarantine Order. A person’s start time for the purpose of clause 10(2)﻿(b) of the Isolation and Quarantine Order is as follows: if clause 18(1), 20(1)﻿(e) or (f), 26(3), 27(3), or 28(2) or (5) of this order applies, and the person is in isolation or quarantine immediately before the transfer, the more recent of the following times and dates: the time at which and date on which the ship last departed for New Zealand from a port or other place outside New Zealand: the time and date of the person’s last contact for the purpose of clause 17(2)﻿(b): if clause 19(4) of this order applies, the time at which and date on which the person arrives at their place of isolation or quarantine under the Isolation and Quarantine Order: in any other case, the time at which and date on which the person arrives in New Zealand. This clause applies if a person remains in isolation or quarantine on board a ship. No person may board the ship, except a person who undertakes a necessary task. No person may disembark the ship, except a person who undertakes a necessary task or as provided in this order. An enforcement officer may require the ship to remain at least a specified distance away from any other ship, except a ship— in the service of 1 or more of the following agencies: the Ministry of Health: the Ministry for Primary Industries: the New Zealand Customs Service: the New Zealand Police: carrying a person who undertakes a necessary task: needed for the safe navigation, movement, or operation of the ship referred to in subclause (1). The master of the ship must ensure that prescribed isolation or quarantine signage is visible and secure at the place where the ship is berthed. However, an enforcement officer may exempt the master from the requirement specified in subclause (4A). A breach of subclause (2), (4), or (4A) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. In this clause, prescribed isolation or quarantine signage means isolation or quarantine signage— prescribed by the Director-General of Health; and published on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government. A person who undertakes a necessary task and who boards a ship under clause 24 must take reasonable steps to minimise the risk of an outbreak, or the spread, of COVID-19, including by— maintaining physical distancing (to the greatest extent practicable) from any person who is in isolation or quarantine on that ship; and minimising (to the greatest extend practicable) the time that the person spends on the ship; and wearing personal protective equipment of a type, and in a manner, consistent with guidance provided by the regulator for their industry. In this clause, regulator has the same meaning as in section 16 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015. This clause applies to a crew member who— wishes to— disembark the ship on which the crew member arrived in New Zealand; or leave the place of isolation or quarantine to which the crew member is transferred after arriving in New Zealand; and wishes to depart from New Zealand; and has not completed their required period of isolation or quarantine in accordance with clause 17(1). Despite clauses 17(1), 19(1), and 23(1) of this order and anything in the Isolation and Quarantine Order, the crew member may travel directly from the ship or the place of isolation or quarantine— to the nearest security designated aerodrome to board an aircraft that is scheduled to depart from New Zealand on the same day; or to board a ship as close to the time of departure as is reasonably practicable. A medical officer of health or a health protection officer must transfer the crew member to a place of isolation or quarantine for the purpose of the crew member completing their period of isolation or quarantine as required by clause 23 if— the international flight that the crew member wishes to board does not depart from New Zealand on the same day that the crew member disembarks the ship; or the ship that the crew member wishes to board does not depart from New Zealand as soon as is reasonably practicable. A crew member transferred under subclause (3) may leave their place of isolation or quarantine to— travel to the nearest security designated aerodrome to board an aircraft that is scheduled to depart from New Zealand on the same day; or board a ship as close to the time of departure as is reasonably practicable. A crew member or an organisation representing the crew member must— give at least 96 hours’ notice to an enforcement officer that the crew member is required to transfer to a place of isolation or quarantine; and advise an enforcement officer as soon as practicable of any changes to time frames related to the crew member’s travel. This clause applies to an exempt crew member who has arrived in New Zealand— at a security designated aerodrome on board an aircraft; and for the purpose of— boarding a ship that is scheduled to depart from New Zealand as soon as is reasonably practicable; and departing from New Zealand as a crew member of that ship. The exempt crew member may travel from the security designated aerodrome to the departing ship. If the ship does not depart from New Zealand as soon as is reasonably practicable, a medical officer of health or a health protection officer may transfer the crew member to a place of isolation or quarantine for the purpose of the crew member completing their period of isolation or quarantine as required by clause 23 or until the ship departs, whichever happens first. Subclause (2) applies to a crew member who has arrived in New Zealand— at a security designated aerodrome on board an aircraft; and for the purpose of boarding a ship that is scheduled to depart from New Zealand but not as soon as is reasonably practicable. The crew member must travel from the security designated aerodrome to a place of isolation or quarantine for the purpose of the crew member completing their period of isolation or quarantine as required by clause 23 or until the ship departs, whichever happens first. To avoid doubt, clause 26(1) and (2) applies to a crew member specified in subclause (1). Subclause (5) applies to a crew member who has arrived in New Zealand— at a security designated aerodrome on board an aircraft; and for the purpose of boarding a ship that is scheduled to travel to another port or place in New Zealand without departing from New Zealand. The crew member must travel from the security designated aerodrome to a place of isolation or quarantine for the purpose of the crew member completing their period of isolation or quarantine as required by clause 23. A crew member of a ship who, under this order, is required to travel from a ship, a security designated aerodrome, or a place of isolation or quarantine to a security designated aerodrome, a departing ship or another ship, or a place of isolation or quarantine must do so— in accordance with directions of the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment, given on advice from a medical officer of health or a health protection officer; and as quickly and directly as is reasonably practicable. A breach of subclause (1)﻿(a) or (b) is an infringement offence for the purposes of section 26(3) of the Act. Persons on the following ships are exempt from clauses 14 to 23: a New Zealand Government ship: a New Zealand warship: a foreign State ship. Parts 2 and 3 do not apply to a ship during the time that it is carrying out any of the permitted shipping movements specified in subclause (2), if all persons on board the ship to whom clause 17(1) applies have completed the required period of isolation or quarantine. The permitted shipping movements are— arriving in New Zealand, if the ship was previously at a New Zealand port and left New Zealand only to do 1 or both of the following: support an offshore installation: support another ship operating offshore: entering a New Zealand port, if the ship— is a fishing ship; and was previously at a New Zealand port; and left New Zealand to operate in 1 or more of the following: New Zealand’s exclusive economic zone: the high seas: the exclusive economic zone of another State: arriving in another New Zealand port from a port in the Chatham Islands, if the ship was previously at another New Zealand port and travelled only to the Chatham Islands port. The movement specified in subclause (2)﻿(a) is a permitted shipping movement only if no person on the ship has interacted with a person from another ship or place other than those that the ship is supporting. The movement specified in subclause (2)﻿(b) is a permitted shipping movement only if— no person on the ship has interacted with a person from another ship; and no crew member has embarked or disembarked since the ship was previously at a New Zealand port. The permitted shipping movements specified in subclause (2) are subject to compliance with reasonable directions given by an enforcement officer for the purpose of this clause. The Minister may exempt any person or class of persons from the requirement to comply with any provision of this order or the application of any provision of this order if the Minister is satisfied that— the exemption is necessary or desirable in order to promote the purposes of the Act or the purposes of this order; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters giving rise to the exemption. The Minister may impose conditions on the exemption as the Minister considers necessary. The Minister must take into account the advice of the Director-General when deciding— whether to grant an exemption; and what (if any) conditions to impose on an exemption. An exemption for any specified person must be notified in writing to the applicant and the exempt person. An exemption for any class of persons must— be published on a publicly accessible Internet site maintained by or on behalf of the New Zealand Government; and be notified in the Gazette. The COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order 2020 (LI 2020/134) is revoked. Any ship or person subject to a specified period of isolation or quarantine under the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order 2020 immediately before the commencement of this order must comply with the corresponding requirement in this order, and time spent in isolation or quarantine during that period counts for the purpose of this order. Every permission granted by the Director-General under clause 10(2)﻿(e) or (f) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Maritime Border) Order 2020 continues to have effect as if granted under clause 11(1) of this order.

Having considered the application against the criteria in the COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track Consenting) Act 2020 (the Act) and the Act’s purpose, and having sought and considered written comments from the relevant Ministers, relevant local authorities, and the New Zealand Transport Agency, the Minister for the Environment has accepted this application for referral for the following reasons: the project will help to achieve the purpose of the Act; and the project offers the opportunity for up to 650 full-time equivalent jobs and for additional permanent jobs through commercial activities; and the project will provide economic benefits to those in the Central Otago area and to the viticulture and construction industries, which have been affected by COVID-19; and the project will increase housing supply in an area experiencing rapid population change and housing shortages; and the project will contribute to a well-functioning urban environment, given its location close to the Cromwell town centre and within an area identified in the Cromwell Spatial Plan as being suitable for residential intensification; and the project will enable construction to occur sooner than would otherwise be the case under the standard processes of the Resource Management Act 1991; and any adverse effects arising from the activities that are to occur under the project and potential mitigation measures can be tested by an expert consenting panel, having regard to Part 2 of the Resource Management Act 1991 and the purpose of the Act. This order, which comes into force on 5 March 2021, amends the COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track Consenting) Referred Projects Order 2020. The effect of the amendment is to refer a project to an expert consenting panel for the purpose of the COVID-19 Recovery (Fast-track Consenting) Act 2020 (the Act). The referred project is the project named and described in new Schedule 13. The effect of the referral is to authorise Wooing Tree Property Development LP to apply under the Act, instead of under the Resource Management Act 1991, for resource consents relating to the project described in new Schedule 13. The expert consenting panel will be appointed under Schedule 5 of the Act and make decisions in accordance with Schedule 6 of the Act.",https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2021/0036/latest/whole.html
2021-04-14T14:53:41,COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) (Exemptions from Companies Act 1993) Notice 2021," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. Pursuant to section 26 of the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020, the Registrar of Companies, having satisfied the requirements in section 27 of that Act, gives the following notice. This notice is the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) (Exemptions from Companies Act 1993) Notice 2021. This notice comes into force on the day after the date of its notification in the Gazette. This notice is revoked on the close of 31 March 2021. In this notice, unless the context otherwise requires,— Act means the Companies Act 1993 relevant provision, in relation to an exemption in this notice, means the provision of the Act in respect of which a person is relying on the exemption. Any term or expression that is defined in the Act and used, but not defined, in this notice has the same meaning as in the Act. The exemptions in this notice apply to acts or omissions that occur within the period that starts on 21 March 2020 and ends on 31 March 2021. For the purposes of this clause, an omission includes a failure to comply with a relevant provision within the time frame required by the Act. A company or an overseas company (A) or an administrator (B) of a company or an overseas company qualifies for an exemption from a relevant provision only if a majority of A’s directors or B (as applicable) believes, on reasonable grounds, that— complying with the provision is unduly onerous or burdensome because of the effects of COVID-19; or the provision is not reasonably capable of being complied with because of the effects of COVID-19. A company (A) is exempted from section 120 of the Act (annual meeting of shareholders) to the extent that that section requires A to comply,— for the first annual meeting of shareholders, within 18 months after A’s registration; and for any subsequent annual meeting,— not later than 6 months after A’s balance date; and not later than 15 months after the previous annual meeting. The exemption in clause 7 is subject to the conditions that the company (A) complies with section 120 of the Act,— for the first annual meeting of shareholders,— within 24 months after A’s registration; and not later than 31 March 2021; and for any subsequent annual meetings,— not later than 12 months after A’s balance date; and not later than 21 months after the previous annual meeting; and not later than 31 March 2021; and gives notice to the Registrar as required under clause 15. A company or an overseas company (A) is exempted from the following provisions of the Act to the extent that they require A to comply within 5 months after A’s balance date: section 201 (financial statements must be prepared); and section 202 (group financial statements must be prepared); and section 207E (financial statements must be registered). If an overseas company is exempted from section 201 or 202 of the Act, it is also exempted from section 204(1) and (2) of the Act (financial statements for overseas company must include financial statements for large New Zealand business) to the extent that the Act requires the overseas company to comply within 5 months after its balance date.  The exemptions in clause 9 are subject to the conditions that the company or overseas company (A)— complies with each relevant provision— as soon as practicable after the expiry of the period of 5 months after A’s balance date (whether that period expires before or after this notice comes into force); and not later than 31 March 2021; and gives notice to the Registrar as required under clause 15. A company (A) is exempted from section 208 of the Act (obligation to prepare annual report) to the extent that that section requires A to comply within 5 months after A’s balance date. A is exempted from section 209(1)﻿(a) of the Act, which is about sending shareholders a copy of the annual report, to the extent that A must comply not less than 20 working days before the date fixed for holding the annual meeting of shareholders. The exemptions in clause 11 are subject to the conditions that the company (A)— complies with section 208 of the Act— within 11 months after A’s balance date; and not later than 31 March 2021; and complies with section 209(1)﻿(a) of the Act— at least 10 working days before the date fixed for holding the annual meeting of shareholders (whether or not that date is fixed in reliance on an exemption in clause 7); and not later than 16 March 2021 (which is 10 working days before 31 March 2021); and gives notice to the Registrar as required under clause 15. The administrator (B) of a company or an overseas company is exempted from section 239AK of the Act to the extent that the Act, in relation to a creditors’ meeting under Part 15A of the Act,— requires B to conduct the meeting in person; and requires a postal vote to be cast by sending a marked voting paper (see clause 7(4) of Schedule 5 of the Act). B is exempted from the following provisions of the Act to the extent that they require a written notice: section 239AL (joint meetings of creditors of related companies in administration); and section 239AO (notice of first and subsequent creditors’ meetings); and section 239AU (notice of watershed meeting). The exemptions in clause 13 are subject to the conditions that the administrator (B) of a company or an overseas company— complies with section 239AK of the Act— as if the Act also allowed B to conduct a creditors’ meeting by means of audio, or audio and visual, communication; and as if clause 7 of Schedule 5 of the Act also allowed a postal vote to be cast using electronic means permitted by B; and complies with sections 239AL, 239AO, and 239AU of the Act as if they also allowed a notice to be given to creditors by electronic means; and gives notice to the Registrar as required under clause 15. This clause applies if this notice requires a company or an overseas company (A) or an administrator (B) to give notice to the Registrar as a condition of an exemption. A or B must give the notice to the Registrar— as soon as practicable after A or B (as applicable) decides to rely on the exemption; and not later than 31 March 2021. The notice must— identify each provision of the Act in respect of which A or B is relying on an exemption; and state why A or B qualifies for each exemption under clause 6; and be signed by a majority of A’s directors or by B (as applicable). To avoid doubt, the notice may be given in written or electronic form. This notice, which comes into force on the day after the date of its notification in the Gazette and is revoked on the close of 31 March 2021, exempts companies, overseas companies, and administrators that were affected by COVID-19 (affected persons) from compliance with certain obligations under the Companies Act 1993 (the Act).  The effect of the exemption is to modify or relax the requirements for affected persons to comply with the following procedural and administrative matters in the Act: time frame requirements in relation to holding annual meetings of shareholders, preparing annual reports, and sending annual reports to shareholders (under sections 120, 208, and 209 of the Act respectively); and time frame requirements in relation to the financial reporting requirements under sections 201, 202, 204, and 207E of the Act; and certain meeting, voting, and notice requirements in sections 239AK, 239AL, 239AO, and 239AU of the Act that do not clearly provide for holding meetings remotely, voting electronically, and giving notices electronically. The above time frame extensions do not allow the time for compliance to be extended beyond 31 March 2021, and some extensions are limited to a defined period. The exemptions only apply— in respect of acts or omissions that occurred during the period that started on 21 March 2020 and that ends on 31 March 2021; and if the majority of directors or the administrator of the company or overseas company believes, on reasonable grounds, that— complying with the relevant provision is unduly onerous or burdensome because of the effects of COVID-19; or the relevant provision is not reasonably capable of being complied with because of the effects of COVID-19; and if the affected person— notifies the Registrar of Companies that it is relying on the exemption; and complies with the specified conditions. The Registrar of Companies (the Registrar) considers it appropriate to grant the exemptions because the Registrar is satisfied that— granting the exemptions is necessary or desirable to enable the modification or relaxation of certain procedural or administrative requirements in the Act that— are unduly onerous or burdensome because of the effects of COVID-19; or may not be reasonably capable of being complied with because of the effects of COVID-19; and the extent of the exemption is not broader than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemption; and the exemption is the most appropriate way of addressing those matters at this time. The Registrar considers that the effects of COVID-19 mean that it has been or will be difficult to meet certain prescribed deadlines and requirements relating to holding meetings, voting, and giving notice. The exemptions only apply in respect of acts or omissions in the period starting on 21 March 2020 (when many companies ceased or reduced operations as part of New Zealand’s COVID-19 public health response) and ending on 31 March 2021. In addition, the exemptions only apply if the affected person notifies the Registrar that they intend to rely on the exemption and believes, on reasonable grounds, that the effects of COVID-19 mean that compliance with the relevant provision is unduly burdensome or onerous, or that they are not reasonably capable of complying with the relevant provision. Extending time to meet deadlines and taking a flexible approach regarding meeting, voting, and notice requirements will help affected persons to meet their obligations in a safe, efficient, and orderly manner, without facing unreasonable compliance costs.

2021-04-14T14:03:07,COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) (Extension) Order 2020," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. This order is made under section 42 of the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020— on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council; and on the joint recommendation of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, made in accordance with section 42(6) to (8) of that Act. This order is the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) (Extension) Order 2020. This order comes into force on 30 November 2020. In this order, Act means the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020. The following are extended for a further period that starts on 1 December 2020 and ends on the close of 31 March 2021: in relation to all entities, the application of each of sections 10 and 13 of the Act: all powers to grant exemptions under section 26 of the Act: the power to grant relief under section 30 of the Act. This order is revoked on 1 April 2021. This order, which comes into force on 30 November 2020 and is revoked on 1 April 2021, extends the application of sections 10 and 13 of the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020 (the Act), and the powers under sections 26 and 30 of the Act, until the close of 31 March 2021. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs are satisfied that this order is necessary and desirable to address the effects of COVID-19, and that the period of each extension is no longer than is reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to it, because the harm that the Act addresses is the impact of lockdowns on the ability of entities to conduct their business, and it is uncertain how long the risk of lockdowns will exist. Accordingly,— an extension to the application of sections 10 and 13 would enable entities to continue to govern themselves during any lockdowns with confidence that their decisions will not be compromised by any procedural adjustments made reasonably necessary by the outbreak of COVID-19 and allowed under those sections: an extension to the exemption powers under Part 3 of the Act will allow Registrars or relevant Ministers, or the Chief Judge of the Māori Land Court, to continue to grant relief from compliance with certain obligations if the requirements of the Act for granting the exemption are met. This is a reprint of the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) (Extension) Order 2020 that incorporates all the amendments to that order as at the date of the last amendment to it.

2021-04-16T15:42:20,COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) (Māori Trust Boards—Annual Hui) Notice 2021," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. Pursuant to section 26 of the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020, the Minister for Māori Development gives the following notice after complying with section 27 of that Act. This notice is the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) (Māori Trust Boards—Annual Hui) Notice 2021. This notice comes into force on the day after the date of its notification in the Gazette. This notice is revoked on the close of 31 March 2021. In this notice, unless the context otherwise requires,— Act means the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 Māori Trust Board or Board has the meaning given by section 2(1) of the Act. This notice applies to the hui of a Māori Trust Board under section 23C of the Act if— the Board informs the chief executive of Te Puni Kōkiri to the effect that it intends to postpone, or has postponed, the hui because of the effects of COVID-19; and the deadline under section 23C(1) of the Act for holding the hui falls between the start of 21 March 2020 and the close of 31 March 2021. This notice applies to the hui regardless of whether— the Board complies with subclause (1)﻿(a) before, on, or after the commencement of this notice; or the hui is held before, on, or after the commencement of this notice. A Māori Trust Board that is required to hold a hui to which this notice applies is exempt from the deadline for holding the hui under section 23C(1) of the Act. The exemption applies on the condition that the Board hold the hui before the close of 31 March 2021. Sections 23C(2), 23D, and 31(2) of the Act apply to a hui that is held under section 23C(1) in accordance with subclause (2). This notice comes into force on the day after the date of its notification in the Gazette and revokes itself at the close of 31 March 2021. It grants an exemption from section 23C(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 (the Act) to enable annual hui required by that section to be postponed to any time before the close of 31 March 2021. This notice applies to a hui if— the relevant Māori Trust Board informs the chief executive of Te Puni Kōkiri that it intends to postpone, or has postponed, the hui because of the effects of COVID-19; and the deadline under section 23C(1) of the Act for holding the hui falls between the start of 21 March 2020 and the close of 31 March 2021. The Minister for Māori Development has granted the exemption set out in this notice (and is satisfied that it is appropriate) because it is necessary or desirable to ensure that the deadline for holding annual hui under section 23C(1) of the Act is not unduly onerous or burdensome due to the effects of COVID-19. The Minister relied on section 28(3) of the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020 not to engage about the exemptions set out in this notice because the Minister was satisfied that the exemptions benefit Māori Trust Boards and their beneficiaries and do not materially detrimentally affect any person.

2021-04-16T15:54:08,COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) (Māori Trust Boards—Electronic Voting in Elections) Notice 2021," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. Pursuant to section 26 of the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020, the Minister for Māori Development, having satisfied the requirements in section 27 of that Act, gives the following notice. This notice is the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) (Māori Trust Boards—Electronic Voting in Elections) Notice 2021. This notice comes into force on the day after the date of its notification in the Gazette. This notice is revoked on the close of 31 March 2021. In this notice, unless the context otherwise requires,— Act means the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 election means an election to which this notice applies under regulation 5 regulations means the Maori Trust Boards Regulations 1985 returning officer means the returning officer appointed for an election under section 52 of the Act. Any term or expression that is defined in the Act and used, but not defined, in this notice has the same meaning as in the Act. This notice applies to an election for membership of a Māori Trust Board under Part 3 of the Act if— the Board informs the chief executive of Te Puni Kōkiri to the effect that it intends to allow, or has allowed, votes in the election to be cast electronically because of the effects of COVID-19; and the election is held in the relevant period. An election is held in the relevant period if— the public notice of the calling of nominations under section 46(1) of the Act is given after the start of 21 March 2020; and the result of the voting is recorded under regulation 14(3) of the regulations before the close of 31 March 2021. This notice applies to an election regardless of whether— the Board complies with subclause (1)﻿(a) before, on, or after the commencement of this notice; or any aspect of the election is carried out before, on, or after the commencement of this notice. The exemptions set out in subclause (2) apply to an election if the conditions in clause 7 are met. The exemptions are as follows: the secretary of the Māori Trust Board is exempt from regulation 6 of the regulations, but only to the extent necessary to allow the public notice of the calling of nominations to indicate that— nominations may be provided electronically; and votes in the election may be cast electronically: the secretary of the Māori Trust Board is exempt from regulation 9(1) and (2) of the regulations, but only to the extent necessary to allow the ballot papers to indicate that votes may be cast electronically: a beneficiary who casts their vote electronically is exempt from regulation 10 of the regulations: the returning officer for the election is exempt from section 53(1) of the Act, but only to the extent necessary to allow the returning officer to use an electronic system to count the votes that are validly cast electronically: the returning officer for the election is exempt from regulation 14(3) of the regulations, but only to the extent necessary to allow the record of voting to include the results of votes that are cast electronically. The following conditions apply to an election: the system for casting votes electronically must meet the conditions set out in subclause (2); and the returning officer must take reasonable steps to ensure that no more than 1 vote is counted for each beneficiary who casts a vote electronically; and the returning officer must ensure that the results statement provided to the secretary of the Māori Trust Board under regulation 14(4) of the regulations includes the results of all votes validly cast, whether cast by postal ballot or electronically. A system for casting votes electronically must meet the following conditions: it must accurately count the votes that are cast using the system; and it must include reasonable measures for verifying the identity of each person who casts their vote using the system; and it must retain the information entered into, or generated by, the system for the purpose of the election for at least 3 months after the declaration of the result of the election; and if it retains that information in electronic form, it must retain the information in a way that— is secure and otherwise provides a reliable means for assuring that the integrity of the information is retained; and is readily accessible so as to be usable for subsequent reference. This notice comes into force on the day after the date of its notification in the Gazette and revokes itself at the close of 31 March 2021. It grants exemptions from the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 and the Maori Trust Boards Regulations 1985. The exemptions enable votes for membership of a Māori Trust Board to be cast electronically. Usually, a Board’s beneficiaries may vote only by postal ballot. This notice applies to an election if— the relevant Māori Trust Board informs the chief executive of Te Puni Kōkiri that it intends to allow, or has allowed, votes in the election to be cast electronically because of the effects of COVID-19; and the election is held between the start of 21 March 2020 and the close of 31 March 2021. The effect of the exemptions granted by this notice is to enable the following: the public notice of the calling of nominations to indicate that they may be provided electronically and that votes in the election may be cast electronically: ballot papers to indicate that votes may be cast electronically: beneficiaries to vote electronically without needing to sign a hard-copy declaration: votes cast electronically to be counted using an electronic system: the record of voting results to include votes that are cast electronically. The exemptions apply subject to conditions that are set out in regulation 7. They include conditions that apply to the electronic voting system used for the election. The Minister for Māori Development has granted the exemptions set out in this notice (and is satisfied that they are appropriate) for the following reasons: not all beneficiaries live in the immediate vicinity of their Board’s offices and some live overseas: delays caused to postal mail because of the effects of COVID-19 could hinder the ability of beneficiaries to participate in the elections: communities affected by COVID-19 may not be able to prioritise visits to the Post Shop or other mail outlets, and travel and space restrictions may make things more difficult: uncertainty caused by changing COVID-19 alert levels may affect the receipt of postal votes within the statutory time frames under the Act: electronic voting enables easier participation for beneficiaries, reduces significant costs, minimises travel risks and costs, and reduces the need for physical contact. In light of those considerations, permitting voting at elections by electronic means is necessary or desirable to ensure that Board elections can take place no matter what the situation is regarding COVID-19 and any related restrictions. The Minister relied on section 28(3) of the COVID-19 Response (Requirements For Entities—Modifications and Exemptions) Act 2020 not to engage about the exemptions set out in this notice because the Minister was satisfied that the exemptions benefit the Boards and their beneficiaries and do not materially detrimentally affect any person.

This order is made under section 7AAC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council. This order is the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (February 2021) Order 2021. This order comes into force on 23 February 2021. In this order, unless the context otherwise requires,— 7-day period means a period of 7 consecutive days Commissioner means the Commissioner of Inland Revenue CRSP scheme means the COVID-19 resurgence support payment scheme (February 2021) full-time equivalent worker means a person who is an employee and who regularly works 20 or more hours a week part-time equivalent worker means a person who is an employee and who regularly works less than 20 hours per week specified person means— an individual who is self-employed: a body corporate or an unincorporated body: a registered charity: an incorporated society: a post-settlement governance entity: a trust: a partnership (as defined in sections 8 and 9 of the Partnership Law Act 2019): any department of state or organisation in the state services (as defined in section 5 of the Public Service Act 2020) that is approved by the Minister of Finance as a participant in the CRSP scheme: a non-government organisation: a pre-revenue firm: a joint venture. For the purposes of this order, a part-time equivalent worker must be treated as 0.6 of a full-time equivalent worker. The CRSP scheme is activated on 23 February 2021. The CRSP scheme operates on and after 23 February 2021 until 1 month after all areas of New Zealand return to COVID-19 alert level 1. A specified person living, or if a non-natural person registered or otherwise established, in New Zealand is eligible to receive a grant of money under the CRSP scheme if— the person has a minimum 30% decline in revenue in relation to their business or organisation, which is calculated by comparing the following: the revenue received by the person during a 7-day period nominated by the person— in accordance with the eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner; and which period must be during the period starting on or after 15 February 2021 and ending immediately before all areas of New Zealand return to COVID-19 alert level 1: the revenue received by the person during a 7-day period nominated by the person— in accordance with eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner; and which period must be during the comparator period set by the Commissioner that applies to that person’s business or organisation; and the person has been operating the business or organisation in relation to which the revenue is received for a period of at least 6 months before 15 February 2021. An eligible person is eligible for 1 payment only, which is the lesser of the following: $1,500 plus an additional amount of $400 for each full-time equivalent worker employed by the person (up to a maximum of 50 full-time equivalent workers); or 4 times the amount by which the eligible person’s revenue has declined (as calculated in accordance with clause 5 and declared by the person in their application). For the purposes of calculating the number of full-time equivalent workers employed by a person, the number of full-time and part-time workers must be added (applying clause 3(2)) and if that addition produces a fraction it must be rounded up to the nearest whole number. This Order, which comes into force on 23 February 2021 activates the COVID-19 resurgence support payments scheme (the CRSP scheme). Clause 3 sets out definitions used in the order. Clause 4 activates the CRSP scheme and declares it to be in operation until 1 month after all areas of New Zealand return to COVID-19 alert level 1.

In this order, unless the context otherwise requires,— 7-day period  means a period of 7 consecutive days Commissioner means the Commissioner of Inland Revenue CRSP scheme means the COVID-19 resurgence support payments scheme full-time equivalent worker means a person who is an employee and who regularly works 20 or more hours a week part-time equivalent worker means a person who is an employee and who regularly works less than 20 hours per week specified person  means— an individual who is self-employed: a body corporate or an unincorporated body: a registered charity: an incorporated society: a post-settlement governance entity: a trust: a partnership (as defined in sections 8 and 9 of the Partnership Law Act 2019): any department of State or organisation in the State services (as defined in section 5 of the Public Service Act 2020) that is approved by the Minister of Finance as a participant in the CRSP scheme: a non-government organisation: a pre-revenue firm: a joint venture. For the purposes of this order, a part-time equivalent worker must be treated as 0.6 of a full-time equivalent worker. The CRSP scheme, as activated on 23 February 2021 under the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (February 2021) Order 2021, is continued as set out in this order. The CRSP scheme continues until the first working day that is at least 1 month after the relevant date. The relevant date is the first date, on or after 7 March 2021, on which all areas of New Zealand are at COVID-19 alert level 1. A specified person living, or if a non-natural person registered or otherwise established, in New Zealand is eligible to receive a grant of money under the CRSP scheme if— the person has a minimum 30% decline in revenue in relation to their business or organisation, which is calculated by comparing the following: the revenue received by the person during a 7-day period nominated by the person— in accordance with the eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner; and which period must be during the period starting on 15 February 2021 and ending immediately before 11.59 pm on 22 February 2021: the revenue received by the person during a 7-day period nominated by the person— in accordance with eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner; and which period must be during the comparator period set by the Commissioner that applies to that person’s business or organisation; and the person has been operating the business or organisation in relation to which the revenue is received for a period of at least 6 months before 15 February 2021. A specified person living, or if a non-natural person registered or otherwise established, in New Zealand is eligible to receive a grant of money under the CRSP scheme if— the person has a minimum 30% decline in revenue in relation to their business or organisation, which is calculated by comparing the following: the revenue received by the person during a 7-day period nominated by the person— in accordance with the eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner; and which period must be during the period starting on 28 February 2021 and ending immediately before the first date, on or after 7 March 2021, on which all areas of New Zealand return to COVID-19 alert level 1: the revenue received by the person during a 7-day period nominated by the person— in accordance with eligibility criteria set by the Commissioner; and which period must be during the comparator period set by the Commissioner that applies to that person’s business or organisation; and the person has been operating the business or organisation in relation to which the revenue is received for a period of at least 6 months before 28 February 2021. A person eligible to receive a grant of money under clause 5 is eligible for 1 payment only under that clause of an amount calculated under subclauses (4) and (5). A person eligible to receive a grant of money under clause 6 is eligible for 1 payment only under that clause of an amount calculated under subclauses (4) and (5). A person may receive a grant of money under clause 5 and another under clause 6. The amount of each grant is the lesser of the following: $1,500 plus an additional amount of $400 for each full-time equivalent worker employed by the person (up to a maximum of 50 full-time equivalent workers); or 4 times the amount by which the eligible person’s revenue has declined (as calculated in accordance with clause 5 or 6, as the case requires, and declared by the person in their application). For the purposes of calculating the number of full-time equivalent workers employed by a person, the number of full-time and part-time workers must be added together (applying clause 3(2)) and if that addition produces a fraction it must be rounded up to the nearest whole number. The COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (February 2021) Order 2021 (LI 2021/12) is revoked. The transitional, savings, and related provisions set out in the Schedule have effect according to their terms. This clause applies to a person who received a grant of money under the previous order. The person may not receive a grant of money under clause 5. However, the person may receive a grant of money under clause 6. In this clause, previous order means the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (February 2021) Order 2021, as revoked by clause 8. This order, which comes into force on 8 March 2021, continues the COVID-19 resurgence support payments scheme. This order continues to allow eligible persons to receive a grant of money in respect of a loss of revenue over the period from 15 to 22 February 2021 (see clause 5). It also allows eligible persons to receive a grant of money in respect of a loss of revenue over the period from 28 February 2021 until the first date, on or after 7 March 2021, on which all of New Zealand returns to COVID-19 alert level 1 (see clause 6). The order allows eligible persons to receive a grant of money in respect of both the period described in clause 5 and the period described in clause 6. This order revokes and replaces the COVID-19 Resurgence Support Payments Scheme (February 2021) Order 2021 (the previous order). A person who received a grant of money in accordance with the previous order cannot receive another grant of money in accordance with clause 5 of this order. However, a person who made an application under the previous order, but has not yet received a grant of money under that order, is not required to make a new application in order to receive a grant of money under clause 5 of this order.",https://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2021/0033/latest/whole.html
2020-03-31T18:27:58,Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance (Exemptions for COVID-19) Amendment Regulations 2020," These regulations are made under section 138(1)﻿(ab) of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council and on the recommendation of the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs made in accordance with section 138(1A) of that Act. These regulations are the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance (Exemptions for COVID-19) Amendment Regulations 2020. These regulations come into force on 1 April 2020. These regulations amend the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Regulations 2004 (the principal regulations). After regulation 18C, insert: A consumer credit contract is exempt from the application of the provisions of the Act that are listed in subclause (2) if— a registered bank is the creditor or manages the contract in circumstances that relate to securitisation or covered bond arrangements or similar arrangements; and the borrower is experiencing, or reasonably expects to experience, financial difficulties due to the economic or health effects of COVID-19; and  the contract is either— an existing contract that is varied (or proposed to be varied) for the purpose of reducing those difficulties; or  a replacement contract that is entered into (or proposed to be entered into) for the purpose of reducing those difficulties. The provisions of the Act referred to in subclause (1) are as follows:  if an existing contract is being varied, section 9C(2)﻿(a)﻿(iii), but only to the extent that that provision may require the creditor to be satisfied that it is likely that the borrower will continue to make the payments under the agreement without suffering substantial hardship: if the contract is a replacement contract, section 9C(3)﻿(a)﻿(ii) (lenders must make reasonable inquiries, before entering into the agreement with a borrower, so as to be satisfied that it is likely that the borrower will make the payments under the agreement without suffering substantial hardship): sections 17, 22(2) and (4), and 26(3) to the extent of the time limits for making disclosure and giving or sending terms: section 57A(1) (which relates to the obligations of creditors in relation to hardship applications). The exemption from sections 17, 22(2) and (4), and 26(3) is subject to the condition that the registered bank must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, make the disclosure, and give or send the terms, required under the relevant section. The exemption from section 57A(1) is subject to the condition that the registered bank must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after receiving an application for a change to the contract on grounds of unforeseen hardship,— decide whether to agree to change the contract in accordance with the application; and  give the borrower the notice and summary required by section 57A(1)﻿(c)﻿(ii) and (iii) (that is, written notice of the decision and, if the creditor does not agree to change the contract in accordance with the application, written notice setting out the registered bank’s reasons for that decision and a clear summary of the borrower’s rights under section 58 of the Act). In this regulation,— borrower includes any debtor as that term is defined in the Act registered bank has the same meaning as in section 2(1) of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989 replacement contract means a contract (where a registered bank is the creditor or manages the contract in circumstances that relate to securitisation or covered bond arrangements or similar arrangements) with a borrower that replaces (in whole or in part) an existing contract— with the same registered bank; or  that is managed by the same registered bank in any of those circumstances. This regulation applies only to consumer credit contracts entered into or varied on or before the close of 31 October 2020. These regulations, which come into force on 1 April 2020, amend the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Regulations 2004. These regulations provide exemptions from certain requirements of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 where the borrower has been impacted by the effects of COVID-19. The exemptions facilitate the recently announced 6-month mortgage repayment deferral scheme and relief from other household borrowing from registered banks. The exemptions apply if a registered bank is the creditor (or the contract manager, in the case of securitisations, etc) and if the borrower is experiencing, or reasonably expects to experience, financial difficulties due to the economic or health effects of COVID-19. The exemptions facilitate variations of existing contracts, and entry into replacement contracts, for the purpose of reducing those difficulties. The exemptions are from the provisions listed in new regulation 18D(2), and apply subject to the conditions set out in new regulation 18D(3) and (4). The following statement of reasons is published for the purposes of section 138(1B) of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003. The Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, having had regard to the purposes of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003 set out in section 3 of that Act (the Act) as required by section 138(1A)﻿(a) of the Act, and being satisfied as to the matters set out in section 138(1A)﻿(b) and (c)﻿(ii) of the Act, considers the exemptions made in new regulation 18D of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Regulations 2004 to be appropriate because— requiring registered banks offering mortgage and household debt relief to borrowers impacted by the effects of COVID-19 to comply with the timing requirements for disclosure and hardship applications, and to conduct normal affordability assessments for replacement contracts (where these are issued in place of a variation) and in some cases for variations of contracts, would impose unduly onerous and burdensome requirements, given the uncertainty around affected customers’ finances, the volume of applications likely to be received, and the disruptions to bank and postal operations caused by heightened alert levels to address the outbreak of COVID-19; and  exempting those credit contracts from the specified requirements will not cause significant detriment to borrowers because— all other protections and remedies under the Act remain in place in relation to those credit contracts, including the responsible lending principles to ensure borrowers make informed decisions, to exercise the care, diligence, and skill of a responsible lender, and to treat the borrower reasonably and in an ethical manner: the exemptions are limited to timing, procedural and affordability assessment requirements relating to existing contracts on which repayment relief is required, are subject to conditions to protect borrowers, and will be complemented by guidance from the Commerce Commission; and the purposes of the Act to protect the interests of consumers, to promote confident and informed participation of consumers in markets for credit, to promote fair, efficient, and transparent markets for credit, and to provide remedies for consumers in relation to oppressive conduct will continue to be met.

The provisions of the Act referred to in subclause (1) are sections 17, 22(2) and (4), and 26(3) to the extent of the time limits for making disclosure and giving or sending terms.  The exemptions are subject to the condition that the non-bank lender must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, make the disclosure, and give or send the terms, required under the relevant section.

This regulation applies only to consumer credit contracts entered into or varied on or before the close of 31 October 2020. These regulations, which come into force on 13 May 2020, amend the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Regulations 2004.

The exemptions apply if a non-bank lender is the creditor (or the contract manager, in the case of securitisations, etc) and the debtor is experiencing, or reasonably expects to experience, financial difficulties due to the economic or health effects of COVID-19. The exemptions facilitate variations of existing contracts, and entry into replacement contracts, for the purpose of reducing those difficulties. The exemptions do not apply to mobile traders or to high-cost consumer credit contracts. The exemptions are from time limits for making disclosure and giving or sending terms under the provisions of the Act listed in new regulation 18E(2). The exemptions are subject to the condition that the lender must make the disclosure, or give or send the terms, as required by the Act as soon as is reasonably practicable.

These regulations are the Customs and Excise (Refunds and Remissions) Amendment Regulations 2020. These regulations come into force on 29 May 2020. These regulations amend the Customs and Excise Regulations 1996 (the principal regulations).

This regulation and Schedule 3 are revoked on 16 October 2020. Despite subclause (5), this regulation and Schedule 3 continue to have effect for the purpose of determining— any election petition presented to the High Court or Court of Appeal under the Act relating to the general election to be held on 19 September 2020: any petition to the High Court under the Referendums Framework Act 2019 relating to the referendums to be held on 19 September 2020: any recount of votes cast by electors at the general election or the referendums to be held on 19 September 2020. After Schedule 2, insert the Schedule 3 set out in the Schedule of these regulations. These regulations are revoked on 16 October 2021. An application for a special vote may be made— in person by the elector; or by a written application— signed by the elector; or signed on behalf of the elector under an authority signed by the elector; or in any other manner approved by the Electoral Commission (for example, by telephone). Every person who makes a declaration as a special voter under this clause or Part 3 must indicate in the declaration the ground or grounds on which the person is claiming a special vote. A declaration must be in a form approved by the Electoral Commission and witnessed by a qualified witness. A qualified witness is a person who— is authorised to take statutory declarations under the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957; or is registered as an elector of an electoral district; or is approved by a Returning Officer to witness a declaration; or is a relative of the declarant; or is a member of the declarant’s household. However, a declaration that is made by a person as a special voter in New Zealand need not be witnessed if— the declarant is making the declaration in a place other than— a polling place; or a hospital, a maternity home, or an institution referred to in regulation 19(4); or a prison; or a place of isolation or quarantine at which they are required to remain by— an order made under section 11(1) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020; or a medical officer of health under the Health Act 1956; and the declarant has satisfied the Electoral Commission that because of the declarant’s circumstances it is not reasonable to require that their declaration be witnessed by a qualified witness. The vote of an elector voting as a special voter must be exercised— in the manner prescribed by this clause; or in accordance with any arrangements made by the Electoral Commission. If the elector applies in person for a special vote, the Issuing Officer must, after the elector has made the declaration,— place the declaration in the compartment of the envelope marked “Declaration”; and seal that compartment and hand to the elector— the envelope; and a special ballot paper; and any voting papers issued under any enactment. If the elector does not apply in person for a special vote, the elector must, after making the declaration, place the declaration in the compartment of the envelope marked “Declaration”. When the declaration has been dealt with as required by subclause (2) or (3), the elector must then alone and secretly— mark the party vote portion of the ballot paper with a tick within the circle immediately after the name of the party for which the elector wishes to vote; and mark the electorate vote portion of the ballot paper with a tick within the circle immediately before the name of the constituency candidate for whom the elector wishes to vote; and mark any voting paper in accordance with the instructions on that voting paper. The ballot paper and any voting papers must then be placed in the compartment of the envelope marked “BALLOT AND/OR VOTING PAPERS” and the compartment sealed. If an elector exercises a special vote in a polling place, the envelope must be deposited as an Issuing Officer directs either in the ballot box or in a receptacle specially provided for the votes of special voters, and every envelope is deemed to have been received by the Issuing Officer for that polling place at the time it was deposited. If any elector exercises a special vote other than in a polling place, the elector may arrange for the envelope to be delivered to a Returning Officer or an Issuing Officer— by hand; or by post. An envelope delivered by hand under subclause (7)﻿(a) must be received before the close of the poll. An envelope delivered by post under subclause (7)﻿(b) must be received— on or before polling day; or no later than noon on the fourth day following polling day if postmarked or date-stamped by any New Zealand Post outlet or agency before polling day. An elector may vote in accordance with subclause (11) or (12) if the elector— is wholly or partially blind; or is unable to read or write; or has severe difficulty in reading or writing; or is not sufficiently familiar with the English language to vote without assistance. If an elector to whom subclause (10) applies votes at a polling place, section 170 of the Act applies with any necessary modifications. If an elector to whom subclause (10) applies does not vote at a polling place, the person who witnessed the elector’s declaration must or, if the elector’s declaration was not required to be witnessed, any person who is qualified to witness a declaration may— assist the elector to mark the ballot paper and any voting papers; or mark the ballot paper and any voting papers as instructed by the elector. If the words “Not qualified” are shown on a declaration, the Returning Officer must disallow the vote of the elector named in the declaration form. If the words “Party vote qualified” are shown on a declaration, the Returning Officer must allow the party vote, but disallow the electorate vote, of the elector named in the declaration form unless the Returning Officer is required to disallow the party vote in accordance with subclause (4), (5), or (6). If the word “Qualified” is shown on a declaration, the Returning Officer must allow the vote of the elector named in the declaration form unless the Returning Officer is required to disallow the vote in accordance with subclause (4), (5), or (6). If a declaration referred to in subclause (2) or (3) does not indicate the ground or grounds on which a special vote is claimed, the Returning Officer must disallow the vote of the elector named in the declaration form, unless— the elector’s name does not appear on the main roll or any supplementary roll for the district or has been wrongly deleted from any such roll; or the official mark of the Issuing Officer witnessing the declaration and the date shown on the declaration indicate that the declaration was made on polling day outside the electoral district. If a declaration referred to in subclause (2) or (3) is not signed by the elector named in the declaration form, the Returning Officer must disallow the vote of the elector. If the declaration referred to in subclause (2) or (3) is required to be witnessed but the declaration form has not been signed by a person who is qualified to witness a declaration, the Returning Officer must disallow the vote unless satisfied that the declaration was made in the presence of a qualified witness. If the Returning Officer disallows a vote under this clause, the Returning Officer must endorse on the envelope and on the declaration form the words “Disallowed, not qualified”, or on the declaration the words “Disallowed, declaration not in order”. The Returning Officer must not disallow the vote of an elector on the ground that the elector has failed to show their date of birth or former names in a declaration (being a declaration of the kind referred to in subclause (3)). These regulations, which come into force on 31 July 2020, amend the Electoral Regulations 1996 (the principal regulations). To support the anticipated increase in the number of persons voting at this year’s general election as special voters due to the effects of COVID-19, and make the process easier for these voters, these regulations make changes to the requirements in the principal regulations. The changes are to regulations 20, 25, 26, 27, and 37 of the principal regulations. Those provisions are temporarily suspended and replaced with new provisions that— allow an application for a special vote to be made in any manner approved by the Electoral Commission (for example, by telephone): remove for special voters in New Zealand who are not in a managed facility the requirement to have their declaration witnessed if they satisfy the Electoral Commission that in their circumstances it is an unreasonable requirement: remove the ability of candidates to nominate persons who may witness special vote declarations: provide that a special vote returned by post in an envelope that is not postmarked or date-stamped is valid if it is received by a Returning Officer or an Issuing Officer on or before polling day. The new provisions apply only during the period 31 July 2020 to 16 October 2020. They are revoked on 16 October 2020, after the return of the writ for the general election, although they will continue to apply for the purpose of determining any petition or recount relating to the general election or referendums to be held on 19 September 2020.

Schedule 3 of the principal regulations sets out temporary provisions that suspend and replace specified regulations for the purposes of this year’s general election and the referendums that are to be held concurrently. The temporary provisions are to support the anticipated increase in the number of special voters due to the effects of COVID-19. Regulation 42A of the principal regulations currently applies the temporary provisions in Schedule 3 until 15 October 2020. The dates in regulation 42A need to be changed to reflect that this year’s general election is now to be held on 17 October and to provide that the application of the temporary provisions extends to the day on which the writ for the 2020 general election is returned by the Electoral Commission. These regulations are revoked on 16 October 2021, the same day as the Electoral Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2020.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0227/latest/whole.html

2020-08-27T12:17:53,Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19—Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017—Term of Appointments to Te Pou Tupua) Immediate Modification Order 2020," This order is made under section 15 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006— on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council; and on the recommendation of the Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti made after being satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of that Act and after receiving from the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice a written recommendation stating the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(a) of that Act. This order is the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19—Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017—Term of Appointments to Te Pou Tupua) Immediate Modification Order 2020. This order comes into force on 28 August 2020. This order modifies a restriction imposed by the Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017 (the Act). Clause 1 of Schedule 3 of the Act has effect as if the following were inserted after clause 1(1) of that schedule: However, the term of the first persons appointed to Te Pou Tupua ends at the close of 3 June 2021. This order is revoked on 10 June 2021. This note is not part of the order, but is intended to indicate its general effect. This order is made under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006. It comes into force on 28 August 2020 and is revoked on 10 June 2021. It modifies a restriction imposed by the Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017 (the Act) that may be impossible or impracticable to comply with during an epidemic. Clause 1 states the Title of the order. Clause 2 states that the order comes into force on 28 August 2020. Clause 3 states that the order modifies a restriction imposed by the Act. Clause 4 modifies the term of appointment for the first appointees to Te Pou Tupua so that the term ends on 3 June 2021. The effect of the modification is that those appointees are appointed for 3 years and 9 months, instead of the usual 3 years. The Minister for Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti is satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 for the reasons that follow. Te Pou Tupua is the legal representative of Te Awa Tupua, which is the legal person comprising the Whanganui River recognised under the Act. It is important for Te Pou Tupua to continue to make decisions as the legal representative of Te Awa Tupua. The term of office of the existing appointees (who are the first appointees) to Te Pou Tupua ends on 3 September 2020. There is no provision in the Act that enables the present members of Te Pou Tupua to continue to act beyond 3 September 2020. The nomination and joint appointment process for Te Pou Tupua, which involves the Crown and the 8 iwi with interests in the Whanganui River, requires approximately 6 months to complete. It is impossible for the Crown and iwi to nominate and jointly appoint Te Pou Tupua before the term of the existing appointees ends on 3 September 2020. The effects of COVID-19 meant that initial meetings were not held and the iwi and the Crown could not get their internal processes underway in March 2020. Hui were not possible during the period when contact with others and travel were restricted. In addition, both the Crown and iwi were focused on more immediate priorities relating to the COVID-19 response, with few, if any, resources to commit to the nomination and appointment process for Te Pou Tupua. The modification is a narrow modification to the Act to address this specific situation by providing for the first appointees to have a term of 3 years and 9 months, instead of 3 years. A 9-month extension is considered reasonable and appropriate to allow for both the general election (which ensures that a government is formed and a Minister warranted) and a subsequent 6-month process for appointment. This time frame has been confirmed with Ngā Tāngata Tiaki o Whanganui (on behalf of Whanganui Iwi) and is supported by the other 7 iwi with interests in the Whanganui River who are involved in the nomination and appointment process.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0225/latest/whole.html

Clause 15(2) of Schedule 8 of the Act provides that an Authority may only accept such an application if it is made within the time specified in the section of the Act under which the appeal is to be made. Clause 4 modifies clause 15(2) of Schedule 8 so that an Authority may accept an application for an extension of time if it is made no later than 20 working days after the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 (the Epidemic Notice) expires or is revoked.

2021-03-18T19:49:44,Epidemic Preparedness (Employment Relations Act 2000—Collective Bargaining) Immediate Modification Order 2020," This order is made under section 15 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006— on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council; and on the recommendation of the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety made after being satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of that Act and after receiving from the chief executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation, and Employment a written recommendation stating the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(a) of that Act. This order is the Epidemic Preparedness (Employment Relations Act 2000—Collective Bargaining) Immediate Modification Order 2020. This order comes into force on 16 April 2020. This order modifies requirements imposed by the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the Act). This clause applies to an employer who initiates bargaining or receives a notice initiating bargaining for a collective agreement while the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 (the Epidemic Notice) is in force. Section 43(2)﻿(b)﻿(i) of the Act has effect as if the 10-day period excludes any days during which the Epidemic Notice is in force. Section 43(2)﻿(b)﻿(ii) of the Act has effect as if the 15-day period excludes any days during which the Epidemic Notice is in force. This clause applies to an employer who receives  2 or more notices under section 42 of the Act from different unions that relate, in whole or in part, to the same type of work if the period specified in section 50(2) of the Act expires— while the Epidemic Notice is in force; or within 40 days after the date on which the Epidemic Notice expires or is revoked. Section 50(2) of the Act has effect as if the 40-day period excludes any days during which the Epidemic Notice is in force. This clause applies to a union who receives a request under section 50(2) of the Act if the period specified in section 50(3) of the Act expires— while the Epidemic Notice is in force; or within 30 days after the date on which the Epidemic Notice expires or is revoked. Section 50(3) of the Act has effect as if the 30-day period excludes any days during which the Epidemic Notice is in force. This clause applies— while the Epidemic Notice is in force; and to the extent that a ratification procedure notified under section 51(2) of the Act requires a union to ratify a collective agreement or variation by post or in person. Despite section 51 of the Act, a union may— notify the other intended party or parties to the agreement or variation of a new ratification procedure on or after the commencement of this order; and  ratify the collective agreement or variation in accordance with the new ratification procedure. This clause applies to a collective agreement if the period specified in section 53(3) of the Act expires— while the Epidemic Notice is in force; or within 3 months after the date on which the Epidemic Notice expires or is revoked. Section 53(3) of the Act has effect as if the period excludes any days during which the Epidemic Notice is in force. This order is revoked immediately after the expiry of the 3-month period that starts on the date on which the Epidemic Notice expires or is revoked. This note is not part of the order, but is intended to indicate its general effect. This order is made under section 15 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 and its effect is temporary. It comes into force on 16 April 2020 and is revoked 3 months after the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 (the Epidemic Notice) expires or is revoked. It modifies restrictions and requirements imposed by the Employment Relations Act 2000 (the Act) that may be impossible or impracticable to comply with during an epidemic. Clause 1 states the Title of the order. Clause 2 states that the order comes into force on 16 April 2020. Clause 3 states that the order modifies requirements imposed by the Act. Clause 4 modifies a requirement of section 43 of the Act, which provides that an employer that initiates bargaining or that receives a notice initiating bargaining for a collective agreement must draw the existence and coverage of the bargaining, and the intended parties, to the attention of all employees whose work would be covered by the intended coverage clause. It must do so as soon as possible and no later than— 10 days after bargaining is initiated, if only 1 employer is identified as an intended party to the bargaining; or 15 days after bargaining is initiated, if 2 or more employers are identified as intended parties to the bargaining. Clause 4 modifies this requirement so that the period within which an employer must comply with section 43(1) is extended by the number of days during which the Epidemic Notice is in force. Clause 5 modifies a requirement of section 50(2) of the Act, which provides that an employer who receives 2 or more notices under section 42 from different unions that relate to the same type of work may, within 40 days after receiving the first notice, request each union concerned to consolidate the bargaining initiated by each notice into bargaining for a single collective agreement. Clause 5 modifies this requirement so that the period within which an employer may make the request is extended by the number of days during which the Epidemic Notice is in force. Clause 6 modifies a requirement of section 50(3) of the Act, which provides that a union that receives a request under section 50(2) of the Act must, within 30 days after receiving the request— agree to the request; or withdraw the notice given under section 42. Clause 6 modifies this requirement so that the period within which the union must agree to the request or withdraw the notice is extended by the number of days during which the Epidemic Notice is in force. Clause 7 modifies a requirement of section 51 of the Act, which provides that a union must not sign a collective agreement or a variation of the collective agreement unless the agreement or variation has been ratified in accordance with a ratification procedure notified by the union at the beginning of bargaining for the collective agreement or the variation. Clause 7 modifies this requirement by allowing a union to ratify a collective agreement or variation in accordance with a new ratification procedure notified by the union to the other intended party or parties to the agreement or variation on or after the commencement of this order— while the Epidemic Notice is in force; and if the ratification procedure notified at the beginning of bargaining required the union to ratify the collective agreement by post or in person. Clause 8 modifies a requirement of section 53 of the Act, which provides that a collective agreement that would otherwise expire as provided in section 52(3) of the Act continues in force for a period not exceeding 12 months if— the union or the employer initiated collective bargaining before the collective agreement expired and for the purpose of replacing the collective agreement; and bargaining continues for a collective agreement to replace the collective agreement that has expired. Clause 8 modifies this requirement so that the maximum 12-month period during which the collective agreement may continue in force is extended by the number of days during which the Epidemic Notice is in force. Clause 9 provides that the order is revoked 3 months after the Epidemic Notice expires or is revoked. The Minister of Workplace Relations and Safety is satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 for the reasons that follow. When collective bargaining has been initiated, the Employment Relations Act 2000 requires parties to that bargaining to take certain actions within specific time frames. Some of those time frames are impracticable while the Epidemic Notice is in place, as both employers and unions face significant disruption due to the closure of some workplaces and the requirements to work from home. The Employment Relations Act 2000 requires that where an employer receives 2 or more notices of initiation of bargaining from different unions for work of the same type within its workplace, the employer may request that bargaining is consolidated within a 40-day period. The union has a corresponding obligation to respond within 30 days to the consolidation request. During the period in which the Epidemic Notice is in place, parties may not be able to carry out normal processes and may find it hard to get in contact with their members due to inability via technological means, or inability to contact those people due to sickness. The Employment Relations Act 2000 also requires that a union must ratify a collective agreement in accordance with procedures notified to the other party at the beginning of bargaining. This may be impracticable because many unions hold an in-person meeting to vote on ratification of the collective agreement. Such meetings are impossible during lockdown and inadvisable for public health reasons during the epidemic. The Employment Relations Act 2000 enables expired collective agreements to continue in force, where bargaining has been initiated, for up to 12 months to enable parties to bargain and ratify a new collective agreement to replace the expired agreement. Due to the restrictions in place unions are unable to arrange meetings with their members in person, and not all members may have access to electronic means in which to communicate. In some cases, employers and unions will be focused on immediate priorities relating to the COVID-19 response, meaning resources are unavailable for bargaining during this period.   It will be impractical or impossible for some employers or unions to conclude collective bargaining and ratify a collective agreement while the Epidemic Notice is in place. This may mean that some collective agreements expire, despite a willingness to conclude negotiations and ratify an agreement. Immediate modifications are required to the Employment Relations Act 2000 to enable parties to comply with their obligations and not disadvantage parties by the inability to bargain during this time. Specifically, the changes— modify the maximum time frames by which an employer must notify their employees who are in work and covered by collective bargaining that bargaining has been initiated, to exclude the duration of the Epidemic Notice; and modify the maximum time frames by which an employer must seek to consolidate collective bargaining (40 days), and for unions to respond to an attempted consolidation (30 days), to exclude the duration of the Epidemic Notice; and in the case of collective agreements which would otherwise have expired, but are still in force for 12 months after expiry, modify the 12-month period to exclude any period covered by the Epidemic Notice if the 12-month period would otherwise end while the Epidemic Notice is in force or up to 3 months after it expires or is revoked; and allow the union to notify the other intended party or parties to a collective agreement of a new ratification procedure to ratify the collective agreement (eg, online balloting, videoconferencing or teleconferencing) if a union has committed at the outset of collective bargaining to a ratification procedure that is no longer practicable (eg, in-person ratification meetings).",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0061/latest/whole.html
2021-03-17T17:02:20,Epidemic Preparedness (Local Government Act 2002) Immediate Modification Order 2020," This order is made under section 15 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006— on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council; and on the recommendation of the Minister of Local Government made after being satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of that Act and on a written recommendation from the chief executive of the Department of Internal Affairs stating the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(a). This order is the Epidemic Preparedness (Local Government Act 2002) Immediate Modification Order 2020. This order comes into force on 10 April 2020. This order modifies requirements imposed by the Local Government Act 2002 (the Act). The modifications set out in this clause apply to a person who makes the declaration required by clause 14(1)﻿(a) of Schedule 7 of the Act— on or after 10 April 2020; and while the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 is in force. Clause 14(1)﻿(b) of Schedule 7 of the Act does not apply. Clause 14(2) and (3) of Schedule 7 of the Act applies as if it were replaced with: As soon as is reasonably practicable after the meeting at which the person makes their oral declaration, the person must— sign a written version of the declaration; and provide a copy of that signed version to the chief executive of the local authority (for example, by emailing a scanned copy). The form of the declaration must consist of the following elements: A failure to comply with subclause (2) does not affect the person’s ability to act as a member. This order is revoked when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. This note is not part of the order, but is intended to indicate its general effect. This order is made under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 and its effect is temporary. It comes into force on 10 April 2020 and is revoked when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. It modifies requirements imposed by the Local Government Act 2002 (the Act) that may be impossible or impracticable to comply with during an epidemic. Clause 1 states the Title of the order. Clause 2 states that the order comes into force on 10 April 2020. Clause 3 states that the order modifies requirements imposed by the Act. Clause 4  modifies clause 14 of Schedule 7 of the Act, which prohibits a person from acting as a member of a local authority until— they have made an oral declaration in the required form at a meeting of the local authority; and a written version of the declaration has been attested in the required way (which involves the declaration being signed by the member and witnessed by the chairperson, mayor, or another member of the local authority or by the chief executive or another officer of the local authority). Clause 4 modifies those requirements so that the person may act as a member of the local authority once they have made their oral declaration. The person must then sign a written version of the declaration and provide a copy to the chief executive of the local authority. The signing does not need to be witnessed. Clause 5 provides that the order is revoked when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. The Minister of Local Government is satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 for the reasons that follow. The New Zealand Influenza Pandemic Plan: A framework for action identifies the roles and responsibilities of local authorities in the response phase as being to provide local leadership, maintain essential local government services, provide a local Civil Defence Emergency Management (CDEM) response to pandemic influenza, and support the activities of their CDEM Group to address the community consequences of pandemic influenza. Several members elected at recent by-elections have yet to make their declarations, a number of by-elections are currently underway, and further by-elections may be required. The COVID-19 Response (Urgent Management Measures) Legislation Act 2020 amended the Local Government Act 2002 to allow local authority meetings to be conducted wholly by audio or video conferencing while the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 is in force. Most local authority meetings over this period will be conducted by audio, rather than video, conferencing. It is not possible for the signing of the written declaration to be witnessed by another participant in a meeting conducted by audio conference. This modification is necessary to enable new local authority members to make the declaration and assume their role as members while the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 is in force.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0060/latest/whole.html

This order modifies requirements imposed by the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957 (the Act). To the extent that Part 1 of the Act requires an oath to be sworn, or an affirmation to be made, in the presence of the person administering the oath or affirmation (the administrator),— that requirement is waived; and Part 1 has effect as if the administrator may instead administer the oath or affirmation using an audiovisual or audio link with the person swearing or making the oath or affirmation (subject to subclause (2)). If the oath or affirmation is, or is required to be evidenced, in writing,— the administrator must be satisfied that the person swearing or making the oath or affirmation signed the document concerned in the course of the audiovisual or audio link; and as soon as practicable after signing the document, the person must send the signed document (or a photograph or scan of the signed document) to the administrator for the signature of the administrator. In this clause,— administer an oath or affirmation includes take a declaration affirmation includes a declaration. Section 9(1) of the Act (including as modified by clause 4) has effect as if the following paragraph were inserted after section 9(1)﻿(j): any officer or employee of an entity who is authorised for that purpose by or on behalf of the entity, but only if an enactment authorises or requires the declaration to be provided to the entity. Section 9 of the Act is modified as if it were amended by inserting after section 9(2): In this section, entity means any of the following: an individual: a company or other body corporate: a corporation sole: an unincorporated body (including a partnership). This order is revoked when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. This note is not part of the order, but is intended to indicate its general effect. This order is made under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 and its effect is temporary. It comes into force on 17 April 2020 and is revoked when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. It modifies requirements imposed by the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957 (the Act) that may be impossible or impracticable to comply with during an epidemic. The modifications expressly allow an oath, an affirmation, or a declaration to be administered or taken using an audiovisual or audio link instead of in the presence of the person swearing the oath or making the affirmation or declaration. The modifications also enable a declaration to be taken by any officer or employee of an entity who is authorised by the entity, but only if an enactment authorises or requires the declaration to be provided to the entity. Statement of reasons The Minister of Justice is satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 for the reasons that follow. Effects are, or are likely to be, such that the requirement is impossible or impracticable to comply (or comply fully) with It is important that people are able to make oaths, affirmations, and declarations while the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 is in force.  While the lock-down period is in force, it would be “impossible” or “impracticable” for most people to arrange for their oath, affirmation, or declaration to be administered or witnessed in person due to the isolation requirements.  This applies to not only those made in New Zealand but also to those made overseas and needing to be recognised in New Zealand. Moreover, even if a lower alert level applies, it is likely to be important for vulnerable people to remain isolated. Modifications go no further than reasonably necessary The modifications are limited to modifying requirements of Part 1 of the Act for administering or taking oaths, affirmations, or declarations and are temporary (they end when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked). In particular, the modifications enable— an oath, a affirmation, or a declaration to be administered or taken using an audiovisual or audio link instead of in the presence of the person swearing the oath or making the affirmation or declaration; and a declaration to be taken by any officer or employee of an entity who is authorised by the entity, but only if an enactment authorises or requires the declaration to be provided to the entity. Some people wishing to make oaths, affirmations, or declarations will not have access to digital devices or smart phones. For that reason, it is no more than reasonably necessary to enable them to be administered or taken by phone or other audio link as well as audiovisual link.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0063/latest/whole.html
2021-03-18T17:00:31,Epidemic Preparedness (Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988—Enduring Powers of Attorney) Immediate Modification Order 2020," This order is made under section 15 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006— on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council; and on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, made after being satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of that Act and after receiving from the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice a written recommendation stating the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(a) of that Act. This order is the Epidemic Preparedness (Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988—Enduring Powers of Attorney) Immediate Modification Order 2020. This order comes into force on 24 April 2020. This order modifies requirements imposed by the following enactments: the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 (the Act); and the Protection of Personal and Property Rights (Enduring Powers of Attorney Forms and Prescribed Information) Regulations 2008 (the Regulations). This clause has effect despite anything to the contrary in section 94A of the Act or in the relevant prescribed forms. Any alteration may be made to a relevant prescribed form that is consistent with the modifications made by this clause. Any such alteration is to be treated as insubstantial and immaterial for the purposes of section 95(2) of the Act. Signatories to an EPA may sign separate copies of the document concerned instead of the same physical document to enable signing at more than 1 place. If separate copies are signed,— each document must clearly state that it is signed in accordance with this order; and each signed document, or a photograph or scan of the signed document, must be sent or delivered to the holder of the instrument creating the EPA (unless the signatory is the holder); and the full set of documents held by the holder (whether sent and held in hard copy or as photographs or scans) is to be treated as comprising the complete instrument. Despite section 94A(2)﻿(a) and (3)﻿(a) of the Act,— the document concerned may be signed, at the direction of the donor, by some other person in front of the donor by audiovisual link from another place; and if it is signed in front of the donor by audiovisual link, the person must make it clear on the document that it is signed in that way in accordance with this order. To the extent that section 94A (including section 94A(2)﻿(a)) of the Act requires the signature of a party to an EPA to be witnessed by a person in the presence of the party,— the person may instead witness the signature of the party by audiovisual link from another place; and if it is witnessed in that way, the witness must make it clear on the copy signed by the witness that it is witnessed in that way in accordance with this order. Despite section 94A(2)﻿(b) of the Act, if the donor’s signature was witnessed by audiovisual link from another place,— the certificate referred to in section 94A(7) of the Act may be a scan or photograph of the certificate; and the certificate is not required to be attached to the instrument creating the EPA so long as the scan or photograph can be provided along with the instrument. In this clause,— EPA means an enduring power of attorney holder, in relation to an instrument creating an EPA, means the person identified by the donor as the holder of the instrument for the purposes of this clause party to an EPA means— the donor, including a person signing the instrument creating the EPA at the donor’s direction under section 94A(3)﻿(a) of the Act; or the attorney relevant prescribed form means whichever of the following forms prescribed in the Schedule of the Regulations is relevant: form 1 (enduring power of attorney (EPA) in relation to property): form 3 (enduring power of attorney (EPA) in relation to personal care and welfare): form 5 (certificate of witness to donor’s signature on enduring power of attorney (EPA)) signatory to an EPA means— a party to an EPA; or a person who is a witness to the signature of a party to an EPA. This order is revoked when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. This order is made under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 and its effect is temporary. It comes into force on 24 April 2020 and is revoked when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. It modifies requirements imposed by the following enactments that may be impossible or impracticable to comply with during an epidemic: the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988: the Protection of Personal and Property Rights (Enduring Powers of Attorney Forms and Prescribed Information) Regulations 2008. The modifications ensure that an enduring power of attorney (an EPA) can be created when the signatories (the donor, the attorney and witnesses) are in different places. In particular, the modifications— allow the signatories to sign separate copies of the same document, rather than a single physical document; and treat the full set of signed documents that are sent to a holder (which may include photographs or scans) as comprising the complete instrument creating the EPA; and enable audiovisual links to be used instead of requiring a person signing at the direction of the donor, or a person witnessing a donor’s or an attorney’s signature, to do that in the presence of the relevant party (the donor or attorney). Statement of reasons The Minister of Justice is satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 for the reasons that follow. Effects are, or are likely to be, such that the requirement is impossible or impracticable to comply (or comply fully) with It is important that EPAs are able to be created while the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 is in force. During a lockdown period, it is impossible or impracticable (that is to say, practically impossible) for donors, attorneys, and witnesses to sign and witness the same physical copy of the document creating an EPA, and to do those things in person. Further, the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 requires at least 4 people (the donor, the attorney, and 2 witnesses) to be involved in creating an EPA, and for the witnesses to be independent. In particular, the witness to the donor’s signature must be independent of the attorney, and the witness to the attorney’s signature cannot be the donor or the donor’s witness. Even if a lower alert level applies, it is likely to be important for vulnerable people to remain isolated.  Modifications go no further than reasonably necessary The modifications are— limited to modifying requirements, generally set out in section 94A of the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988, for signing and witnessing signatures in documents creating EPAs; and temporary (they end when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked).

2021-03-18T19:37:06,Epidemic Preparedness (Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012—Licence Application Inquiries) Immediate Modification Order 2020," This order is made under section 15 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006— on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council; and on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice made after being satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of that Act and after receiving from the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice a written recommendation stating the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(a) of that Act. This order is the Epidemic Preparedness (Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012—Licence Application Inquiries) Immediate Modification Order 2020. This order comes into force on the day after the date of its notification in the Gazette. This order modifies requirements imposed by the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 (the Act). In this order, unless the context otherwise requires,— end date means the date on which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked licence means a licence to which subpart 3 of Part 2 of the Act applies. The modifications in clauses 6 and 7 apply to a licence application— sent to a constable or a Medical Officer of Health by the secretary under section 103; and received by the constable or Medical Officer of Health while the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 is in force. Section 103(3) and (4) of the Act applies as if it were replaced with: The Police and the Medical Officer of Health— must each inquire into the application; and if either has any matters in opposition to it, must file with the licensing committee a report on it within 30 working days after the end date. The licensing committee may decide an application for a licence only if it has received— a report from the Police; and a report from the Medical Officer of Health. Section 129 of the Act applies as if it were replaced with: The obligations of the secretary, Police, Medical Officer of Health, and inspector set out in section 103 as modified by the Epidemic Preparedness (Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012—Licence Application Inquiries) Immediate Modification Order 2020 apply to an application for a renewal of a licence. The modifications in clauses 6 and 7 apply from the date on which this order comes into force until the date on which the order is revoked. This order is revoked 30 working days after the end date. This note is not part of the order, but is intended to indicate its general effect. This order is made under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 and its effect is temporary. It comes into force on the day after the date of its notification in the Gazette. The order is revoked 30 working days after the date on which the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked (the end date). It modifies restrictions and requirements imposed by the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 (the Act) that may be impossible or impracticable to comply with during an epidemic. The alcohol licensing regime is a devolved system. There are 67 individual district licensing committees (DLCs) that are responsible for determining licence applications in their district. DLCs are administered by local councils.  Section 103 of the Act requires the Police, a Medical Officer of Health, and an inspector to inquire into new alcohol licence applications. That obligation also applies to applications to renew alcohol licences under section 129 of the Act. Under section 103(3) and (4) of the Act, the Police and the Medical Officer of Health must, if they have any matters in opposition to the application, file a report with the DLC within 15 working days. If no report is received, the DLC may assume that neither the Police nor the Medical Officer of Health oppose the application. The Police and health services are essential services and are a key part of leading the country’s response to the COVID-19 epidemic. The effects of COVID-19 mean that the resources of the Police and Medical Officers of Health are reprioritised to focus on the epidemic and it is likely to be impossible for these agencies to deploy sufficient resources to meet their statutory obligations under section 103 of the Act. In addition to resource implications, the Police and Medical Officers of Health are unable to visit premises, which is often part of the inquiry, as most premises are currently closed. The policy intent of these provisions is to temporarily relieve the Police and Medical Officers of Health from those obligations while responding to the epidemic and its impact. The changes also ensure that licence applications and renewals  are scrutinised by the Police and Medical Officers of Health but under a longer time frame than normal, to allow DLCs to make a decision based on all the available evidence. The provisions have retrospective effect on licence applications that, on the commencement of this order, had not been decided by a DLC. This reflects the fact that the obligations became essentially impossible for Police and Medical Officers of Health to perform from 25 March 2020, and therefore retrospective application is a part of fulfilling the policy intention of the provisions.  The impact of retrospectivity on applicants is likely to be marginal. It is unlikely that DLCs had sent many applications to Police and Medical Officers of Health after the time of the notice. The review of applications by Police and Medical Officers of Health is only one part of the licensing process that may not be able to progress as normal during the response to the COVID-19 epidemic.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0064/latest/whole.html

This order makes modifications to a requirement imposed by the Social Security Act 2018 (the principal Act). Section 96(1)﻿(c) has effect as if an applicant to whom this clause applies meets the criteria and requirements in regulation 61 of the Social Security Regulations 2018. This clause applies to an applicant for temporary additional support only if that support was granted before, and the prescribed period of support for that support ends (under regulation 67(1)﻿(a) or (b) of those regulations) on or after, 30 March 2020. This clause does not apply if, during that period, the applicant notifies MSD that the applicant does not wish to receive temporary additional support for another prescribed period of support. This clause also does not apply if, during that period, the applicant (as required by section 113) notifies MSD of a change in the applicant’s circumstances that leads MSD to consider that— the deficiency will reduce to nil; or the applicant will for any reason be ineligible for temporary additional support; or temporary additional support will for any reason not be payable to the applicant. This note is not part of the order, but is intended to indicate its general effect. This order, which comes into force on 30 March 2020, makes a modification to a requirement imposed by the Social Security Act 2018 (the Act) that may be impossible or impracticable to comply with during an epidemic. Clause 4 modifies the requirement in section 96(1)﻿(c) of the Act that, before a person (P) is entitled to temporary additional support, P must meet criteria and requirements in the Social Security Regulations 2018. Those criteria and requirements include (regulation 61) that temporary additional support may be granted to an applicant for that support only if an application form is completed in writing by or on behalf of the applicant, and sets out the information required to allow— the applicant’s eligibility for temporary additional support to be assessed; and the rate of any temporary additional support payable to the applicant to be determined. Clause 4 provides that section 96(1)﻿(c) has effect as if an applicant to whom clause 4 applies meets the criteria and requirements in regulation 61 of the Social Security Regulations 2018. Clause 4 applies to an applicant for temporary additional support only if that support was granted before, and the prescribed period of support for that support ends (under regulation 67(1)﻿(a) or (b) of those regulations) on or after, 30 March 2020. Clause 4 does not apply if, during that period, the applicant notifies MSD that the applicant does not wish to receive temporary additional support for another prescribed period of support. Clause 4 also does not apply if, during that period, the applicant (as required by section 113 of the Act) notifies MSD of a change in the applicant’s circumstances that leads MSD to consider that— the deficiency will reduce to nil; or the applicant will for any reason be ineligible for temporary additional support; or temporary additional support will for any reason not be payable to the applicant.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0052/latest/whole.html

This order is the Epidemic Preparedness (Wills Act 2007—Signing and Witnessing of Wills) Immediate Modification Order 2020. This order comes into force on 17 April 2020. This order modifies requirements imposed by the Wills Act 2007 (the Act).

This order is made under the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 and its effect is temporary. It comes into force on 17 April 2020 and is revoked when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked. It modifies requirements imposed by section 11 of the Wills Act 2007 (the Act) that may be impossible or impracticable to comply with during an epidemic. The modifications allow wills to be signed and witnessed using audiovisual links. Clause 4(1) modifies section 11(3) of the Act so that the will-maker must sign the document or direct another person to sign the document on his or her behalf in his or her presence, or (a modification) direct another person to— sign a copy of the document on his or her behalf before him or her via an audiovisual link from another place because an epidemic notice is in force; and make clear on the copy it is signed in that way; and send a photograph or scan of the signed copy promptly to 1 holder, who is identified by him or her, of— the document; and all required photographs or scans of signed copies of it. Clause 4(2) modifies section 11(4) of the Act so that, when the will-maker complies with, or acknowledges compliance earlier with, section 11(3) of the Act (as modified), at least 2 witnesses must be together in the will-maker’s presence, or (a modification) be together with the will-maker and the other witnesses— in the will-maker’s presence; or via an audiovisual link from 1 or more other places because an epidemic notice is in force.

Clause 4(3) modifies section 11(5) of the Act in light of modifications made by clause 4(1) and (2). Clause 4(4) modifies section 11(6) of the Act in light of modifications made by clause 4(1), (2), and (3). The Minister of Justice is satisfied of the matters required by section 15(2)﻿(b) of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006 for the reasons that follow. It is important that people are able to make a will while the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 is in force. During a lockdown period, people who live with other adults may be able to sign a will in the physical presence of 2 witnesses (for example, if no disposition in the will to or through a witness will be void under section 13 of the Wills Act 2007). However, people who live alone, or with 1 other adult, will not be able to do so. For those people, it is “impossible” or “impracticable” (that is to say, practically impossible) to sign a will in the physical presence of 2 witnesses. Moreover, even if a lower alert level applies, it is likely to be important for vulnerable people to remain isolated. The modifications are— limited to modifying requirements, set out in section 11 of the Wills Act 2007, for signing and witnessing of wills; and temporary (they end when the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 expires or is revoked).",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0065/latest/whole.html

After rule 127, insert: Despite rule 127, if during an emergency personal service of a document is effected by electronic transmission under rule 107A, service of the document is treated as being effected on the recipient at the time the document was sent, and in proving service it is sufficient to prove that— the document was properly addressed to the recipient’s electronic address; and at the time of service, the recipient regularly used that electronic address; and the document was sent to that address. After rule 162, insert: This rule applies despite rule 168. An affidavit that does not comply with rule 158(1)﻿(c) or 159(1)﻿(c) may be filed in proceedings during an emergency if— compliance with those rules during the emergency would— cause an unacceptable delay in the determination of the proceedings having regard to the nature and urgency of the proceedings; or  endanger the health or wellbeing of any person; and the affidavit includes a statement by the person making the affidavit (the deponent) that the matters stated in the affidavit are to the best of their knowledge true and correct. However, an affidavit filed under subclause (2) may only be read and used in proceedings if— a Judge is satisfied as to either of the matters in subclause (2)﻿(a); and the affidavit includes a statement referred to in subclause (2)﻿(b). If the deponent is represented by a lawyer, the lawyer must, when filing the affidavit, file a memorandum— that confirms— the affidavit is the same as the affidavit the deponent would have signed had there not been an emergency; and the lawyer has advised the deponent that they must sign and file the affidavit as soon as circumstances reasonably permit; and that includes an undertaking that, as soon as circumstances reasonably permit,— the deponent will sign the affidavit; and the affidavit will then be filed. If the deponent is not represented by a lawyer, the affidavit must state at the end that the deponent will sign and file the affidavit as soon as circumstances reasonably permit. In this rule, proceedings includes interlocutory proceedings. After rule 198(3), insert: In the event that there is an emergency in the area in which a court office is situated and a judgment given in that office is to be transmitted electronically, a Registrar of the office, or any other office, may seal the judgment electronically if the electronic seal— adequately identifies the Registrar; and is as reliable as is appropriate given the purpose for which, and the circumstances in which, the seal is required. Replace rule 416C(4) with: There are 5 kinds of conferences. Except as provided in rule 416U(2) (which is subject to rule 416U(6)), none of the conferences are mandatory. No more than 1 of each kind of conference should normally be convened in the course of proceedings, except case management conferences (which are only available for complex cases). After rule 416U(5), insert: Subclause (2) does not apply if there is an emergency and the Judge does not consider it appropriate in the circumstances to hold a directions conference. These rules, which come into force on the day after the date of their notification in the Gazette, amend the Family Court Rules 2002 (the principal rules). The purpose of these rules is to facilitate the continuation of Family Court business during the outbreak of COVID-19 or any other emergency. These rules amend the principal rules to insert definitions of electronic address and emergency, and to provide that during an emergency— documents may be electronically filed: personal service of documents may be effected by transmitting them to an electronic address that the person effecting service knows to be regularly used by the person being served: unsworn affidavits may be filed and used in proceedings: Registrars may electronically sign orders and seal judgements: Judges have a discretion whether to hold a directions conference in proceedings filed without notice under the Care of Children Act 2004.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0105/latest/whole.html
2021-04-06T18:02:02,Financial Advisers (Custodian Assurance Engagement Relief—COVID-19) Exemption Notice 2020," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. Pursuant to sections 148 and 148A of the Financial Advisers Act 2008, the Financial Markets Authority, being satisfied of the matters set out in section 148(2)﻿(a) of that Act, gives the following notice. This notice is the Financial Advisers (Custodian Assurance Engagement Relief—COVID-19) Exemption Notice 2020. This notice comes into force on 29 April 2020. This notice is revoked on the close of 29 April 2022. In this notice, unless the context otherwise requires,— Act means the Financial Advisers Act 2008 Regulations means the Financial Advisers (Custodians of FMCA Financial Products) Regulations 2014 relevant date has the meaning set out in regulation 9(3) of the Regulations relevant period has the meaning set out in regulation 10(3) of the Regulations. Any term or expression that is defined in the Act or the Regulations and used, but not defined, in this notice has the same meaning as in the Act or the Regulations. A custodian (A) is exempted from regulation 9(1) of the Regulations to the extent that it requires A to comply within 4 months after a relevant date if A believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is not reasonably practicable for it to comply within that period because of the outbreak of COVID-19. The exemption in this clause applies in relation to relevant periods that end on or after 31 December 2019 but before 1 August 2020. The exemption in clause 5 is subject to the conditions that the custodian— complies with regulation 9(1) of the Regulations within 6 months after the relevant date; and gives to the FMA, within 4 months after the relevant date, a written notice that states that the custodian is relying on the exemption in clause 5. If subclause (1) would otherwise require a notice to be given to the FMA on or before 30 April 2020, the notice must instead be given on or before 15 May 2020. This clause amends the Financial Advisers (Overseas Custodians—Assurance Engagement) Exemption Notice 2018. After clause 7, insert: This clause applies if a custodian who is exempted under clause 5 believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is not reasonably practicable for it to comply with clause 6 within 4 months after the end of the exempt period because of the outbreak of COVID-19. The period for compliance in clause 6 is extended to 6 months after the end of the exempt period if the custodian gives to the FMA, within 4 months after the end of the exempt period, a written notice that states that the custodian is relying on this clause. If subclause (2) would otherwise require the notice to be given to the FMA on or before 30 April 2020, the notice must instead be given on or before 15 May 2020. This clause applies in relation to exempt periods that end on or after 31 December 2019 but before 1 August 2020. This clause amends the Financial Advisers (Non-NZX Brokers—Client Money) Exemption Notice 2017. After clause 7, insert: This clause applies if a non-NZX broker who is exempted under clause 5 believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is not reasonably practicable for it to comply with the obligation in clause 7(1)﻿(g) to obtain a report from a qualified auditor within 4 months after the relevant date because of the outbreak of COVID-19. The period for compliance with that obligation is extended to 6 months after the relevant date if the non-NZX broker gives to the FMA, within 4 months after the relevant date, a written notice that states that the non-NZX broker is relying on this clause. If subclause (2) would otherwise require the notice to be given to the FMA on or before 30 April 2020, the notice must instead be given on or before 15 May 2020. This clause applies in relation to relevant periods that end on or after 31 December 2019 but before 1 July 2020. This notice, which comes into force on 29 April 2020, exempts custodians from the duty under the Financial Advisers (Custodians of FMCA Financial Products) Regulations 2014 (the Regulations) to obtain an assurance engagement. The exemption applies to the extent that the duty requires compliance within 4 months after the custodian’s relevant date. The exemption applies if the custodian believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is not reasonably practicable for it to comply within that time frame because of the outbreak of COVID-19. The exemption is subject to conditions that the custodian— complies within an extended period of 2 months; and notifies the Financial Markets Authority (the FMA) that it is relying on the exemption. This notice also amends the Financial Advisers (Overseas Custodians—Assurance Engagement) Exemption Notice 2018 and the Financial Advisers (Non-NZX Brokers—Client Money) Exemption Notice 2017 (the class notices). To similar effect, the amendments extend the time frame for complying with a condition by 2 months if the market participant believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is not reasonably practicable for it to comply within that time frame because of the outbreak of COVID-19. The FMA, after satisfying itself as to the matters set out in section 148(2)﻿(a) of the Financial Advisers Act 2008, considers it appropriate to grant the exemption, and amend the class notices, because— compliance with the requirement for an assurance engagement under the Regulations and the class notices within current required time frames has or is likely to become practically difficult for some custodians and brokers as a consequence of the outbreak of COVID-19; and in these circumstances, they will require additional time to comply with their obligations; and taking a flexible approach and granting extended time for compliance will allow them (and their auditors) to meet the requirements under the Regulations and the class notices in a safe, efficient, and orderly manner and without unnecessary compliance costs; and this will also help ensure their processes, procedures, and controls are appropriately and effectively audited; and as such, the FMA is satisfied that costs of compliance with the relevant obligations within the original time frame would be unreasonable and would not be justified by the benefit of compliance. This is a reprint of the Financial Advisers (Custodian Assurance Engagement Relief—COVID-19) Exemption Notice 2020 that incorporates all the amendments to that notice as at the date of the last amendment to it. Reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by any amendments to that enactment. Section 18 of the Legislation Act 2012 provides that this reprint, published in electronic form, has the status of an official version under section 17 of that Act. A printed version of the reprint produced directly from this official electronic version also has official status.

2021-03-18T21:11:13,Financial Advisers (Non-NZX Brokers—Client Money) Exemption Amendment Notice 2020," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. Pursuant to sections 148 and 148A of the Financial Advisers Act 2008, the Financial Markets Authority, being satisfied of the matters set out in section 148(2) of that Act, gives the following notice. This notice is the Financial Advisers (Non-NZX Brokers—Client Money) Exemption Amendment Notice 2020. This notice comes into force on 30 September 2020. This notice amends the Financial Advisers (Non-NZX Brokers—Client Money) Exemption Notice 2017 (the principal notice). In clause 3, replace “30 November 2020” with “15 March 2021”. In clause 8(4), replace “1 July 2020” with “1 August 2020”. This notice, which comes into force on 30 September 2020, amends the Financial Advisers (Non-NZX Brokers—Client Money) Exemption Notice 2017 (the 2017 Notice). Section 77P(1A) of the Financial Advisers Act 2008 (the FA Act) requires brokers to keep client money and client property separate from their own money and property. The 2017 Notice exempts non-NZX brokers from that requirement subject to the conditions set out in the notice. The 2017 Notice is due to be revoked on 30 November 2020. The Financial Services Legislation Amendment Act 2019 (the 2019 Act) will repeal the FA Act and revoke the 2017 Notice. The relevant parts of the 2019 Act were due to come into force on 29 June 2020 (see the Financial Services Legislation Amendment Act Commencement Order 2019). However, because of the effects of COVID-19, commencement of those parts of the 2019 Act has been delayed and they will now come into force on 15 March 2021 (see the Financial Services Legislation Amendment Act Commencement Order 2020). This notice is therefore revoked on that date.  One of the conditions imposed by the 2017 Notice is that exempt brokers must obtain an auditor’s report about their compliance with the 2017 Notice within 4 months after their relevant date (usually their annual balance date). The effects of COVID-19 have made it difficult for some brokers to obtain their audit report by that deadline. The 2017 Notice was amended in April 2020 to give affected brokers an additional 2 months to comply. Currently, this covers brokers with a relevant date between 31 December 2019 and 1 July 2020. However, because of the continuing effects of COVID-19, this longer time frame now extends to also cover brokers whose relevant date is in July 2020. The FMA, after satisfying itself as to the matters set out in section 148(2)﻿(a) of the FA Act, considers it appropriate to amend the 2017 Notice because— the 2017 Notice has been in place for 3 years and the original policy reasons for it remain valid and relevant. The FMA is aware of likely continued reliance on the 2017 Notice until it is revoked by the 2019 Act: the costs of full and immediate compliance by brokers with section 77P(1A) of the FA Act if the term of the 2017 Notice were not extended, for the short period until it is revoked, would not be justified by the benefit of a significant reduction in risks for clients. This is a reprint of the Financial Advisers (Non-NZX Brokers—Client Money) Exemption Amendment Notice 2020 that incorporates all the amendments to that notice as at the date of the last amendment to it. Reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment and by any amendments to that enactment. Section 18 of the Legislation Act 2012 provides that this reprint, published in electronic form, has the status of an official version under section 17 of that Act.

The period for compliance in clause 6 is extended to 6 months after the end of the exempt period if the custodian gives to the FMA, within 4 months after the end of the exempt period, a written notice that states that the custodian is relying on this clause. If subclause (2) would otherwise require the notice to be given to the FMA on or before 30 April 2020, the notice must instead be given on or before 15 May 2020.

After clause 9, insert: This clause applies if a custodian that is exempted under clause 5 believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is not reasonably practicable for clause 6(c) to be complied with within 4 months of the relevant date because of the outbreak of COVID-19. The period for compliance in clause 6(c) is extended to 6 months after the relevant date if the custodian gives to the FMA, within 4 months after the relevant date, a written notice that states that the custodian is relying on this clause. This clause— applies in relation to relevant periods that end on or after 31 March 2020 but before 1 August 2020; and is revoked on the close of 29 April 2022. This notice, which comes into force on 29 April 2020, exempts certain financial market participants from compliance with certain obligations (for example, financial reporting duties) under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (the Act) and the Financial Markets Conduct Regulations 2014 (the Regulations). The exemptions only apply to the extent that the market participant is required to comply with the obligation  within a time frame (for example, within 4 months after the market participant’s balance date). The exemptions   apply  if  the  market  participant  believes,  on  reasonable grounds, that it is not reasonably practicable for it to comply within that time frame because of the outbreak of COVID-19. The exemptions are subject to conditions that the market participant— complies within an extended period of 2 months; and notifies the Financial Markets Authority (the FMA) that it is relying on the exemption; and in some cases, lodges the notice to the FMA with the Registrar of Financial Service Providers. This notice also amends a number of class exemptions issued by the FMA under the Act (the class notices). To similar effect, the amendments extend the time frame for complying with certain conditions by 2 months if the exempt person believes, on reasonable grounds, that it is not reasonably practicable for it to comply within that time frame because of the outbreak of COVID-19. The FMA, after satisfying itself as to the matters set out in section 557 of the Act and after consulting the Reserve Bank in accordance with section 561A(2) of the Act, considers it appropriate to grant the exemptions, and to amend the class notices, because— compliance with certain financial reporting, audit, and other duties under the Act, the Regulations, and the class notices within current required time frames has or is likely to become practically difficult for some market participants as a consequence of the outbreak of COVID-19; and in these circumstances, some market participants will require additional time to comply with their obligations; and taking a flexible approach and granting extended time for compliance will assist market participants to meet their obligations in a safe, efficient, and orderly manner and without unnecessary compliance costs and promote flexibility in the financial markets. This will also help ensure that the information provided to investors is appropriately prepared, accurate, and audited and that there is continued confidence and informed participation by investors and businesses in the financial markets; and as such, it is satisfied that the granting of the exemptions, and the amending of the class notices, is desirable in order to promote the purposes of the Act, specifically to provide for accurate information to be provided to persons to assist them to make decisions relating to financial products or the provision of  financial services, avoid unnecessary compliance costs, promote the confident and informed participation of businesses, investors, and consumers in the financial markets, and promote flexibility in those markets; and it is satisfied that the extent of the exemptions and the amendments is not broader than reasonably necessary to address the matters that gave rise to the exemptions and amendments, given that relief will only apply to market participants with balance dates or relevant dates, as the case may be, between 31 December 2019 and 1 August 2020 where it is not reasonably practicable for them to meet current reporting or audit time frames because of the outbreak of COVID-19.

These regulations, which come into force on 1 February 2021, amend the Fire and Emergency New Zealand (Fire Safety, Evacuation Procedures, and Evacuation Schemes) Regulations 2018 (the principal regulations). Similar amendments were made to the principal regulations by the Fire and Emergency New Zealand (COVID-19—Fire Safety, Evacuation Procedures, and Evacuation Schemes) Amendment Regulations 2020 (the earlier amendment regulations) which came into force on 22 May 2020. The affected provisions in the principal regulations require owners of buildings to— conduct trial evacuations of a building’s occupants at intervals of not more that 6 months (regulation 29(1)﻿(a)): implement an evacuation training programme that meets specified requirements, and includes details of the training and assessment of the permanent occupants of the building at intervals of not more than 6 months (regulation 33(1) and (2)): give notice of the evacuation training programme for the building at 6-monthly intervals (regulation 34(1) and (2)﻿(b)). The earlier amendment regulations had the effect of— temporarily suspending those requirements on and from 22 May 2020 and for the remainder of the period the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 (the COVID-19 Notice) is in force: requiring the calculation of the 6-month intervals in each case to exclude any days when the COVID-19 Notice is in force. The changes made by the earlier amendment regulations are retained by these regulations for buildings that are designated as managed isolation or quarantine facilities. For these buildings, the usual requirements for trial evacuations and evacuation training programmes are suspended while the COVID-19 Notice is in force and the calculation of the 6-month intervals excludes any days when that notice is in force.  These regulations add a second factor to apply to buildings that are not designated as managed isolation or quarantine facilities. For these buildings, the usual requirements for trial evacuations and evacuation training programmes are suspended, and the calculation of the 6-month intervals excludes any days, when both— the COVID-19 Notice is in force; and physical distancing requirements are in place for the area in which the building is located. For these temporary changes to the principal regulations,— managed isolation or quarantine facility has the meaning given in section 5(1) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 physical distancing requirements means any requirements imposed under an enactment for people to stay physically distant from other people to prevent the outbreak or spread of COVID-19.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0312/latest/whole.html

Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. Pursuant to section 70(1)﻿(f) and (m) of the Health Act 1956, for the purpose of preventing the outbreak or spread of COVID-19, an infectious disease, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, Director-General of Health, exercising the functions of a Medical Officer of Health for all districts of New Zealand (that is, nationally), in circumstances where a state of emergency has been declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 and there is an epidemic notice in force, makes the following order. This Order is the Health Act (COVID-19 Alert Level 3) Order 2020. This order comes into force at 11.59 pm on 27 April 2020. On 24 March 2020, the Prime Minister, with the agreement of the Minister of Health, gave a notice under section 5 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006. The epidemic notice allows the use of special powers by the Medical Officer of Health in accordance with section 70 of the Health Act 1956 for the purpose of preventing the outbreak or spread of COVID-19. A state of national emergency was declared under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, with effect from 12.21pm on 25 March 2020. It has been extended weekly since 25 March 2020 and may be further extended. From 25 March 2020, an order under section 70(1)﻿(m) of the Health Act 1956 required that premises be closed and forbade congregation in outdoor places of amusement or recreation. From 31 March 2020, an order under section 70(1)﻿(f) of the Health Act 1956 applied to arrivals into New Zealand providing certain isolation or quarantining requirements. From 3 April 2020, an order under section 70(1)﻿(f) of the Health Act 1956 applied to all persons in New Zealand providing certain isolation or quarantining requirements. From 9 April 2020, an order under section 70(1)﻿(e), (ea), and (f) of the Health Act 1956 applied to arrivals by air into New Zealand providing further isolation or quarantining requirements. The purpose of this order is to prevent the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 by limiting the movement of people, and contact between people, in New Zealand, in aggregate, while— ensuring the provision of services that are needed to respond to COVID-19, ensure the necessities of life for people in New Zealand, and maintain public health, safety, and security; and enabling some movement and contact in particular— for the purposes of education, work, accessing services, and limited recreation; and where public health measures such as good hygiene and cleaning measures, physical distancing, contact tracing, and minimising interactions in groups apply (whether under this order, other health and safety requirements, or guidance). In this order, guidance includes public health guidance issued by the Ministry of Health, workplace guidance issued by WorkSafe, maritime guidance issued by Maritime New Zealand, and guidance issued to education entities by the Ministry of Education. Schedule 1 defines the terms used in this order. All persons within all regions of New Zealand must be isolated or quarantined as follows: to remain at their current home or place of residence, except for essential personal movement; and to maintain physical distancing, except— from any fellow resident; or to the extent necessary to access, or provide, a business or service to which physical distancing infection control measures apply under clause 10; and if their home or place of residence is mobile, to keep that home or place of residence in the same general location, except to the extent they would be permitted (if it were not mobile) to leave the home or place of residence as essential personal movement. This requirement does not apply to a person while the Health Act (Managed Air Arrivals) Order or the Health Act (Other Arrivals) Order applies to that person. A person is permitted to do any of the following as essential personal movement: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of accessing any business or service that has the relevant infection control measures in operation if— doing so for their own needs or on behalf of a fellow resident, a vulnerable person, or a high-risk person;

and the education entity is in the same or an adjacent region: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of providing a business or service that has the relevant infection control measures in operation (or to do necessary work at any premises under clause 9(3)) if the business or service is— in the same or an adjacent region; or in another region to the extent that doing so is necessary for the purpose of a business or service listed in Part 3 of Schedule 2 (and, if necessary, stay in temporary accommodation in that region), and then return to their home or place of residence: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of working at an education entity that has the relevant infection control measures in operation if the education entity is in the same or an adjacent region: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of exercise or other recreation if— it is done in an outdoor place appropriate for that kind of exercise or recreation that is readily accessible (including by using their vehicle) from their home or place of residence (and, in any case, is within the same or an adjacent region); and it is done in compliance with the requirements that relate to physical distancing (see clause 6(1)﻿(b)) and the prohibition against congregating (see clause 11); and it does not involve flying manned aircraft, scuba-diving, hunting in motorised vehicles, hunting or killing of game birds, or water-based activities involving sailing boats, motorised craft, or motorised equipment; and it does not involve any other activities that expose the participant to danger (taking account of their experience and abilities): leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of exercising Māori customary rights to fishing and food gathering if— it is done in an outdoor place appropriate for that kind of activity that is readily accessible (including by using their vehicle) from their home or place of residence (and, in any case, is within the same or an adjacent region); and it is done in compliance with the requirements that relate to physical distancing (see clause 6(1)﻿(b)) and the prohibition against congregating (see clause 11); and it does not involve flying manned aircraft, scuba-diving, hunting in motorised vehicles, or water-based activities involving sailing boats, motorised craft, or motorised equipment; and it does not involve any other activities that expose the participant to danger (taking account of their experience and abilities): leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of attending— a controlled gathering in the same or an adjacent region; or a controlled gathering in another region if it is a funeral service or tangihanga: leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of visiting or staying at another home or place of residence (and then visiting or staying) if those homes or residences have an extended bubble arrangement and are in the same or adjacent regions: if a child, leave the extended bubble arrangement of 1 shared caregiver for the purpose of visiting or staying at the extended bubble arrangement of another shared caregiver (and then visiting or staying): relocate their home or place of residence or business premises, and leave their home or place of residence or business premises for the purpose of arranging and carrying out the relocation (including for inspection of the property or a potential property): leave their home or place of residence for the purpose of accessing medical services, or for the purpose of visiting people in hospital care facilities, rest home facilities, or residential disability care facilities (as those terms are defined in the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001): leave their home or place of residence to care for their pets or other animals in the same or an adjacent region: leave their home or place of residence to attend a court, tribunal, New Zealand Parole Board hearing, or other judicial institution: leave their home or place of residence if necessary to preserve their own or any other person’s life or safety:  change their home or place of residence if necessary to use another temporary or emergency home (for example, for care while sick or to seek refuge in women’s refuge accommodation):  leave or change their home or place of residence as required by a court order or any other power under any enactment to order a person to be detained, to change their place of detention, or otherwise determine their place of residence (for example, a direction of the New Zealand Parole Board or a probation officer), or to return to a home or place of residence after that detention or determination ceases: in the case of a person who has arrived in New Zealand (and to whom the Health Act (Managed Air Arrivals) Order or the Health Act (Other Arrivals) Order does not or no longer applies), travel directly to their intended home or place of residence in New Zealand: in the case of a person intending to leave New Zealand to return to their home jurisdiction, travel directly to the airport from which they will leave New Zealand (without using a Cook Strait ferry service) or to any place of isolation or quarantine to be undertaken immediately before they leave New Zealand: leave their home or place of residence to undertake travel that is permitted by the Director-General on the basis that— it is for the purpose of urgent care for a child or for the purpose of supporting a person in a critical or terminal condition; and no other appropriate person is able to provide that care or support: leave their home or place of residence to assist another fellow resident to travel to carry out essential personal movement or to accompany a fellow resident carrying out essential personal movement. The purpose of clauses 9 and 10 is to restrict the use of premises unless there are key public health measures in place to minimise the risk of movement, contact, or congregation of people (without limiting other public health measures that should also be taken to meet health and safety requirements and other guidance). Restricted premises of the kinds to which infection control measures apply under clause 10 must be closed in all districts of New Zealand unless the required infection control measures are operating. All other restricted premises must be closed. However, this clause does not prevent a person from undertaking any necessary work in any restricted premises for either of the following purposes: minimum basic operations required to maintain the condition or value of, or clean, the premises, plant, equipment, or goods, care for animals, receive stock or freight, and enable and support workers to be able to continue to work remotely from their homes: work required to prepare the premises for opening (and meet public health guidance). For the purposes of this clause and clause 10,— premises are restricted unless they are premises described in section 70(1A) of the Act (for example, private dwellinghouses or courts); and restricted premises are under the control of a business or service to the extent those premises are managed or controlled by the person or entity that carries on the business or service. For the purposes of clause 9, the following are the required infection control measures for restricted premises under the control of businesses or services of the following kind:  For the purposes of this clause, an infection control measure of the following kind requires sufficient systems and processes to do the following: ensure physical distancing can be maintained by persons accessing and using the premises, so far as is reasonably practicable taking into account the nature of the business or service; and mitigate the risks that arise to the extent physical distancing is not fully maintained on the premises: ensure no customers or clients enter the premises (other than only, and then to the minimum extent necessary, to collect goods through a method that minimises physical contact and does not involve entering a building); and ensure there is no close personal contact with customers or clients: for all education entities, keep children, students, and teachers, to the extent reasonably practicable, in groups that are appropriately sized and stable; and for schools, limit students’ physical attendance to years 1 to 10: ensure the premises are used only for the purpose of a controlled gathering. A clothing retail business wants to operate under Alert level 3. It prohibits customers from entering but also offers an online ordering and pick-up or delivery service. The pick-up service is a “click and collect” service from the underground carpark outside the shopping mall (to comply with the requirement under this clause to minimise physical contact for collection of goods). The online delivery service is also contactless (so as to comply with the requirement for physical distancing that applies to all persons under clause 6(1)﻿(b)). People must not congregate in any restricted place. A place is restricted for the purpose of this clause if it is an outdoor place of amusement or recreation other than a venue used for gatherings that has the applicable infection control measures in operation. The Health Act (Other Arrivals) Order is amended by replacing “(except those air crew who have used appropriate personal protective equipment in accordance with Ministry of Health guidelines)” with “(except those to whom the order made under section 70(1)﻿(f) on 9 April 2020 applies, excluded arrivals under that order, or air crew who have used appropriate personal protective equipment in accordance with Ministry of Health guidelines)”.

This order is the Health Act (COVID-19 Alert Level 3) Amendment Order 2020. This order comes into force on 30 April 2020.

2020-04-09T15:44:27,High Court (COVID-19 Preparedness) Amendment Rules 2020," These rules are made under section 148 of the Senior Courts Act 2016— on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council; and with the concurrence of the Right Honourable the Chief Justice and at least 2 other members of the Rules Committee continued under section 155 of that Act (of whom at least 1 was a Judge of the High Court). These rules are the High Court (COVID-19 Preparedness) Amendment Rules 2020. These rules come into force immediately upon their notification in the Gazette. These rules amend the High Court Rules 2016. In rule 1.3(1), replace the definition of to file with: to file, in relation to any document, means to file the document pursuant to rule 5.1A in the proper registry of the court Rule 3.4 is revoked and the following rules substituted: Despite rule 3.1, the Chief High Court Judge may order that the court or one or more of its registries be closed for a period not exceeding one week specified in the order if an emergency exists in the place where the court or one or more of its registries is located. For the avoidance of doubt, the Chief High Court Judge may make orders under subclause (1) in respect of consecutive periods of time. In these rules, emergency includes the existence of a state of danger to the health and wellbeing of persons in a place (including the whole of New Zealand) as a result of the existence of a natural disaster, pandemic, armed conflict, or the like in that place: provided that, for the purposes of these rules, an emergency exists in a place in respect of which,— an epidemic notice has been given pursuant to section 5(1) of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006; or a state of national emergency has been declared pursuant to section 66(1) of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002; or a state of local emergency has been declared pursuant to section 68(1) of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. A Registrar must ensure that an order made under subclause (1) is immediately advertised in the manner the Judge directs. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this rule, or any other provision of these rules, relating to the powers of a Judge in respect of a proceeding in circumstances in which an emergency exists is intended to limit the court’s inherent jurisdiction. Where an emergency exists in any part of New Zealand, a Judge may make a direction as to the form of participation by counsel, parties, witnesses, and other persons at any hearing or trial conducted pursuant to these rules, by— dispensing with any requirement for a person to be physically present in the court and make provision for an alternative means of complying with any such requirement: directing particular methods of attendance at, and participation in, a hearing or trial (for example, in person, by telephone, or by audio-visual link) that will be permitted, required, or excused: directing where and how any person attending or participating in a hearing or trial in person must conduct themselves in respect of their physical proximity to other persons in attendance: requiring any person attending or participating in a hearing or trial in person to be attired in a particular manner. No direction may be made under subclause (1) that modifies any requirement imposed by another provision of these rules more than is reasonably necessary to protect the health and wellbeing of those required or compelled to attend or participate in a hearing or trial, having regard also to,— the requirements of natural justice; and the rights affirmed by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. Subject to subclause (2), the power in subclause (1) may be exercised notwithstanding that it is contrary to any other provision of these rules, regulation, or rule of law. After rule 5.1, insert: In this rule and in rule 5.1B,— electronic address means any method by which a document communicated in electronic form may be directed to the attention of a particular user of an electronic communications or information management, retrieval, or storage system, and includes, without limitation,— email addresses; and fax numbers; and remotely accessible locations in file directories located on computer hard-drives, servers, or internet-based servers published means having been made available at all reasonable times on an Internet website maintained by or on behalf of a Registrar Subject to subclauses (3) to (8), any document required by these rules to be filed may be filed in the proper registry of the court by— delivering it to that registry by hand during registry hours; or sending it by mail to a postal address for that registry published by a Registrar; or sending a copy of that document in electronic form to an electronic address— to which the person filing the document has been directed by the court or a Registrar to send any documents that are to be filed electronically in a particular proceeding or interlocutory application; or where no such direction has been made in respect of the particular proceeding or interlocutory application to which the document relates, to an electronic address published by a Registrar for the purpose of allowing the electronic filing of documents in the proper registry of the court. Subclause (4) applies where any copy of any document filed by means of an electronic communication pursuant to these rules contains a signature or other mark or writing intended by the person responsible for the inclusion of that signature or other mark or writing in the document to convey their authorisation, certification, endorsement or authentication of any matter contained within the document copied. In respect of a copy of a document to which this subclause applies, despite any provision in these rules, or in any enactment, regulation or rule of law to the contrary, that copy of a document, and any matter contained within it, is deemed to have been sufficiently authorised, certified, authenticated, signed, or otherwise endorsed for the purposes of these rules as if the original document had been filed. For the avoidance of doubt, parties to proceedings and interlocutory applications are not required to have regard to High Court Practice Note 2019/1 (The Use of Electronic Common Bundles and Electronic Casebooks in the High Court) so far as that practice note requires the delivery of any common bundle or casebook to a registry by hand or by post, provided that parties must have regard to that practice note so far as it regulates the preparation and format of, and technical requirements for, the electronic common bundle or casebook. A Judge (including an Associate Judge) may, if satisfied that an emergency in the place at which the registry of the court in question is situated means that the filing of documents other than electronically would cause, or risk causing, disruption to the orderly and safe dispatch of the court’s business, require that—  any document required to be filed by these rules in the proper registry of the court; or any document intended by any person to be filed in a given registry of the court— must not be filed pursuant to the provisions of subclause (2)﻿(a) and must instead be filed pursuant to the provisions of either subclause (2)﻿(b) or (c). Subject to subclause (8), in the event of any inconsistency between any provision of this rule and any other provision of these rules or any other enactment, this rule prevails. This rule is subject to rule 5.1B. Subject to subclause (2), and despite any other provision of these rules or any other enactment or regulation to the contrary, a document— delivered by hand to a registry of the court pursuant to rule 5.1A(2)﻿(a) is filed on the day on which it is accepted for filing by the registry and at the time at which the registry receives it: sent by mail to a postal address in accordance with rule 5.1A(2)﻿(b) is filed when the registry receives it: filed by sending it to an electronic address in accordance with rule 5.1A(2)﻿(c)— is filed when it is received by the relevant electronic communications or information management, retrieval, or storage system, provided the document is received by that system during registry hours; or at 9 am on the first day on which the relevant registry of the court is open after the document is received by the relevant electronic communications or information management, retrieval, or storage system. A document is not filed until the earlier of the time that either— any fee prescribed for the filing of that document by a provision of the High Court Fees Regulations 2013 has been paid; or the person responsible for the filing of the document has, in a manner directed by a Registrar, either— provided a Registrar with a credit card payment authority for a sum equal to the fee payable for the filing of that document; or where the court is able to facilitate it, paid a sum equal to the fee payable for the filing of that document by means of electronic bank transfer into an account identified by the Registrar for that purpose; or in any case where the Registrar accepts it is impracticable for the person presenting the document to effect payment of the fee by any other means, and—  there is a solicitor on the record for the party seeking to file the document, by providing together with the document filed that solicitor’s unconditional undertaking to the court to make the payment of the fee for the filing of that document within three working days from the day on which the document has been filed; or where the party seeking to file a document is represented by a barrister sole permitted to represent that party without the intervention of an instructing lawyer pursuant to rules 14.4 to 14.12 of the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act (Lawyers: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008, by providing together with the document filed that barrister sole’s unconditional undertaking to the court to make payment of the fee for the filing of that document within three working days from the day on which the document has been filed: provided that in any case where an undertaking under this paragraph has not been fulfilled within the time provided for payment, the court may order that no reliance can be placed on that document or that the document not be used in the proceeding until the payment is received; or  the Registrar has determined that the document is to be treated as having been filed despite non-payment of the fee: provided that such a determination may be made only if the court is satisfied that doing so is necessary in the interests of justice, having regard to— the circumstances of the proceeding or interlocutory application in question; and the existence of an emergency in the place at which the registry of the court in question is situated. Rule 5.6 is revoked. Rule 6.1 is amended by inserting the following subclause after subclause (3): This rule is subject to rule 6.1A. After rule 6.1, insert: Any contrary provision of these rules notwithstanding, a Judge (including an Associate Judge) may, in respect of a proceeding, if satisfied that the existence of an emergency in any part of New Zealand means the service of documents by other than electronic means would cause or risk causing disruption to the orderly and safe dispatch of the court’s business or harm to the health and wellbeing of any person, require that— any party that has not already done so specify an electronic address by which documents can be served on that party pursuant to rule 6.1(1)﻿(d)﻿(iii); or any document required by any person to be served on any other person not be served pursuant to rules 6.1(1)﻿(a), (b), (c), or (d)﻿(ii) and must instead be served pursuant to rule 6.1(1)﻿(d)﻿(i) or (iii). Rule 7.3(8) is revoked. Rule 7.21(1) and (2) are revoked. Rule 9.7(4)﻿(a) is revoked. Rule 9.12(1) is amended by omitting “signed”. Rule 9.13(2) is amended by omitting “by the person who signed the brief” and substituting “by the person to whose evidence that brief relates”. Rule 9.62(2)﻿(b) and (6) are revoked. Rule 19.10(1)﻿(c) is revoked. Replace rule 9.73 with: Subject to subclauses (4) to (6), an affidavit may be read and used in a proceeding or in respect of an interlocutory application only if it complies with subclause (2) or (3). A sworn affidavit must be sworn— in accordance with the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957; and before a person authorised to administer oaths under that Act or under rule 9.85 or 9.86. An affirmed affidavit must comply with the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957. Subject to subclause (5), a Judge or Registrar may direct that an affidavit that does not comply with either subclause (2) or (3) may— be accepted for filing in respect of a proceeding or interlocutory application; and nonetheless be read and used in a proceeding or interlocutory application. A Judge may make an order, and a Registrar may make a direction, under subclause (4) in respect of an affidavit only if— satisfied that, due to the existence of an emergency in any part of New Zealand, requiring the affidavit to comply with either subclause (2) or (3) would— cause an unacceptable delay in the resolution of the proceeding, having regard to the nature and urgency of that proceeding or any application connected with it; or endanger the health and wellbeing of any person; and the affidavit is presented for filing together with a memorandum of counsel— confirming that the document contains the same evidentiary matter as the affidavit complying with either subclause (2) or (3) that the intending deponent would have sworn to or affirmed had an emergency not existed; and undertaking that an affidavit complying with either subclause (2) or (3) containing the same evidentiary matter as that presented for filing will be filed as soon as circumstances reasonably permit; and the affidavit contains, or there is attached to or covering the affidavit a document containing, a statement from the intending deponent to the effect that the matters stated in the affidavit are to the best of his or her knowledge true and correct. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any inconsistency between subclauses (4) and (5) and any other provisions of these rules, subclauses (4) and (5) prevail. These rules, which come into force immediately upon their notification in the Gazette, have been prepared in circumstances of urgency to facilitate the continuation of civil proceedings in the High Court during the course of the outbreak of COVID-19. These rules amend the High Court Rules 2016 to— ensure hearings can proceed with remote participation: allow for the electronic filing of documents: provide for reliance on unsworn affidavits. The continuing need for these amendments will be reviewed by the Rules Committee on a decision by the Government that the outbreak is at an end.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0059/latest/whole.html

The amendment to regulation 23N clarifies that if the Minister has suspended a waiver of the requirement to hold a visa to travel to New Zealand in respect of a person, then that person’s electronic travel authority (ETA) ceases to be valid. The amendment to regulation 34 gives the Minister the power to issue a special direction extending the time by which a person who has not been granted a visa or entry permission, and who arrives at New Zealand at a place other than an immigration control area, must report to an immigration officer at an immigration control area. The time limit in regulation 29 is within 72 hours, but that period may sometimes need to be extended, for example, if a ship has arrived in New Zealand waters and is liable to quarantine or has been quarantined. The amendment to Schedule 3 has the effect of inserting extra wording into 2 items that relate to cruise ship passengers and crew. Schedule 3 describes people who are deemed to hold a visa and to have been granted entry permission to New Zealand. The new wording is contained in new paragraph (a) of each item, which provides that the deemed entry permission and visa only apply to passengers and crew on board a cruise ship that has been granted pratique under the Health Act 1956. Pratique is permission granted to a ship to berth at a wharf or other landing place and is given when the relevant medical officer of health or health protection officer is satisfied that no quarantinable disease exists on board.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0040/latest/whole.html

These regulations, which come into force on the day after the date they are notified in the Gazette (the commencement date), amend the Land Transport (Motor Vehicle Registration and Licensing) Regulations 2011. New regulation 14A extends the duration of motor vehicle licences in 2 categories. The categories are licences that— expired or will expire between 1 January 2020 and the day before the commencement date (inclusive) and that remain expired on the commencement date; and expire in the period between the commencement date and 6 months after the commencement date (inclusive). Licences in these 2 categories have effect on and for 6 months from the commencement date. A person’s liability for fees and accident insurance levies is not affected by this change and remains the same as if their licence had otherwise expired. The offence provisions in regulations 77 and 78 do not apply to a person who has a licence in either of those 2 categories for the period the licence remains in effect under new regulation 14A.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0056/latest/whole.html
2021-01-11T14:28:52,Local Government Members (Temporary Reduction—COVID-19) Determination 2020," Changes authorised by subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Legislation Act 2012 have been made in this official reprint. Note 4 at the end of this reprint provides a list of the amendments incorporated. Pursuant to section 19A of the Remuneration Authority Act 1977 and to clause 6 of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002, the Remuneration Authority, after having regard to the matters specified in clause 7 of that schedule, makes the following determination (to which is appended an explanatory memorandum). This determination is the Local Government Members (Temporary Reduction—COVID-19) Determination 2020. This determination comes into force on 9 July 2020. This determination applies to the Local Government Members (2020/21) Determination 2020 (the original determination). While this determination is in force, the remuneration of an officeholder that is specified in the Schedule of the original determination must be read as if it were the remuneration for that officeholder that is set out in the Schedule of this determination (if any). This determination expires on 6 January 2021. Note: The following explanatory memorandum should be read in conjunction with the explanatory memorandum(s) appended to the: Local Government Members (Temporary Reduction—COVID-19) Amendment Determination (No 2) 2020 Local Government Members (Temporary Reduction—COVID-19) Amendment Determination 2020 This temporary reduction determination affects the Local Government Members (2019/20) Determination 2019 (the original determination). This determination commences on 9 July 2020 and expires on 6 January 2021. On 15 May 2020, the Remuneration Authority (COVID-19 Measures) Amendment Act 2020 (the Amendment Act) was passed.  The purpose of the amendment Act, as outlined in its explanatory note, is to allow public sector leaders, including elected members of local authorities (mayors, deputy mayors, chairpersons, deputy chairpersons, and members), to show leadership in the public sector during the COVID-19 outbreak and to show solidarity with those in the private sector who are losing their jobs or facing significant pay reductions.  Accordingly, the Amendment Act inserted section 19A into the Remuneration Authority Act 1977 to permit the Authority to reduce the remuneration for certain public office holders, including local government elected members (listed in Schedule 4A of the Amendment Act).  The remuneration of local government elected members is set according to the Remuneration Authority Act 1977 and the Local Government Act 2002 with the underlying premise to depoliticise the setting of their remuneration.  The Authority is generally not permitted to make a determination that reduces existing elected members’ pay and their remuneration must be paid according to the determination that is presently in force.  However, section 19A overrides aspects of the legislative regime by permitting a capped reduction of elected members’ remuneration by up to 20% for a period of up to 6 months.  In making this temporary reduction determination, the Authority has applied the existing criteria that it must take into account when setting the remuneration of elected members, which include taking account of any prevailing adverse economic conditions, fairness to the person whose remuneration is being determined, and fairness to ratepayers (see clause 7 of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002 and section 18A of the Remuneration Authority Act 1977). The adjusted remuneration payable to elected members as shown in the Schedule of this determination will apply on and from the day on which this determination comes into force until it expires. In making its decisions on any deductions in elected members’ pay, the Authority took account of the fact that many elected members are on relatively low rates of remuneration and decided that cuts would apply only to remuneration above $100,000 per annum. The Authority is aware that elected members are easily identified in their communities, highly exposed to public opinion, and expected to show pro-active leadership. At the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, many elected members publicly pledged to donate a proportion of their remuneration to local charities—some for several months. The Authority therefore invited those potentially impacted by its decision to provide confidential information to the Authority with details of any such donations they wished to have taken into account. Some took advantage of this and the deduction was adjusted accordingly. For a variety of reasons, others indicated that they did not wish to provide information. The Authority’s decisions were made on the basis of the information supplied. On the day after this temporary reduction determination expires, the elected members’ remuneration will revert to the amount payable under the original determination.

MBIE is authorised to require a digital boost applicant to register for an NZBN and to provide the NZBN to MBIE. In this regulation,— digital boost applicant means an eligible entity that applies to MBIE for support under the digital boost scheme digital boost scheme means the small business digital boost initiative— established by the New Zealand Government in December 2020 as part of its COVID-19 recovery programme, and as varied from time to time; and under which MBIE provides, or facilitates the provision of, digital business skills training, advisory services, support, and tools.

2020-05-12T13:02:38,New Zealand Business Number (Organisation Parts Data) Order 2020," This order is made under section 22 of the New Zealand Business Number Act 2016— on the advice and with the consent of the Executive Council; and on the recommendation of the Minister for Small Business made in accordance with section 22(2) of that Act. This order is the New Zealand Business Number (Organisation Parts Data) Order 2020. This order comes into force on 12 May 2020. In Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 4 of the New Zealand Business Number Act 2016, after the item relating to Australian Business Number (ABN), insert: For each organisation part that the entity wants recorded on the register— unique identifying number, the format of which has been approved by the Registrar name (or if it is not named, an identifying description) purpose or purposes (such as functions, scopes, areas of operation, or intended uses or services)   This order, which comes into force on 12 May 2020, adds information concerning organisation parts to the lists of information in Schedule 4 of the New Zealand Business Number Act 2016. The effect of this is that businesses in New Zealand that are organised into parts will be able to choose to have a unique identifying number assigned to a part (or parts) of the business, and for that information to be displayed on the New Zealand Business Number Register. In most cases, a New Zealand Business Number identifying the principal business is sufficient to enable a business to interact with other organisations and accurately identify itself. For others, it is useful to be able to represent different parts of the business; for example, certain internal business units or offices in different geographic locations. The ability to identify different parts of a business with certainty will also contribute to the Government’s proposal to develop contact tracing systems in response to the effects of COVID-19. Accordingly, the order will come into force earlier than 28 days after the date of its notification in the Gazette.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0079/latest/whole.html

Pursuant to sections 12 and 19A of the Remuneration Authority Act 1977 and to section 8 of the Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Services) Act 2013, the Remuneration Authority makes the following determination (to which is appended an explanatory memorandum). This determination is the Parliamentary Salaries and Allowances (Temporary Reduction—COVID-19) Determination 2020. This determination comes into force on 9 July 2020.

The purpose of the Amendment Act is to allow public sector leaders, including members of Parliament (MPs), to show leadership in the public sector during the COVID-19 outbreak and to show solidarity with those in the private sector who are losing their jobs or facing significant pay reductions. Accordingly, the Amendment Act inserted section 19A into the Remuneration Authority Act 1977 to permit the Authority to reduce the remuneration of certain public office-holders, including MPs (listed in Schedule 4A of the Amendment Act). The salaries of MPs are set according to criteria in the Remuneration Authority Act 1977 with the underlying premise of de-politicising the setting of their remuneration. The Authority is generally not permitted to make a determination that reduces existing MPs’ pay and their pay must be paid according to the determination that is currently in force. However, section 19A overrides aspects of the legislative regime by permitting a capped reduction of MPs’ salaries by up to 20% for a period of up to 6 months. In making this temporary reduction determination, the Authority has applied the existing criteria that it must take into account when setting the remuneration of MPs, which include taking account of any prevailing adverse economic conditions, fairness to the person whose remuneration is being determined, and fairness to the taxpayer (see sections 18 and 18A of the Remuneration Authority Act 1977).

These regulations are the Public and Community Housing Management (Prescribed Elements of Calculation Mechanism) (COVID-19 Income Relief Payment to be Income) Amendment Regulations 2020. These regulations come into force on 8 June 2020. These regulations amend the Public and Community Housing Management (Prescribed Elements of Calculation Mechanism) Regulations 2018 (the principal regulations). In regulation 3(1), insert in their appropriate alphabetical order: COVID-19 income relief payment means all or a portion of a payment under the COVID-19 Income Relief Payment Programme COVID-19 Income Relief Payment Programme means— that programme as approved and established under section 101 of the Social Security Act 2018; or if that programme is revoked, a programme— also approved and established under section 101 of that Act; and that, with or without modification, replaces, or that corresponds to, that programme After regulation 13(a)﻿(i), insert: a COVID-19 income relief payment; or In the Schedule, replace Part 1 with the Parts 1 and 2 set out in the Schedule of these regulations. There are no transitional, savings, or related provisions relating to these regulations as made. This clause takes effect when the COVID-19 Income Relief Payment Programme is revoked and not replaced. In regulation 3(1), revoke the definitions of COVID-19 income relief payment and COVID-19 Income Relief Payment Programme. Revoke regulation 13(a)﻿(ia). In this clause, COVID-19 Income Relief Payment Programme has the meaning in regulation 4 of the Public and Community Housing Management (Prescribed Elements of Calculation Mechanism) (COVID-19 Income Relief Payment to be Income) Amendment Regulations 2020. The revocation of regulation 13(a)﻿(ia) does not affect its operation— on or after 8 June 2020; and before it is revoked by clause 2. These regulations, which come into force on 8 June 2020, amend the Public and Community Housing Management (Prescribed Elements of Calculation Mechanism) Regulations 2018 (the principal regulations). The amendments are about a person’s weekly income for the purposes of public housing. In particular, the amendments ensure that a person’s weekly income for calculation of income-related rent includes a payment received by the person under the COVID-19 Income Relief Payment Programme (the Programme) (see new regulation 13(a)﻿(ia), and regulation 14(a)﻿(i), of the principal regulations). The Programme will be approved and established under the Social Security Act 2018. Payments under the Programme will provide temporary income relief to people who have lost their jobs as a result of the impact of COVID-19, and will be paid for up to 12 weeks instead of an income-tested main benefit under that Act. The intention is to ease the income shock individuals and whānau may experience from unemployment. The Programme will come into force on 8 June 2020 and will be available for eligible people who have lost their jobs on or after 1 March 2020 and no later than 30 October 2020. People will be able to apply until 13 November 2020. The change made through these amendments will ensure that access to support provided under the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 takes into account the actual financial resources a person is receiving. This is consistent with how income-tested main benefits under the Social Security Act 2018 are treated for public housing purposes. The Treasury has determined that these regulations are a direct COVID-19 response and has suspended the RIA requirements (in accordance with CAB-20-MIN-0138).",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0098/latest/whole.html

These regulations are the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) Amendment Regulations 2020. These regulations come into force on 30 June 2020. These regulations amend the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) Regulations 2019 (the principal regulations). In Schedule 1, clause 11(1), replace “1 July 2020” with “1 December 2020”. These regulations, which come into force on 30 June 2020, change the date by which landlords must include in any new or renewed tenancy agreements a statement of their level of compliance with the Residential Tenancies (Healthy Homes Standards) Regulations 2019 (the healthy homes standards). Section 13A of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (the Act) sets out the information that must be included in a tenancy agreement. Under section 13A(1CA), landlords must include a statement that they will comply with the healthy homes standards, as well as (under regulations 33 to 39 of the healthy homes standards) detailed information about the landlord’s current level of compliance. The information concerning the landlord’s current level of compliance must be included in any tenancy agreement or renewal made and signed by the landlord on or after 1 July 2020. The impact of COVID-19 restrictions has meant that landlords have been unable to collect the compliance information needed for the statement (for example, landlords have been unable to access properties in order to assess insulation levels). Accordingly, regulation 4 amends clause 11(1) of Schedule 1 to delay the date by which landlords will be required to include this information from 1 July 2020 to 1 December 2020. The deadlines for landlords to meet the healthy homes standards are unchanged.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0101/latest/whole.html

Regulation 28(1)﻿(a), (3)﻿(aa), and (4) applies, on and after the commencement, on 25 August 2020, of the Social Security (COVID-19—Childcare Assistance) Amendment Regulations 2020, to a child who is eligible for childcare assistance regardless of whether the child became eligible for the assistance— before that commencement; or on or after that commencement. These regulations, which come into force on 25 August 2020, amend the Social Security Regulations 2018. The amendments are about childcare assistance (a childcare subsidy or an out-of-school care and recreation (OSCAR) subsidy). In particular, regulation 28 is amended to ensure that the assistance may continue to be paid during a child’s temporary absence, due to COVID-19 requirements, from— an early childhood education programme; or an out-of-school care and recreation (OSCAR) programme. The purpose of assistance made available under regulation 28 is to keep the child’s place open in a childcare facility or programme during the child’s absence. New regulation 28(1) ensures that the assistance may continue to be paid (at the hourly rate required by regulation 24(1)﻿(b)) for a period during a child’s absence from the programme— if the absence is due to COVID-19 requirements (as that term is defined in new regulation 28(4)), and whether or not the programme charges a fee for holding open the places of children who are absent; or if the absence is due to the child’s medical condition, or is due to any other reason, and the programme charges a fee for holding open the places of children who are absent. Regulation 28(3) as amended ensures that the period must not exceed— the weeks of the absence, if the absence is due to COVID-19 requirements; or 6 weeks, if the absence is due to the child’s medical condition; or 3 weeks, if the absence is due to any other reason. Under regulation 28(2), the period is calculated as— commencing on the first day of the child’s absence from the programme; and including only the time during the absence when the programme is available. The programme is available, as that term is defined in new regulation 28(4), if the absence is due to COVID-19 requirements (and so new regulation 28(3)﻿(aa) applies to the child) and— the programme is attended by, and provided to, any other child, or any other children, to whom COVID-19 requirements do not apply; or the programme is not attended by, nor provided to, any children, because their absence is due to reasons that are or include COVID-19 requirements. New regulation 28(1)﻿(a), (3)﻿(aa), and (4) applies, on and after the commencement, on 25 August 2020, of these regulations, to a child who is eligible for childcare assistance regardless of whether the child became eligible for the assistance— before that commencement; or on or after that commencement. The Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in these regulations are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS).",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0223/latest/whole.html

These regulations replace regulation 179A(2) and (3) with new regulation 179A(1A), (2), and (3). New regulation 179(1A) restates, in a separate subclause, the current 2 conditions for when the benefit commences under regulation 179A(2). New regulation 179A(2) ensures that the benefit commences not, as under regulation 179A(2), on the date on which the applicant became entitled to receive it, but instead on whichever of the following occurs later: the date on which the applicant became entitled to receive it: the day after the date on which the applicant’s employment ceased (as that term is defined, in relation to a person’s employment, by Schedule 2 of the Act and regulation 3(2) of the principal regulations).

In this notice, a reference to a person increasing voting control is a reference to the person becoming the holder or controller of an increased percentage of the voting rights in a code company. If, under the terms of the offer in respect of which a person increases their voting control in reliance on this notice, 1 or more persons are allotted voting securities up to 2 months earlier than other persons, references in this notice to a control percentage or percentages immediately before the increase in voting control must be read as references to a control percentage or percentages immediately before the first allotment is made under the offer. Any term or expression that is defined in the Act, the Code, or the class notice and used, but not defined, in this notice has the same meaning as in the Act, the Code, or the class notice. Every person who, on or before 31 December 2020, increases their voting control as a result of an allotment of voting securities is exempted from rule 6(1) of the Code in respect of that increase in voting control. This clause applies— regardless of whether the person is a holder or controller of voting securities in the code company; and regardless of whether the allotment is made under an offer of voting securities that is made pro rata to all holders of a class of voting securities in the code company. The exemption in clause 5 is subject to the condition that, if the person’s aggregate control percentage immediately before the increase in the person’s voting control— is 20% or less, the person’s aggregate control percentage resulting from the allotment does not exceed 30%; or is more than 20%, the person’s aggregate control percentage resulting from the allotment does not exceed by more than 10% the person’s aggregate control percentage immediately before the allotment. See also the condition in clause 14. This clause applies if a code company makes an allotment of voting securities under an offer of voting securities that is made pro rata to all holders of a class of voting securities in the code company. Every person who, on or before 31 December 2020, increases their voting control as a result of the allotment is exempted from rule 6(1) of the Code in respect of that increase in voting control. This clause applies if a code company makes an allotment of voting securities under an offer of voting securities— that is made by a series of offers with accelerated features; but in all other respects, that is made pro rata to all holders of a class of voting securities in the code company. Every person who, on or before 31 December 2020, increases their voting control as a result of the allotment is exempted from rule 6(1) of the Code in respect of that increase in voting control. In this clause, accelerated features means 1 or more of the following is a feature of the offer that is made by the series of offers: it is made to 1 or more persons (earlier recipients) before it is made to other persons (later recipients): earlier recipients are given less time to accept the offer than is given to later recipients: its terms provide for 1 or more earlier recipients to be allotted voting securities on a date or dates up to 2 months earlier than the date for allotment of all other securities under the offer: under its terms, 1 or more (but not all) recipients may trade rights to be allotted the voting securities. This clause applies if a code company makes an allotment of voting securities under an offer that would be of the kind described in clause 7 or 8 except that— the offer is not made to 1 or more overseas shareholders; or the terms of the offer prevent 1 or more overseas shareholders from accepting their pro rata share of the rights or securities offered. Every person who, on or before 31 December 2020, increases their voting control as a result of the allotment is exempted from rule 6(1) of the Code in respect of that increase in voting control. However, the exemption in subclause (2) does not apply to an increase in voting control acquired as a result of the rights or voting securities sold by the NZX trading and advising firm or related company that is appointed as referred to in clause 11(1). In this clause and clause 11,— NZX trading and advising firm has the meaning set out in the NZX Participant Rules made by NZX Limited rights means rights to acquire voting securities. The exemptions in clauses 7 to 9 are subject to the condition that each person to whom the allotment of voting securities resulted in the increase, or part of the increase, in voting control (an allottee)— acquired no more than the allottee’s pro rata share of the securities offered; or if this paragraph applies, acquired on behalf of a beneficiary no more than the beneficiary’s pro rata share of the securities offered to the allottee. Subclause (1)﻿(b) applies if the allottee is a nominee company, bare trustee of a trust, or broker, acting for a beneficiary whose increase in voting control resulted in the allottee’s increase (or part of the allottee’s increase) in voting control. Subclause (1) does not apply to the extent that the allottee relies on an exemption in clause 5 or 12 (or both) to acquire voting securities in excess of their pro rata entitlement. See also the condition in clause 14. The exemption in clause 9 is also subject to the condition that, if the offer is renounceable, the terms of the offer must include statements to the following effect: that the code company— has appointed an NZX trading and advising firm, or a related company of an NZX trading and advising firm, to sell the relevant rights or the voting securities to which the relevant rights relate (with those sales being made as soon as practicable and consistent with the terms of the offer); and will ensure that each excluded overseas shareholder is paid that shareholder’s pro rata share of the net proceeds of those sales; and that, to the best of the code company’s knowledge, the appointed NZX trading and advising firm or the related company (as relevant) is not being prosecuted for any offence. In this clause,— relevant rights means, in respect of an offer, the aggregate pro rata share of rights or voting securities that the excluded overseas shareholders— would have been offered (in addition to, and not as a portion of, those rights or securities offered to the shareholders who received the offer) had the offer been of the kind described in clause 7 or 8; or are prevented from accepting by the terms of the offer renounceable means, in relation to a right or an offer of voting securities, a right or an offer of voting securities that is transferable (whether on or off-market) by the holder to another person (whether or not that person is an existing holder of any voting securities to which the right or offer relates). This clause applies if a code company makes an allotment of voting securities under an offer of voting securities of the kind described in clause 7, 8, or 9. Every person who, on or before 31 December 2020, increases their voting control as a result of the allotment is exempted from rule 6(1) of the Code in respect of that increase in voting control. The exemption in clause 12 is subject to the conditions that— the increase in voting control by the person (A) who relies on the exemption results from 1 or more of the following in connection with the offer of voting securities of the kind described in clause 7, 8, or 9: A acting as an underwriter under an underwriting contract: A acting as a subunderwriter under a subunderwriting contract: A being allocated voting securities under a shortfall bookbuild: A acquiring voting securities under an over-acceptance facility; and under the offer referred to in paragraph (a), the voting securities— have been offered to, and not taken up by, existing holders of voting securities; or were not offered to existing holders of voting securities who are excluded overseas shareholders. See also the condition in clause 14. The exemptions in clauses 5, 7, 8, 9, and 12 are subject to the condition that all of the requirements in clauses 15 to 20 are complied with. A person (A) who relies on 1 or more of the exemptions referred to in clause 14 must, before the close of the second anniversary of the first increase date (the 2-year date), decrease their control percentage to the extent necessary to meet the applicable threshold as follows: if A’s control percentage immediately before the first increase date was 20% or less, A’s control percentage must be decreased to, or below,—  30%; or a lesser amount that is required to comply with subclause (3): if A’s control percentage immediately before the first increase date was more than 20%, A’s control percentage must be decreased to, or below,— the percentage determined under subclause (2); or a lesser amount that is required to comply with subclause (3). The percentage under subclause (1)﻿(b)﻿(i) is the sum of the following: A’s control percentage immediately before the first increase date; plus 10%; plus an additional 5% if the sum of the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) is more than 50% (the creep allowance). A must do either or both of the following to the extent necessary to ensure that, before the close of the 2-year date, A’s aggregate control percentage does not exceed A’s aggregate control percentage immediately before the first increase date by more than the aggregate increase cap: decrease A’s control percentage: ensure that A’s associates decrease their control percentage.  Subclause (3) does not limit subclause (1). In this notice,— aggregate increase cap means,— if A’s aggregate control percentage immediately before the first increase date was 20% or less,— 10%; plus the amount (if any) by which A’s aggregate control percentage immediately before the first increase date was less than 20%; and 10% if— A’s aggregate control percentage immediately before the first increase date was more than 20%; and paragraph (c) does not apply; and 15% if— A’s aggregate control percentage immediately before the first increase date was more than 20%; and the creep allowance applies in relation to A or any of the persons who were A’s associates as at the first increase date; and only the person to which the creep allowance applies will retain the voting rights to which the creep allowance relates first increase date means the date of the first increase in A’s voting control in reliance on any of the exemptions referred to in clause 14. See clause 18(6), which relates to the adjustment of a control reduction requirement and the aggregate increase cap if there is an other-means increase during the restricted period (as those terms are defined in clause 17). Subclause (2) applies if a person (A) holds or controls voting rights that would be subject to a control reduction requirement under clause 15 (control reduction voting rights) if the 2-year date were to occur at that time. A must do either or both of the following to the extent necessary to ensure that A’s aggregate control percentage (that is actually exercised) does not exceed A’s aggregate control percentage immediately before the first increase date by more than the aggregate increase cap: A must not exercise the control reduction voting rights and must otherwise ensure that the control reduction voting rights are not exercised: A must ensure that each of its associates— does not exercise the control reduction voting rights that they hold; and otherwise ensures that the control reduction voting rights that the associate controls are not exercised. If a person holds or controls any voting rights in reliance on the creep allowance, that person must not exercise those voting rights until the first anniversary of the first increase date. See clause 18(6), which relates to the adjustment of a control reduction requirement and the aggregate increase cap if there is an other-means increase during the restricted period (as those terms are defined in clause 17). During the restricted period, a person who has increased their control percentage in a code company in reliance on this notice must not increase their voting control in the code company by way of an other-means increase unless— the other-means increase— is by an acquisition of voting securities approved in accordance with rule 7(c) of the Code; or is by an allotment of voting securities approved in accordance with rule 7(d) of the Code; or is permitted under rule 7(e) of the Code (subject to clause 19); or is permitted by an exemption granted by the Panel under section 45(1)﻿(a) or (b) of the Act; and the applicable requirements in clause 18 are complied with. During the restricted period, a person who has increased their control percentage in a code company in reliance on this notice must ensure that each current associate of the person does not increase their voting control in the code company by way of an other-means increase unless—  the other-means increase— is by an acquisition of voting securities approved in accordance with rule 7(c) of the Code; or is by an allotment of voting securities approved in accordance with rule 7(d) of the Code; or is permitted under rule 7(e) of the Code (subject to clause 19); or is permitted by an exemption granted by the Panel under section 45(1)﻿(a) or (b) of the Act; and the applicable requirements in clause 18 are complied with. In subclause (2), current associate of the person, at a particular time, means an associate of the person at that time. In this clause and clause 18,— other-means increase means an increase in voting control in the code company that is effected by a means other than in reliance on this notice restricted period means the period starting on the first increase date and ending on the close of the day on which the person who has relied on this notice has complied with their obligations under clause 15. If the approval of the code company’s shareholders is required under clause 17(1) or (2), the notice of meeting containing the resolution to approve the other-means increase must contain or be accompanied by the following: a summary of the terms of each COVID-19 exemption transaction and the reasons for entering into it; and a statement of the particulars specified in subclause (2); and a statement of the assumptions on which those particulars are based. The particulars are— the number and percentage of voting securities on issue that were allotted under the COVID-19 exemption transaction (or under each COVID-19 exemption transaction if there is more than 1)— to each person (A) who has increased their control percentage of the code company in reliance on this notice; and  to each of A’s associates: to A and those associates in aggregate; and to all persons in aggregate; and the total number of all voting securities on issue (as at the relevant date); and the number and percentage of all voting securities on issue (as at the relevant date) that are held or controlled— by each person, or associate, referred to in clause 17(1) or (2) (B) who will increase their voting control by way of the other-means increase; and by each of B’s associates; and by B and those associates in aggregate; and the number and percentage of all voting securities on issue (as at the relevant date) that are held or controlled by B, by each of B’s associates, and by B and those associates in aggregate and— that are subject to a control reduction requirement; and that are subject to voting restrictions under clause 16; and the maximum number and percentage of all voting securities on issue that would be held or controlled by B, by each of B’s associates, and by B and those associates in aggregate (calculated as if the voting securities were acquired or allotted under the approved other-means increase); and the maximum number and percentage of all voting securities on issue that would be held or controlled by B, by each of B’s associates, and by B and those associates in aggregate (calculated as if the voting securities were acquired or allotted under the approved other-means increase) and— that are subject to a control reduction requirement; and that are subject to voting restrictions under clause 16; and the maximum number and percentage of all voting securities on issue that would be held or controlled by B, by each of B’s associates, and by B and those associates in aggregate (calculated as if the voting securities were acquired or allotted under the approved other-means increase) and that would not be subject to either of the following:  a control reduction requirement: voting restrictions under clause 16. The reference to— A’s associates in subclause (2)﻿(a), is a reference to the persons who were A’s associates at the time that the voting securities were allotted under the COVID-19 exemption transaction: B’s associates in subclause (2)﻿(c) to (g), is a reference to the persons who were B’s associates on the relevant date. The information under subclause (2)﻿(d)﻿(ii), (f)﻿(ii), or (g)﻿(ii) must separately identify the voting securities (if any) that will cease to be subject to a voting restriction on the first anniversary of the first increase date. The information under subclause (2)﻿(f) and (g) must be calculated in a manner consistent with the adjustments under subclause (6). If an other-means increase is approved by shareholders in accordance with this clause,— the applicable threshold under clause 15(1) must be adjusted to take account of the other-means increase; and the references in  clauses 15 and 16 to a control reduction requirement, the aggregate increase cap, or control reduction voting rights must be taken to be a reference to a control reduction requirement, the aggregate increase cap, or control reduction voting rights adjusted to take account of the other-means increase. In this clause,— COVID-19 exemption transaction, in relation to a person who will increase their voting control by way of the other-means increase, means a transaction under which the person (or the person’s associate) increased their control percentage in the code company in reliance on this notice relevant date means— the date of the notice of meeting; or the date that is as close as is reasonably practicable to the date of the notice of meeting so as to enable the information under subclause (2) to be determined. If a person increases their control percentage in reliance on this notice by 10% or more, they must not increase their control percentage in reliance on rule 7(e) of the Code until after the first anniversary of the first increase date. A person must not increase their control percentage in reliance on this notice to become a dominant owner (within the meaning of rule 50 of the Code). Every person who is, or is an upstream party of, a professional underwriter is exempted from rule 6(1) of the Code in respect of any increase in the person’s voting control in a code company that occurs on or before 31 December 2020. In this clause and clause 22,— additional voting rights, in relation to any person who has increased voting control, means the portion of the voting rights in a code company held or controlled by the person that corresponds to the person’s increase in voting control professional underwriter means a person whose ordinary business includes entering into underwriting or subunderwriting contracts upstream party, in relation to a person, means any other person who directly or indirectly has effective control over the person. The exemption in clause 21 is subject to the conditions that— the increase in voting control results from 1 or more of the following in connection with an offer of voting securities of the kind described in clause 7, 8, or 9: the professional underwriter acting as an underwriter under an underwriting contract: the professional underwriter acting as a subunderwriter under a subunderwriting contract: the professional underwriter being allocated voting securities under a shortfall bookbuild; and under the offer referred to in paragraph (a), the voting securities— have been offered to, and not taken up by, existing holders of voting securities; or were not offered to existing holders of voting securities who are excluded overseas shareholders; and the professional underwriter acts under paragraph (a) in the professional underwriter’s ordinary course of business; and the purpose of the professional underwriter acting under paragraph (a) is to earn fees, commission, or similar remuneration; and neither the professional underwriter nor any upstream party or associate of the professional underwriter had a collateral purpose or intention, in respect of the professional underwriter acting under paragraph (a), of enabling any or all of the following persons to increase their control percentage: the professional underwriter: the upstream parties of the professional underwriter: the associates of the professional underwriter; and immediately before the professional underwriter increases their voting control under paragraph (a), the aggregate control percentage of the person who relies on the exemption does not exceed 20%; and the aggregate control percentage of the person who relies on the exemption is decreased on or before the second anniversary of the date of the increase in the person’s voting control so that their aggregate control percentage does not exceed 20%; and the additional voting rights of that person are not exercised before the decrease of the person’s aggregate control percentage required by paragraph (g); and all of the requirements in clauses 19 and 20 are complied with. Note: The following statement of reasons should be read in conjunction with the statement(s) of reasons appended to the: Takeovers Code (Facilitation of Capital Raising in Response to COVID-19) Exemption Amendment Notice 2020 This notice applies to acts or omissions occurring on or after 10 April 2020 and is revoked on the close of 31 October 2022. The Takeovers Panel (the Panel) has granted in this notice exemptions for classes of persons, transactions, and offers from compliance with rule 6(1) of the Takeovers Code (the Code). The terms and conditions of the exemptions are designed to ensure that the underlying purpose and intent of the Code are fulfilled while also allowing code companies to access sufficient equity capital urgently should the need arise. COVID-19 has been causing significant issues with the economy and a number of companies have come, or are expected to come, under pressure because of rapidly changing economic conditions. While the usual balance that the Code strikes among the objectives of the Code is appropriate in ordinary circumstances, the effects of COVID-19 have caused the appropriate balance to shift. Specifically, given the financial strain that companies are experiencing or are likely to experience, it is appropriate to temporarily refocus the balance between the objectives of the Code in favour of facilitating access to capital. Generally speaking,— control of a code company can be increased under this notice without a sell down requirement: that increase in control is immediate, but is subject to a cap (generally of 10% more than the person would be entitled to under the Code): control can be increased beyond the cap, but it is subject to a requirement to reduce control and voting restrictions. The exemption in clause 5 permits increases in voting control of, by and large, up to 10% above the limits imposed by the fundamental rule in rule 6 of the Code. This exemption is consistent with the objectives of the Code in that it will encourage the efficient allocation of resources, to ensure that capital finds its way to companies that are in significant need during the outbreak of COVID-19. The exemptions in clauses 7 to 9  are based on clauses 8 to 8B of the Takeovers Code (Class Exemptions) Notice (No 2) 2001 (but with modified conditions). They will avoid inadvertent breaches by shareholders that take up their pro rata allotment. The exemptions are consistent with the principle of providing equal consideration to all shareholders of the same class. The exemptions are consistent with the objectives of the Code because the attaching conditions require that a portion of the increase in voting control may need to be eliminated within 2 years of the increase and that the voting rights of that portion are not exercised before that elimination. The exemption in clause 21 is based on that in the Takeovers Code (Professional Underwriters) Exemption Notice 2004. It does not apply to corporate investors who seek to use underwriting agreements as a means of increasing control in code companies. The Panel considers that it is appropriate to grant exemptions to professional underwriters, and upstream parties of professional underwriters, from rule 6(1) of the Code because underwriting arrangements are an accepted means of assisting companies to raise capital in New Zealand, which should be facilitated by the Panel, and the allotments pursuant to the underwriting agreements to which the exemption applies would not change the effective control of the code company. The new exemptions apply only to increases in voting control on or before 31 October 2020. Accordingly, the Panel considers that it is appropriate and consistent with the objectives of the Code to grant the exemptions because— the exemptions relate only to allotments of voting securities. They do not permit acquisitions that would exceed restrictions in the Code: the ability to increase effective voting control is generally capped at 10% (there is an ability to increase voting control beyond the cap but see the following bullet point regarding such increases): to the extent that a person would increase voting control by more than the cap, the conditions provide that such voting control must not be exercised and such voting control must be eliminated within a 2-year period: the usual sell down and voting restriction periods of 6 months (for professional underwriters) and 12 months (for shareholders) are not appropriate at this time given the level of volatility in the market. As such, the conditions retain the existing substantive protections but have adapted those protections for current market circumstances: the exemptions maintain a proper balance between the costs of compliance with the Code and the benefits resulting from it: the exemptions are temporary and will encourage the efficient allocation of resources by helping to facilitate legitimate capital raising in an extremely unusual situation: assisting companies to survive extreme economic pressures will help to maintain the competitiveness of New Zealand’s capital markets.

2020-10-27T14:30:30,Takeovers Code (Facilitation of Capital Raising in Response to COVID-19) Exemption Amendment Notice 2020," Pursuant to section 45 of the Takeovers Act 1993, the Takeovers Panel, being satisfied of the matters set out in section 45(6) of that Act, gives the following notice. This notice is the Takeovers Code (Facilitation of Capital Raising in Response to COVID-19) Exemption Amendment Notice 2020. This notice comes into force on 26 October 2020. This notice amends the Takeovers Code (Facilitation of Capital Raising in Response to COVID-19) Exemption Notice 2020 (the principal notice). In clause 3, replace “31 October 2022” with “31 December 2022”. In clause 5(1), replace “31 October 2020” with “31 December 2020”. In clause 7(2), replace “31 October 2020” with “31 December 2020”. In clause 8(2), replace “31 October 2020” with “31 December 2020”. In clause 9(2), replace “31 October 2020” with “31 December 2020”. In clause 12(2), replace “31 October 2020” with “31 December 2020”. In clause 21(1), replace “31 October 2020” with “31 December 2020”. This notice, which comes into force on 26 October 2020, amends the Takeovers Code (Facilitation of Capital Raising in Response to COVID-19) Exemption Notice 2020 (the principal notice). The principal notice granted exemptions for classes of persons, transactions, and offers from compliance with rule 6(1) of the Takeovers Code (the Code). The exemptions were granted in response to COVID-19 and the significant issues it had been causing for the economy and the pressure a number of companies were under (or were expected to come under) due to rapidly changing economic conditions. The terms and conditions of the exemptions were designed to ensure that the underlying purpose and intent of the Code were fulfilled while also allowing code companies to access sufficient equity capital urgently should the need arise. Under the principal notice, generally speaking,— control of a code company can be increased without a sell down requirement: that increase in control is immediate, but is subject to a cap (generally of 10% more than the person would be entitled to under the Code): control can be increased beyond the cap, but it is subject to a requirement to reduce control and voting restrictions. However, the exemptions in the principal notice apply only to increases in voting control that occur on or before 31 October 2020. This notice extends the application of the exemptions to increases in voting control occurring on or before 31 December 2020. It also extends the revocation date of the principal notice from 31 October 2022 to 31 December 2022. This is to ensure that the notice will remain in force for 2 years after the last date on which the exemptions can be relied on, in order to align with the exemption conditions in clauses 15 to 18. The Takeovers Panel considers it appropriate to amend the principal notice in this way because COVID-19 continues to significantly disrupt the economy in an unprecedented manner and has placed a significant number of companies under significant and highly irregular strain. Further difficulties may also arise as government support programmes are phased out. The Panel considers the amendment to be consistent with the objectives of the Code because— the duration of the extension, being 2 months, is relatively short: the exemptions relate only to allotments of voting securities. They do not permit acquisitions that would exceed restrictions in the Code: the ability to increase effective voting control is generally capped at 10% (there is an ability to increase voting control beyond the cap, but see the following bullet point regarding such increases): to the extent that a person would increase voting control by more than the cap, the conditions provide that such voting control must not be exercised and such voting control must be eliminated within the 2-year period specified in the principal notice: the usual sell down and voting restriction periods of 6 months (for professional underwriters) and 12 months (for shareholders) are not appropriate at this time given the level of volatility that continues to exist in the market. As such, the conditions retain the existing substantive protections but have adapted those protections for current market circumstances: the exemptions maintain a proper balance between the costs of compliance with the Code and the benefits resulting from it: the exemptions are temporary and will encourage the efficient allocation of resources by helping to facilitate legitimate capital raising in what continues to be an extremely unusual situation: assisting companies to survive extreme economic pressures will help to maintain the competitiveness of New Zealand’s capital markets.",http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2020/0278/latest/whole.html
