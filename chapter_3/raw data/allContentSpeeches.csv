My special thanks to Business New Zealand and also to Beca as our hosts.I’m very aware that I’m speaking with you at a time when New Zealand feels like a calm oasis in a chaotic and difficult world.Yesterday, like many of you, I watched the results of the US election roll in, and I couldn’t help but reflect on our own elections in recent years.No matter where you sit on the political spectrum, I’d like to think we can agree that a strong democracy requires a few pre conditions.Citizens that believe in their system, and participate in it. Political parties that believe and support the system too.  And, perhaps this last point is a little more debateable, but I’ve increasingly come to believe that we have to find ways that strong views can be held, and expressed, but without the accompanying partisanship that stops us from working to build consensus where it really matters.We are living in an increasingly divided world. There are many people out there who could no doubt provide a range of evidence based theories as to why that is the case.  From where I sit it feels as though we have a borderless world for things like trade and the exchange of people and skills, and yet, rather than this leading to people being exposed to new and different ideas and ways of thinking, the advent of technology and the creation of online platforms has led us instead to find and build our tribes to entrench our existing views. Places where we can lock in our opinions, where we can further reinforce them, rather than allow ourselves to be questioned and have our perspectives tested.The emergence of a global pandemic over the course of the past year has undoubtedly exacerbated these issues.  There is no question that there are certain facts about a pandemic that are just that – facts.Where the debate exists is the space between those facts, and the strategy a country and its leaders choose to deploy in the face of them.There are legitimate choices to be made. Priorities to be decided upon. In New Zealand’s case, we made our choices. They were based on the make-up of our population, some of the unique advantages we have – not least our border, and our perspective that there is no cost free option, but by forgoing some freedoms, namely the free movement at our borders, we retain the long term health of our population and the open economy we now enjoy.It was a choice, but one that I strongly believe has served us well, and that New Zealanders have for the most part, supported. That support has also been key. And the importance of consensus building has only been reinforced for me as a leader through this experience.And while we are in the midst of this ongoing crisis, and will be for some time, there are encouraging signs that reinforce the choices we’ve made.The unemployment figures yesterday at 5.3% is well below the more than 9% prediction we faced at the budget, and puts us below Australia at 6.9% and the OECD average of 7.4%.Merchandise exports since 1 February were higher than in 2019, and up 5% from 2018. We also saw expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors in September and consumer and business confidence both improved in October.But like you, we are all too aware that we will not be spared the ongoing effects of this global pandemic.Covid 19 is raging in Europe. We are seeing levels of infection not seen since the first wave, and the return of lockdowns in many places. Sweden has announced social gathering limits and sometime ago asked its population to prepare to work from home for 6 months.The UK, Germany, France and other parts of Europe are under restrictions again.  It is unquestionably tough out there. And while that is the case, it will be tough here too.In fact the coming years will be very difficult with the global growth forecasts showing the impact of the virus is going to be with New Zealand for some time - both in terms of managing its spread but also recovering from its economic impact.That’s why we need and have a strong plan. One that preserves our hard won position, makes the most of the opportunities that do exist, and, very importantly, one that brings people with us.Let me start with preserving our position.Many of you will have heard on Monday that I have very deliberately constructed a Cabinet around two overarching priorities: to continue our health response to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19, and to drive our economic recovery and ensure we take the opportunity we have in front of us to build back better.The new line-up has a greater coordination around the management of each – with both an enhanced and co-ordinated health team, making use of the talent we have in our caucus, and a senior and co-ordinated economic team, many of whom are here today.The health team are rightly focused on the biggest risk to our current position, and that is our border. This is a large and complex operation. In fact on a per capita basis our quarantine capacity is larger than Australia’s, with up to 6,000 people in facilities at any given time. We have a work force of 4000 people including up to 1000 health staff as well as our military and police monitoring security.It requires rigorous infection controls, and daily health checks of staff as well as regular testing. Few other countries are even attempting to stop Covid at the border in this way and in the main it is working.But there is also no fool proof, error free way of managing a virus.  It is tricky, and requires layers of back up for the occasions when it may infect those working in high risk situations. We have built those layers, and they are serving us well. Recent transmission of the virus at the border for instance, has been picked up early, ring-fenced and prevented from spreading.But ongoing vigilance is absolutely key. Every single day.Then there is the complex exercise of managing the flow of people.We have both scheduled and charter flights coming into New Zealand carrying citizens and permanent residents. Forward planning under these circumstances was difficult, making it extraordinarily hard to effectively and efficiently use excess capacity for essential workers when it was so difficult to anticipate demand from citizens.From the 3rd of November we have required all returnees to have a voucher for managed isolation facilities. This enables us to plan ahead, match demand and capacity, and put in place our quota system for essential workers.We want to find a balance here between bringing in more workers essential to our economic recovery and ensuring there is space for New Zealanders wanting to return home to do so - and I should note that as you can imagine, demand is high and at some points, at capacity in the lead up to Christmas. Kiwis understandably want to come home.In the meantime, a persistent question that has come from the private sector has been whether we will open up managed isolation to private provision. I understand the call for extra capacity.  And I am certainly not arguing that the only ones capable of managing a facility is a government agency. However, there are some basic provisions that we have to have in order to make quarantine work. These provisions are not limitless in their availability. Health staff and law enforcement are amongst them.  Every health worker we remove from the system, places pressure elsewhere.  So let’s keep the conversation on our borders going, but while remembering that they are key to our success.That then brings me to the second tranche of our response, focused on our economic recovery.Here within the cabinet line-up you will have noted the appointment of Grant Robertson as Deputy Prime Minister, and also the addition of Infrastructure Minister to his portfolios.He is joined by David Parker and Megan Woods as Associate Finance Ministers. These are very deliberate appointments, with David focused on RMA reform and Megan in the energy space, both key to our recovery and the opportunities that lie in front of us.Michael Wood joins the team in the transport space, and Stuart Nash, well known to many of you for his work in small business, picks up Economic and Regional Development and tourism. Damien O’Connor takes over Trade. Growing our exports is a key plank in our recovery and with Damien retaining Agriculture there will be key synergies in his portfolios.It’s a strong team, with a strong plan that we started to roll out before the election, and will now look to speed up.Many of you will recall the foundation of that plan1) Investing in our people2) Job creation3) Preparing for the future4) Supporting small business5) Backing our exportersI now want to set out the key areas of priority for the Government before Christmas.From our perspective, and I know yours, there is no time to lose.The first item of business when the new Cabinet meets on Monday will be making improvements to the small business loan scheme to provide ongoing support as we rebuild from Covid.The scheme was originally intended as a stop gap. It provided access to finance for vulnerable but viable businesses who needed support to cover costs in the wake of lock downs and the impact of COVID.We have to acknowledge though, that the uncertainty that COVID has created will be with us for some time to come. For a sector that makes up 97 percent of all enterprises and approximately 29 percent of all employees, we want to play a greater role in countering that instability through access to capital.That is why we will be taking a proposal to cabinet on Monday that proposes extending the Scheme for three years; extend the interest free period from one year to two years.Later in November Ministers will bring further proposals forward to enable the scheme to be used for a broader range of purposes, such as investing in new equipment or digital infrastructure. This is aimed at supporting small businesses to adapt to COVID-19, innovate in their business, supports jobs and ensure they keep going in any tough times to come.But I also want us to take up the challenge that has been extended to us by the small business council and commence work on new ways to support small businesses with finance, such as the proposed Small Business Growth Fund, repurposing the Small Business Cashflow Loan Scheme, establishing a micro-finance company for small businesses, or expanding the mandate of the Venture Investment Fund. We need to find long term solutions to a problem that actually existed before COVID arrived on our door step.The second priority is to get the flexi-wage scheme up and running by the end of the year.While the unemployment figures released yesterday were lower than many had predicted, the disproportionate impact of job losses on Maori, Pacific and woman is undeniable.It’s our view that we must tackle employment from both angles – through job creation such as infrastructure investment, our jobs for nature programme, and our free training opportunities. But we also have a role to play in supporting employers to take on employees also.The flexi-wage is a wage subsidy programme that assists employers to hire people who are at risk of long-term unemployment and receiving a benefit. The subsidy is targeted and flexible, commensurate to the type of business or the needs of the person being employed. We will boost investment in the flexi-wage programme through an additional $311 million of funding to increase the average subsidy paid to businesses and enable up to an additional 40,000 unemployed people to take advantage of the programme. Policy details will go to Cabinet before Christmas, and we will start rolling out the additional funding this year.Part of our flexi-wage proposals also include $30m being ring fenced to support out of work kiwis to help start a business through an expanded Flexi-wage Self Employment programme. This will provide the same amount a business would receive for an employee subsidy to assist starting their own business.Ultimately, by building on a proven programme we are able to offer additional support to struggling businesses and create a strong incentive to employ those who are most affected by the economic recession. It’s a win-win and one we are keen to get going with, and promote to employers.We know these types of employer focused programmes make a difference. In the early stages of our COVID response we focused heavily on retaining and growing apprenticeships. A comprehensive $519.8 million support package was launched for apprentices and their employers, and this has been essential to ensure that the jobs of existing apprentices are secure and that new apprentices are able to start training through our COVID recovery.I can share today (for the first time) that as of 2 November one part of that package, the Apprenticeship Boost Initiative has seen payments made to 5,219 employers to take on 11,455 apprentices. The thousands of New Zealanders taking up trades will help form the critical workforce needed to deliver the $42 billion earmarked for infrastructure projects over the coming years.In addition, since we introduced free trades training and apprenticeships on 1 July we have seen 6791 new apprentices sign up in the building and constructions sector alone, 4000 more than in the same time period last year.These are policies that are delivering and I encourage anyone here who can take on apprentices to do so, and to share the message that anyone wanting to retrain should consider signing up for free trades training and become part of the workforce to help New Zealand build back better.I can also announce today that we will continue to approve fast tracked RMA projects this year. Cabinet will consider additional projects to go through the fast-track process before Christmas and will be announced in due course. The first project has already been approved by the fast track panel and we expect to refer additional projects to panels within the next two weeks.The wider work on RMA reform is a priority this term. There will be change. David Parker is progressing this work and we intend to make this a priority for the first half of 2021.Over the next term we will also have a particular focus on sustainability, and pursuing carbon neutrality. If we are going to ask the private sector to reduce emissions we know as a public service we need to get our own house in order too, and at the same time continue to pursue large scale projects that will pay dividends in multiple ways – this includes work on the business case to shift to 100% renewable electricity, work on our hydrogen road map with a focus on domestic freight use and as a potential export market, and exploring the potential opportunities created by biofuels. All of this creates efficiencies for us, addresses our international obligations, but also creates an opportunity to trade on our clean, green status with authenticity.Our climate status has the potential to be an economic golden ticket for our products, if we get it right.But this is just one opportunity that lies in front of us as we rebuild. I am utterly convinced that one of the others is in the digital space.On Monday we very deliberately created the role of Minister for the Digital Economy and Communications, which will be held by Dr David Clark. This will pull together many currently separated strands of work – the digital divide, issues around rural access to digital technologies right through to the digitisation of the public service.But more than that. I see this role as an excellent opportunity to help us respond to COVID-19 and to position ourselves in the future.The total global e-commerce market was estimated to be worth US$7.7 trillion in 2018, including both the retail and business to business market.Already our technology sector is New Zealand's third largest exporter, with ICT alone representing $6.7 billion worth of revenue in 2019 and COVID has shown the role it can play in our recovery and in working in a more remote fashion.I see this ministerial delegation supporting the rollout of new technology across New Zealand and creating a digital strategy for Aotearoa. To help do this the Minister will create a Digital Ministers Group that will focus on:  connectivity, economic benefits of digitalisation and e-commerce, data, digital skills and inclusion.We have the ability and opportunity to be a truly digital nation, but we have a lot of work to do to get there. I’m committed to making improvements and gains in this area this term, and I am very much looking forward to working with all of you on that goal.In fact, I anticipate a busy period for collaborative work over the coming months in many other respects.Prior to the election, we signalled our view that we needed reform of our sick leave provisions.  Making sure that workers are well supported to stay home when they are unwell is an important part of our COVID response, and in our view, the current provision of 5 days is not sufficient.During the election we proposed a shift to the same level of sick pay as Australia, with 10 days. We know there are issues to be worked through on some of the wider implementation. We are committed to working through those questions together. That’s why cabinet will consider draft legislation before Christmas, with a plan to introduce this in the house before the end of the year, but then move to a full select committee process so we can try and build some consensus around this issue. Michael Wood will lead this process for us, and I know is keen to build on the good relationships we already have with Business NZ.So as you can see our priorities through to the end of the year are about what is most urgent, and that is supporting jobs and business through the small business loan scheme, getting the flexi-wage scheme up and running and continuing to promote enrolment in free trades training and apprenticeships. We are also getting infrastructure projects moving with more projects to go through the fast-track process.In the meantime we will be continuing with our existing border settings for now, while we work on what can be accommodated within those settings. New Zealanders want and deserve a safe summer holiday, so our focus is on managing the existing risk profile.    But our response does not end there. In fact it is only the beginning. We have a constant eye to the future. To the time when we can expect to see a change in the COVID landscape we are currently operating in. Our vaccine strategy is rolling out well. We have advanced purchase arrangements with Pfizer and BioNTech and are in negotiations with a number of others.  Based on current predictions, roll out of different vaccinations is likely to begin in earnest next year, albeit with some varying estimates around which quarter.When we are in a position to change our border settings, a trade mission will be on the top of my list. I have already asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade for advice around leading a delegation into several key markets, including Europe and the UK where we have already begun negotiations on critical free trade agreements as well as China and the US.In the meantime, we are continuing with concluding other trade agreements like RCEP, which I expect announcements around soon. This represents the largest FTA in the world (along with CPTPP)  While it may not give us any new access, it will provide a single rule book covering 14 markets, which will significantly reduce complexity for exporters.  In fact the economic benefit of RCEP is likely to exceed $2b. It is forecast to add over $400b to the world economy and shift global economic activity towards East Asia, and will support New Zealand’s COVID recovery, especially since East Asia is forecast to recover more quickly than Europe and America.RCEP demonstrates that while getting our borders open again will be important, we can continue to further our interests in the current environment. And we will.To conclude, I want to expand just a little bit on something I said on election night, approximately a lifetime ago.I said we will govern for all New Zealanders and to reach as wide a consensus on key issues as possible. And I said that very deliberately.  Yes we have been humbled by such a strong mandate, but in my mind, that mandate was both endorsement of what we have done and plan to do, as it was about the way we do things.Yes, we will from time to time have different opinions. We may disagree on strategies or goals, but so long as we are able to continue our dialogue, recognise that we have the same ambition for New Zealand, we will find a way through difficult situations and challenges in a way that will stand us in good stead for the future.That is my commitment to you.In the meantime, let’s crack on with it."
2020-10-09T22:08:50Z,                                                                                                                    Hon David Parker                    ,  New Approaches to Economic Challenges: Confronting Planetary Emergencies: OECD 9 October 2020 ,"Hon David Parker’s response following Thomas Piketty and Esther Duflo.Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening, wherever in the world you might be. I first acknowledge the excellent thought provoking speeches of Thomas Piketty and Esther Duflo, and thank the OECD secretariat for the opportunity to respond today to two such thoughtful and influential thinkers. A few years ago, I spent a very pleasant summer holiday reading Capital in the 21st Century, thoroughly. I claim to be a Picketty 1%er, not because of my all-too-modest wealth, but because I read all the footnotes.  I am a disciple, and accept that over recent decades - and on current trends into the future – both western and eastern forms of capitalism are causing ever increasing wealth inequality, with more and more of that wealth being inherited by accident of birth rather than earned. COVID-19 has required all parts of society to cooperate in social distancing, testing, track and tracing.  It has required leadership from governments, not just in health but via income supports, and economic stimulus to help sustain and rebuild economic activity. COVID has shown us that social cohesion, trust and cooperation are essential ingredients to overcoming complex challenges. My Prime Minister would say kindness underpins them all.Rampant inequality is unkind and undermines our efforts to address complex problems. Accelerating climate change, rising inequality, and technological disruptions, were all formidable challenges own before COVID. They interact, amplifying bad outcomes. COVID-19 adds to these challenges but also provides an opportunity within countries and multilaterally to address them. The seriousness of the economic effects of the current crisis are being compared to the state of the world after the great depression and World War Two. Looking back, it is easy to make the mistake of seeing the post war Keynesian accommodation between capital and labour, the fundamental changes to monetary policy at Bretton Woods, the Marshall plan, the new institutions like the OECD, the 1948 General agreement on trade and tarrifs (which preceded the WTO), and the United Nations as some grand plan that was preordained. It was not like that. After years of poor international cooperation and war, our predecessors worked it out as they went.  They too lived in a time when people had made sacrifices for each other, and understood the need to cooperate nationally and internationally to help everyone, including themselves.  Perhaps we are at another point in history, where good leaders will lead well. I hope so because global cooperation is needed to overcome the many challenges that face our world. This is not to deny the importance and power of the single state responses. Awaiting multilateral solutions is currently more often than not a barren exercise. It can also be an excuse for inaction at home. We know that action within countries matters. Inequality has been rising within and across most countries but at different speeds, proving that institutions and policies matter and can moderate or exacerbate inequality. The different progress countries have made on controlling climate changing emissions illustrates the same point. So I will describe some of New Zealand’s national response before returning to suggestions where I believe multilateral efforts should focus. The New Zealand Government’s response to COVID has been to cushion the blow and to maintain the social contract needed to overcome the virus.  We had an early and very strict lockdown. Our wage subsidy scheme was aimed at keeping workers attached to their workplaces. It was a simple scheme and we got the money out very quickly. At its peak, two thirds of the labour force was supported by the subsidy.  It worked and people remained connected with their employment even during lockdown. Unemployment has risen less than was predicted. For those who did lose their jobs, a new COVID-19 relief payment provides support while they search for work. And we have boosted funding to training and education to help individuals to retrain and upskill themselves. We have provided significant fiscal stimulus, with a strong focus on improving infrastructure, to kick start the recovery.  In many ways our response has been an extension of our efforts as a government. When our new government took office in late 2017 we faced a set of complex problems, including: child poverty; housing unaffordability; climate change, deteriorating water quality.  The digital transformation, while holding great potential, also threatened to change the future of work in ways that exacerbate inequality. We have broadened the definition of progress beyond GDP and developed new and more comprehensive measures of success.  Led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has publicly declared that policies will be grounded in kindness and compassion, our Government introduced the country’s first Wellbeing Budget in May 2019. It had a strong focus on intergenerational well-being, which resulted in the weighting of government programmes towards income sufficiency for children, housing, mental health, climate change and fresh water. We have also taken local steps to push against the worst excesses of global capitalism, by introducing a ban on foreign buyers of existing homes. This has ensured the market in real estate is set on the domestic market, not by 1 percenters living overseas.  The Government has implemented a number of programmes to ameliorate income inequality in New Zealand:We increased the minimum wage, which was already high relative to median wages in New Zealand compared to other OECD countries.We funded a Families Package weighted towards low income families.We indexed benefits to average wage increases rather than inflation.We invested in state-funded health and education infrastructure and services.The OECD in its most recent Economic Update recommended that governments invest now in helping people keep or find new jobs, and in the environment. We are following that advice.   The COVID-19 recovery is a unique chance to address climate change.  If countries do not integrate climate change into recovery stimulus now, they lock themselves into a high emissions pathway.   That would increase the burden on future generations, who will bear the environmental debt as well as the financial debt we are incurring now.   Our post COVID Budget included a significant Jobs for Nature programme. It will provide jobs over four years, bringing improvements to freshwater, biosecurity, and biodiversity.    New Zealand is pushing faster towards 100% renewable electricity by 2030, having already achieved 82% through sustained effort and good policy.   We will be investing in a network of hydrogen refuelling stations for the heavy transport fleet – again creating jobs and supporting the green hydrogen vision that capitalises on New Zealand’s renewable energy.   Returning to multilateral themes, if we compare current challenges with the post war period we see many similarities, plus a newer suite of environmental issues ranging from climate change to fresh water quality, plastic waste and over fishing. First the similarities. Both times were dealing with the effects of globalisation. Not much difference there. Monetary policy was in a state of flux in the 1930s and 40s. This is another similarity with now, given that pre COVID quantitative easing had already collapsed global interest rates to close to zero, and pumped up the asset prices of those who hold and leverage them.  The world went into the COVID recession without the ability to use the central monetary tool of substantially lower interest rates to stimulate activity.    After the GFC New Zealand resisted QE, but this year in the face of COVID - with imported interest rates already at historic lows - our central bank joined the QE party.  So house prices are increasing again despite the Covid crisis and the impact of the lock down on employment and growth.  This is not new. Since the GFC the wealthy have been able to leverage their investments at very low interest rates. This has been to the relative detriment of the young, and those without assets.  There is a problem with this status quo around the world and we need a conversation about what the remedy might be. Income inequality was another problem then and now. Figures from the APEC grouping of 21 Pacific Rim economies also show that the share of GDP going to labour has steadily declined since the 1990s.  The impact of COVID-19 in New Zealand on incomes has, as elsewhere, fallen disproportionately. Workers in the hardest hit sectors of the economy - tourism and hospitality - tend to be lower paid, part-time, female, and younger.  Internationally, the labour share of GDP will continue to drop if we replicate the approach we took to the GFC in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Current wealth inequality shows the compound effects of income inequality. In 2018 in New Zealand the top 10 per cent of households held over half (53%) of household wealth, and the top 1 per cent held 16 per cent of wealth (Stats NZ).  But as Piketty has identified, these official measures of wealth inequality at the top are imperfect. They poorly sample the super-wealthy. They don’t capture all the investment vehicles and trusts that they use. Assets are sometimes reported at historic cost rather than current values.   This bias towards under-reporting wealth at the top means that wealth inequality is worse than reported. This is another similarity with the past.  The problem of wealth inequality was fresh in the minds of our predecessors in the 1940s, who had suffered the extremes of the 1920s and 30s and the war which followed. Back then trade was seen as a force for good, and should be seen that way now. We currently risk a descent into trade wars and barriers that will harm us all. While New Zealand has long advocated internationally for open trade, by 2017 we too were seeing increasing public scepticism at home.  Our response, borrowing the language already used by the EU, was our Trade for All agenda.  It aims to ensure the benefits of trade flow – and are seen to flow – to all sectors including small and medium businesses, indigenous Maori, women and the regions.  It has increased the social licence in favour of trade by showing its positive contribution to the issues people care about: jobs, communities and the environment.  A good example is using trade policy to address environmentally harmful subsidies – including for fisheries and for fossil fuel production and consumption.  They are costly and often socially regressive and make climate change worse. Fossil fuel subsidies cost US$582bn in 2019. Those public funds could be used for recovery efforts.  New Zealand is negotiating a plurilateral Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability, with legally enforceable disciplines for fossil fuel subsidies. Taxing Multinationals in the Digital EconomyAnother priority for the Government has been making sure that multinationals pay their fair share of tax.  Countries have taken some good steps to counter tax avoidance by multinationals. We have implemented the key Base Erosion and Profit Shifting measures. While the BEPS project shut down some artificial tax avoidance strategies, digital multinationals can still avoid paying a fair amount of tax. This is mostly due to flaws in the current international income tax framework. An OECD led international solution is preferred by the New Zealand government over a Digital Services Tax (DST).  However, the Government will seriously consider a DST if the OECD is unable to reach a solution. So, I would say we the politicians in this room should encourage the OECD and other multilateral to address:Income inequalityWealth inequalityMonetary policyThe benefits of tradeFair international taxation for digital servicesEnvironmental issues, including practical measures to reform fish subsidies and fossil fuel subsidies  And lastly, what duties should be owed by social media companies who are carrying messages of hate and misinformation, and undermining trust in liberal democracies.  We should seize the opportunities thrust upon us by COVID, and if we do we will all be better off. ENDS"
2020-08-26T02:28:53Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Nanaia Mahuta                    ,  Speech to the Stormwater Conference ,"Thank you for the invitation to deliver the keynote address to this year’s Stormwater conference.I like you had planned to be in Tauranga but we are taking the opportunity that online platforms create due to the uncertainties we are currently facing with Covid-19 and which prevent us meeting in person. Let me first acknowledge Water New Zealand and the event sponsors who have made it possible for us to be here today.I’d also like to acknowledge and welcome Gillian Blythe as the new Chief Executive of Water New Zealand. I congratulate you on your appointment and look forward to working with you. This year has seen unprecedented challenges for the country, for central government, for local government, for all our communities.As we’ve seen with the recent outbreaks of community transmission, COVID-19 has and will continue to have implications for our health, economy, and wellbeing. Looking at the big picture – the Government has faced this Pandemic without a playbook but we have a plan to get us through this current resurgence and that plan has 5 key planks.We are investing in people – The PM has made it very clear that the best economic response is a health response. As we continue to invest in the health system and a community response we remain focussed on workforce resilience and continue to invest in skills training in sectors and industries that position our people to be a part of the economic recovery. Our Second and third planks are jobs and infrastructure. We are committed to job creation and a productive economy where the Government can be a significant enabler of employment. We are changing gear to give greater certainty in how the Government will leverage its balance sheet to invest in infrastructure that will support regional and local economies.We have earmarked $3 billion for ‘shovel ready’ infrastructure projects. We established the Infrastructure Reference Group to work with local councils and businesses to identify a pipeline of projects to support the economy during the COVID-19 rebuild. Cabinet then decided the key sectors and regional breakdown of funds with more than 150 projects worth $2.6 billion being approved in principal. I will speak in more detail on water infrastructure later.We are also looking to the future. We are spending $1.3 billion on a range of Environment projects from enhancing biodiversity to pest control.Fourthly we are backing small business. We are mindful that as a small country the resilience of our local economies rely on the sustainability of the SME sector from local tradespeople, to emerging new business in the digital tech community, to tourism operators and those in professional services, food and hospitality.We are working alongside SMEs to support the critical issues of sustainable viability in this new context.  The wage subsidy scheme, various tax changes the BF6 scheme via the Regional Business Partnership as well as targeted support the Tourism industry are designed to help the SME sector.Fifthly we are positioning ourselves globally for when Covid is a lesser threat we can trade in sectors where there is continued trust and confidence in what we export and the value we put on being one of the best countries to trade with. As that trust and confidence grows in line with the Covid-19 response that will see at some time in the future our borders open to enable trade and international education resume.The case for changeI believe that the resilience of our waters infrastructure network is something that we can no longer ignore.We are faced with a three waters system that is under pressure across New Zealand, suffering from historic underinvestment, aging infrastructure, and all too common failure.Wherever we live, every New Zealander in their community should expect to turn on the tap and drink the water and not worry that they might get sick.We all want to be able to swim in our rivers, lakes, beaches and gather kaimoana without worrying about raw sewage seeping into those waters and making us sick.In many Māori communities there is an acute feeling of despair especially when they have a spiritual or ancestral connection to water and its life giving properties. This is the ‘mauri’ or life principle of water and provides some insight to the references of Te Mana o te Wai associated with freshwater outcomes.We are all now familiar with the looming financial hurdles:up to $575 million is needed to upgrade drinking water plants to meet standards; about $3-$4 billion for wastewater plants to meet environmental standards; and Several billion dollars to fix aging storm water pipes and networks. In addition to the financial hurdles matters are compounded by an ineffective regulatory framework:A framework which is not strong enough to ensure the safety and quality of our drinking water. A framework which does not provide assurances that wastewater and stormwater systems are delivering outcomes that are acceptable for communities, tangata whenua and the environment.The vision New Zealand deserves world-class drinking water, wastewater services and a resilient approach to storm and floodwaters.Services that not only ensure the safety of our people, but deliver:better freshwater outcomes;greater reliability of water network services for citizens;improved resilience to climate change and natural hazards; andIncreased transparency and accountability while operating on a more financially sustainable footing. As lead Minister of the Government’s Three Waters Reform Programme, I’ve been working with senior ministerial colleagues over the last three years to reform our approach to water and its associated services. It feels like the longest conversation with them and you.But I am committed to engaging with local government, water sector stakeholders, iwi/Māori representatives and national bodies, I’m pleased to say that good progress has already been made.Progress made – Taumata Arowai and regulatory reform A new national water services regulator – Taumata Arowai – has been established and should be operational by mid next year to oversee and enforce a strengthened drinking water regime. This regulator will also have a remit to oversee the environmental performance of wastewater and stormwater systems across the country. While regional councils will remain the primary regulators of stormwater and wastewater under the Resource Management Act, Taumata Arowai will be tasked with providing oversight of the regulation and management of these networks to ensure that good environmental outcomes are being achieved.In addition, one of Taumata Arowai’s objectives will be to give effect to Te Mana o Te Wai in undertaking its functions and duties. A Māori Advisory Group will provide advice and guidance in carrying out these roles and that perspective will be evident in the establishment Board.I’m advised that Taumata Arowai will turn its focus to council-operated stormwater and wastewater services once it has bedded in its administration of the new drinking water requirements. This will initially involve it pulling together a comparative view of the performance of council-operated stormwater and wastewater networks across the country. This will provide for the development of advice and guidance on:good practices in the design, operation and management of these services; and Risks and issues related to performance and practice of the services. These new stormwater and wastewater functions are designed to shine a light on the environmental impact of these systems, and the way they are regulated by regional councils.In developing its approach, I expect Taumata Arowai to work closely with regional and local councils, sector organisations and industry professionals. The Water Services Bill, recently introduced to Parliament, will provide Taumata Arowai with the powers it needs to administer these functions. I encourage you to take the opportunity to have your say on the Bill’s contents when it progresses through the Select Committee stage.Three waters infrastructure stimulus While strengthening the regulatory framework is an essential first step to improving the three waters system, we are mindful this is also an infrastructure problem.As you’ll be aware, many of the problematic stormwater networks and wastewater treatment plants are in small provincial towns.For example, the Timaru District Council’s stormwater network needs an estimated $15 million upgrade if it’s to meet environmental standards and prepare the district for potentially damaging floods.This could lead to a significant jump in this Council’s operating costs of between $500,000 and $700,000 a year, with costs ultimately borne by ratepayers. Faced with such expenditure, councils often have little choice but to defer upgrades, and increase their infrastructure deficit – a situation that may have been exacerbated by the financial hit that some territorial authorities will have suffered through COVID-19. This is one of the reasons this Government is allocating a	$761 million stimulus and reform fund to assist local government in upgrading critical three waters services nationally.Of this funding, $51 million will go towards the establishment of Taumata Arowai, while $30 million will help non-council rural water suppliers meet costs in the face of the new regulatory regime for drinking water. This investment package will kick-start much needed work to bring our drinking water, wastewater and stormwater infrastructure up to scratch, and support economic recovery and job creation.Service delivery reform We know, however, that there are broader challenges facing our water services that can’t be solved by funding assistance or regulatory reform alone. The current situation – whereby a large number of smaller water providers must fund and deliver water services and infrastructure across the country – is simply not fit for purpose. We need a committed effort to work these challenges out together.That’s why councils’ eligibility to access a portion of the Crown funding package is dependent on them engaging in a conversation about national water service delivery reform. It will be difficult, and it will take time – but I believe if we work together, we can put in place arrangements that realise significant health, environmental, economic and other benefits over the medium to long term.As a starting point, we’d like to see the creation of larger, more financially viable water service providers, able to take advantage of cross-boundary economies of scale and communities of interest.We have to find our way through the current political hurdles of asset ownership, cross subsidisation, efficient procurement, sustainable growth within a catchment and cost benefits to ratepayers without being drawn into council parochialism. Our intention is for publicly-owned multi-regional models, collectively owned by member councils.These entities would be able to deliver more affordable, efficient, reliable and resilient water services, while significantly improving the safety and quality of drinking water, and the performance of wastewater and stormwater systems.Led by a joint Central and Local Government Three Waters Steering Committee, officials have started a significant programme of engagement with local authorities and iwi/Māori representatives. This conversation will extend to the wider water industry and others as this three-year reform programme progresses. As stormwater professionals and industry representatives, your input will be crucial as we begin to consider the potential scope and role of these new entities. For example:What role might the new water entities have in the management and operation of stormwater networks? How could new national arrangements improve resource coordination and unlock strategic, cross-boundary opportunities for stormwater networks? What organisational arrangements might best support the stormwater sector, including opportunities for industry recruitment, professional development and training?As you network and reconnect over the next three days, I encourage you to consider these sorts of questions. Think broadly and boldly – what would you like to see in this once in a generation transformation of water service delivery arrangements?Urban water quality and Freshwater reformsThe three waters, of course, are closely interconnected as one holistic system – from the source to the tap and back to the receiving environment. That’s why I’m fortunate to also be closely involved, as Associate Minister for the Environment, in the Essential Freshwater work programme, particularly as it relates to urban water. Through this programme we have committed to:stopping further degradation of our freshwater resources and making immediate improvements so water quality improves within five years; andReversing past damage to freshwater resources, waterways and ecosystems so that they are restored to a healthy state within a generation. That’s why the Government has announced major changes to the freshwater management system. Earlier this month, we gazetted and passed into law the new National Policy Statement on Freshwater Management 2020, National Environmental Standards for Freshwater, stock exclusion regulations, and regulations in the measurement and reporting of water takes. These instruments use Te Mana o Te Wai as their guiding principle. This is a concept for all New Zealanders. It refers to the essential value of water, and the importance of firstly sustaining its integrity and health, before providing for essential human health needs and then for other consumption.We all have a responsibility to uphold Te Mana o Te Wai. Freshwater quality is not just a rural issue, and urban communities must also play their part. For urban areas, the new national direction strengthens our obligations to protect and restore our urban waterways, including by:preventing loss of urban streams and wetlands; and Ensuring urban development is managed in a way that considers the impact on freshwater and coastal environments.Urban Water Working Group We are also looking at other ways to support resilient and liveable urban environments that uphold Te Mana o Te Wai. These are reflected in the Urban Water Principles, which were developed by the Urban Water Working Group, which has made an important contribution through its leadership in this area. The Group recently published a set of policy and practice recommendations to promote the implementation of the Urban Water Principles, which can be found on the Ministry for the Environment’s website. I encourage all of you to consider how you can incorporate the Group’s vision into decision-making at every level, including policy, planning and infrastructure design. Central government is also considering how it can play a greater role in improving urban water (including stormwater) outcomes.As a first step, I understand that Ministry for the Environment officials are preparing guidance on how local authorities can improve stormwater outcomes through policy, planning and delivering infrastructure, and consenting stormwater discharges. This guidance is expected to be published later this year, as part of a wider package to support the implementation of the new National Policy Statement for Freshwater management. In addition, the Ministry is scoping the development of a proposed new national environmental standard for wastewater discharges and overflows. I understand that the Ministry will be taking a collaborative approach to developing this instrument, and officials will look to have discussions with the sector shortly.Concluding remarksIn closing, I know this reform programme has been like a slow and unfolding conversation over the last two and half years.But it’s too important to drop by the wayside and I’m not going to let that happen.Matters concerning water are complex and cut across the cultural, political and policy conundrum associated with reform of this nature.We need good considered water reform for Aotearoa New Zealand, future generations, and we need to take people with us. It’s a necessarily long reform conversation, but if we act in a way that we consider our contribution as kaitiaki of water and also the process of reform we will reach an outcome that will secure the long-term wellbeing and resilience for all to benefit."

It’s a momentous day – congratulations to you all.  You are graduating at a time when our nation is in various alert levels.It has meant that your family and close friends are not here in person, and instead are watching the graduation online.However, that does not diminish the pride being experienced by your family and friends as we speak.Your family and friends are your greatest advocates who understand the personal work you have undertaken to pass the course.And while not here in person, be assured your family and friends recognise that it is a serious achievement to graduate from police college and embark on a policing career.This is, of course, a time when the country needs our frontline emergency workers the most. The confirmation of COVID community transmission in Auckland is a serious matter.The Government’s priority remains to do everything in our power to contain this virus and stamp it out.For the health of every individual in New Zealand.And for the health of our economy. With the New Zealand Police force supporting our team of five million, we have overpowered this virus before. As new constables you will have a role to play in supporting the effort to combat the pandemic.You’ve joined to make a difference in people’s lives, and make a difference you will.Such commitment to frontline emergency work with the New Zealand Police must be commended.At this time, and every three years, you’ll hear a lot of talk about law and order. When you do, perhaps you should ask yourself this question – “but how do we get law and order without the resources, and the men and women in sufficient numbers in our police force, to make sure there can be law and order”.  We have been a strong supporter of our Police Force, especially for it to be resourced properly. It is why we negotiated in the 2017 Coalition Agreement the creation, in three years, of 1800 new frontline police.We exceeded expectations.As of today we have seen 2,309 new officers successfully graduate since the Government was formed on 24 October 2017.The police workforce is now the largest it has ever been with a total workforce of 14,000, and a current low attrition rate of approximately 2.3% per annum.We’ve seen other milestones important for our communities – we’ve seen the number of Māori Police officers exceed 1000 for the first time, female officers exceed 2000 for the first time and Pasifika officers exceed 500 for the first time.We’ve also delivered frontline officers to rural and provincial New Zealand, because we know that our provinces need to thrive if New Zealand is to do well.Police districts now have more resources to better keep people safe, to better respond to crime and victimisation, and to do more to reduce reoffending.But back to our new constables – Your graduation today marks the next stage in your life journey, as you step out of the Police College and into the community. Out there, you will be serving your community, working with and for the citizens of New Zealand in an uncertain time.You take into those communities your diversity – whether that’s diversity of thought, of background, of experiences, of ethnicity, or of language – and you will use that to further enrich this great Police service.You will enjoy many good times and the close camaraderie of your colleagues, but there will be difficult times too and hard lessons to learn. At times your job will be tough, real tough. You will deal with difficult people, challenging situations, and you will see people at their worst.But you will also be able to help people in countless ways, you will meet many good people and you will also see people at their very best.To the family members and friends who, we hope have been able to hear us today, your love and support will be very important as these new constables progress through their careers.To Wing 340, sincere congratulations, and best wishes to you in your police career.  On behalf of all New Zealanders in such troubling times – thank you!ENDS"
2020-07-23T00:42:22Z,                                                                                                                    Hon David Parker                    ,  Trade for All and the state of international trade,"Address to the Trade for All Advisory Board, July 23, 2020.Trade and Export Growth Minister David Parker Good morning.Today I would like to discuss the “state of the world” in international trade, the concerning trend towards protectionism and three major challenges I see ahead of us – the environment and trade, digital trade and the challenges assailing international institutions. I will then outline New Zealand’s response to all of this including our immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis, our trade recovery strategy, and finally Trade for All, about which I have some specific announcements.Before I discuss these matters, I would like to comment on our ongoing negotiation with the European Union. The European Union is our third largest market after Australia and China. It is also the source of our largest trade deficits. It has long been a close partner for us in many areas: support for liberal democratic values, addressing global environmental issues, shared values and human rights, the rules-based system, sound governance including data protection and the rule of law. Most importantly, we share a commitment to international trade rules that deliver a level playing field.I am therefore sympathetic to mounting concern within New Zealand about the EU’s approach to our negotiations. And in that context to the ongoing trade deficit with the EU – 2-1 in its favour – of about $5.5 billion in the year to March. That’s $5.5 billion in the context of a total current account deficit of $8.5 billion.The  EU’s high tariffs and other significant trade barriers are the cause of the prolonged trade deficit. The imbalances are obvious. Our frozen fish traders face  an 8-22% tariff into the EU; our onions 9.6%  and our kiwifruit 8.8% tariff. All of their main competitors from other countries get in paying nothing at all. In sharp contrast, key European exports such as wine, cheese, autos and pharmaceuticals benefit from some of the most open MFN trade settings in the world in the New Zealand market. This imbalance in treatment was reinforced by the EU’s recent poor quality and protectionist offer to us in the last round. I am also conscious that there is an erroneous perception that we are taking this lying down. The negotiation remains by far the best vehicle to redress these imbalances, but I can understand the frustration of those who say we should raise our tariffs against the EU, especially in these difficult times. In a global environment characterized by rising protectionism and the imposition of tariff and non-tariff trade barriers in many jurisdictions, and in light of our common values and approaches, this is not my preferred approach. But it is not tenable for the EU to continue to impose such costs on our country. In this regard I agree with the notion that persistent trade deficits should cause policymakers to look to the reasons behind the imbalances. And that when trade deficits are the result of the lack of reciprocity in market access or the use of subsidies the rules of trade should change.  The EU says they support fair trade, with environmental and labour standards important to them. They can get this from us in a way that few other countries can offer. I hope we can land a deal. We have many other countries we can buy manufactured goods that we currently buy from the EU. If we do not achieve acceptable reciprocity from the EU we have rights to pursue other solutions. I expect the European Commission is aware of this and look forward to the negotiations.Overall economic situationThe World Trade Organisation’s Trade Forecast predicts that world merchandise trade will reduce by between 13 and 32% in 2020. The OECD estimated in April that GDP drops 2% for each month of strict virus lock-downs. The latest Treasury figures for New Zealand are better than they would have been had we not stamped out community transmission. They predict a contraction in GDP of 4.6% in the year to June 2020, with a further 1% contraction by June 2021. New Zealand overall goods exports have remained largely steady throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, although there was a 2% dip in April. Two key exporting services sectors – international education and tourism - have however been very hard hit by our necessary border restrictions. Overseas arrivals in April were virtually zero against  307,000 in April last year. The news is not all bad for services, however, with digitally delivered services seeing an increase, and domestic tourism bouncing backOur economy is one of the most open in the world. By “going hard and going early” we have  avoided the worst of the COVID-19 economic impact, but many of our trading partners have not. The world is looking at the largest economic shock since the 1930s. This is not a financial crisis like the GFC. It is  a demand and supply-side shock. At a time when interest rates are already at an all-time low, meaning that conventional monetary policy is not working well, Government responses outside of monetary policy have to carry more of the load. In short, the global environment in which we trade has changed profoundly. Economic shocks of this magnitude tend also to be accompanied by significant changes to the wider global economic structure. It may be that many of the facets of the post-war economic system will shift over the coming years.Rising ProtectionismI am concerned by a broader emerging global trend towards protectionism. This was apparent before the advent of COVID-19, but the economic impacts of the pandemic certainly risk exacerbating it. At one point following the COVID-19 outbreak, nearly 80 WTO Members had more than 100 new restrictions or other barriers in place - mainly on PPE and medical products. While I do not agree with the protectionist approach being pursued by a number of economies, or some of the “hostage taking” behaviour we have witnessed by various major players or groups in recent times, it is undeniable that there are some fundamental challenges in the global trading system that need to be addressed. I want to touch on three of them today:1 Trade and the EnvironmentWhile the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest global challenges in generations, it comes on top of the climate crisis which is perhaps the greatest environmental challenge in the history of humanity. The inextricable links between climate change, the global economy and trade policy are becoming ever more apparent. We and all of our partners need to ensure a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery from COVID 19 aligns with climate change, trade and sustainable development agendas.  The crisis has shown that it is possible to make transformational changes almost overnight. So there is no good reason not to be phasing out fossil fuel subsidies and moving rapidly away from fossil fuel technologies. Globally, governments are subsidising fossil fuel production and consumption to the tune of over $500 billion US dollars a year. As Prime Minister Ardern has said, this is the height of policy incoherence.Trade rules are used in the WTO context to address industrial and agricultural subsidies. They have an important role to play here also. This is not new territory for New Zealand. As well as pushing for action multilaterally, we are currently negotiating a new Agreement on Climate Change and Trade Sustainability (ACCTS) with other small but ambitious countries Costa Rica, Fiji, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland. The ACCTS initiative will tackle fossil fuel support by establishing rules and prohibitions on this type of harmful spending. ACCTS will also eliminate market access barriers on environmental goods and services, encouraging the transition to low carbon renewables. This open plurilateral begins with a small group of countries, and will expand to create the momentum for multilateral solutions – always our overarching goal.The Trade for All Advisory Board’s recommendation to review our framework for environmental trade provisions provides a valuable opportunity to modernise our policy settings on this important trade and climate nexus.     The headwinds against reform have been strong, but it is possible to envisage a new model of economic globalisation that focuses on areas where international cooperation truly pays off – the global commons including climate, biodiversity, and health. I for one, am up for a discussion on border adjustments for high carbon goods. This week the European Union confirmed they will introduce carbon border adjustments in 2023. I know these are contentious and create trade risks, but our efforts to decarbonise and to clean up our own system of production could be undercut by high carbon imported substitutes. Multilateral rules have so far been ineffective. Perhaps as a country working with others we could be a pathfinder here too. 2 Digital TradeOn digital trade the COVID-19 epidemic has accelerated trends which are dramatically changing of our economy. The “lockdown” in many countries has provided a significant push towards people both working and shopping online. These changes will remain. That  throws in to stark relief challenges in international economic policy around, for example, the appropriate way to tax digital activity. As with all such complex international economic issues, the optimal way to solve these issues is collaboratively and multilaterally; or at least plurilaterally. This is why I have supported the negotiations at the OECD as a first best solution. This process is facing headwinds. Recent developments on taxation issues, leave me pessimistic about the prospects for a plurilateral outcome within the proposed timeframes and I am aware that many WTO members, including the European Union, are considering digital levies. I can understand that pressure and again, this is a matter we will need to consider here as well. More broadly, the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA) that I signed in June with Chile and Singapore is a good way forward.   3 Challenges to International InstitutionsIt is a challenging period for various multilateral institutions. A number of major economies, from whom we have expected leadership, have stopped supporting and investing in a range of institutions. The collapse of the WTO’s appellate body and lack of meaningful progress in its negotiating function are mirrored in the inability of many other institutions, both economic and otherwise, to resolve increasing frictions. Progress on any front is hard to find. APEC is another institution which has a role. It is challenges like these that make institutions like APEC important. The government has announced that our hosting of APEC in 2021 will take place virtually, so that we can get on and organise for next year at a time of unprecedented disruption. We want to use our host year to forge a collaborative regional response to the economic impact of COVID-19. We also want to make use of APEC to build confidence in the rules and norms of the multilateral rules based system. New Zealand ApproachIn the face of the challenges I have outlined above, and indeed the protectionism manifest in some of our key trading relationships, New Zealand may be required to chart new courses of action. We will not give up on the international institutions we have derived such benefit from over the years, and retreat to a more inward-looking trade policy. But we will need to build resilience and encourage greater reciprocity from our trading partners. As we have done in the past we have the opportunity to act as pathfinders in seeking solutions. . In our responses to the disruptions to the global economy wrought by COVID-19 we have resisted protectionism. We want to maximise opportunities for trade to contribute to a robust economic recovery for New Zealand and others. But we need to be realistic, and adjust to the global circumstances we find ourselves in. Reciprocity and addressing trade imbalances will not occur by wishing and hoping the world returns to the trading conditions of the past quarter century. NZ Immediate COVID-19 ResponseNew Zealand’s immediate goal was to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control within our borders and to mitigate  the impacts  on our people, health system and the economy. We have sought to protect New Zealand’s supply chains to ensure we could access essential items like medicines, PPE and COVID-19 testing kits, as well as continuing to export our products. As with the rest of the team of 5 million, everyone did their bit. We drew on strong relationships. When things were urgent, we picked up the phone. The New Zealand – Singapore Air Freight Project was an early initiative to help maintain our access to essential medical supplies, and access for our exports. Early contact with Singaporean Ministers and officials, led to the development of a joint statement committing to sustain trade and supply chain connectivity. There are now 12 ministerial signatories, with China having joined on 2 July. We operationalised this commitment by suspending tariffs on medical and PPE-related goods.We have since joined a variety of statements in different fora, all with the aim of building a groundswell of commitment to avoiding protectionist measures and maintaining supply chains. We are working  to resume cross-border travel, subject to the need to safeguard public health. Trade Recovery StrategyWe launched the Trade Recovery Strategy on Monday 8 June. It is aims at realigning our efforts to put us in the best possible position to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic.The Strategy consists of three elements: Supporting exporters, including through an additional $216 million over four years allocated to strengthen NZTE’s service offering and an enhanced cross-agency focus on assisting exporters;Reinvigorating the international trade architecture, including the WTO, our expanding FTA network and newer “open plurilateral” agreements; andRefreshing key trade relationships, with a view to expanding the market opportunities that our exporters can choose from, enabling them to be more resilient to future disruptions. Concerted Open PlurilateralismOne mechanism for progressing our trade liberalisation efforts will be what we are calling “open plurilateralism.” The idea is straightforward; too work with like-minded partners - typically small and medium-sized economies - to put in place ‘building blocks’, which others can then join as their recovery permits.The prototype of this was the P4 that led ultimately to CPTPP. Strategic Resilience/Re-ShoringThere is a further element to our trade recovery strategy. This is what I am calling building New Zealand’s strategic resilience. This is about us preparing for the long term challenges posed by weaknesses in international connectivity. Supply chains are being reviewed internationally. Some governments restricted exports of “essential goods” including materials needed to produce PPE. Businesses are reportedly looking to build in greater redundancy in their international processes or to source some critical components closer to home. There is a proper question as to whether we need to be looking at greater self-reliance in some products. I, for one, am pleased that an earlier Labour government – after SAARS – contracted a New Zealand supplier of high quality face masks. There is certainly an argument to be had here for some critical technologies and materials. This is WTO compliant. Any such measures should be targeted and minimise unnecessary costs on our economy.  Let’s not forget that despite the unprecedented challenges, supply chains have worked. Fisher and Paykel Healthcare continued to supply world markets with critical ventilator components. Inward goods were stretched but worked. I am optimistic fast global cooperation on vaccines will overcome protectionist tendencies, and that New Zealand will play its part in that journey. This is proper and we should remain very cautious indeed about the suggestions of some WTO members that say they want to “nationalize” supply chains. This can quickly become protectionism in another guise.   Trade DiversificationWe continue to seek new opportunities to broaden the market access available to our exporters. Where exporters send their products is ultimately a commercial decision for them, but if we provide more options by levelling the “playing fields”, they can diversify their options and help to build a more resilient export profile for New Zealand. CPTPP is helping us through Covid. The negotiation with the EU, and the launch on 17 June of FTA negotiations with the UK are important too.  Trade for All and the Social License However, there is little point in securing a strong trade recovery from COVID-19 if the benefits are not sufficiently felt across the country as a whole, including by Māori and in the regions. Our international trade needs to deliver for kiwis.  Kiwis should be able to trust the way we act in the world. And that is where the Trade for All agenda we launched nearly 2 years ago fits in. You, as the Trade for All Advisory Board, produced a strong set of recommendations that covered both the way we operate here and how we should act offshore. My Cabinet colleagues and I agree with you.   Cabinet has agreed to implement your recommendations as short, medium and longer term priorities.  I have further assessed your recommendations through the lens of our Trade Recovery Strategy and the majority of them reinforce it.  The small number that don’t – about 12 recommendations – stand on their own as contributions to our policy settings. In short, there is nothing in your recommendations that doesn’t align with our trade recovery objectives.     Some examples of responses to some of your specific recommendations are Strengthening the connection between NZTE and MFAT, and a funding boost, to better help New Zealand business, particularly SMEs; A huge uptick in proactive and public reporting from our embassy network in key markets about the conditions faced by New Zealand businesses; Developing a new trade and environment framework, which should be completed early next year;Intensifying our work with Te Taumata as a complement to ongoing consultation with Maori;The conclusion of the first agreement amongst the Inclusive Trade Action Group (ITAG) on trade and gender, with Chile and Canada; In the context of the UK-NZ FTA, establishing specific negotiating groups on the five focus areas of Trade for All; andThinking about our approach to National Interest Analyses, as recommended, in parallel to the UK, EU and RCEP negotiations. Not everything will happen immediately or exactly as you drafted. But work is already underway. I am pushing my officials to deliver on this.   I would like to enlist your help and retain the Trade for All Advisory Board, to help us to chart a course for New Zealand trade policy in a post-COVID era.   I would like to meet every six months to advance this. Times they are a-changin’ for trade. And New Zealand will be better off for your input. ENDS"

Thank you very much, David, for the introduction, and thanks to Zespri for hosting us. I want to acknowledge my colleague Hon Damien O’Connor, and I’d like to acknowledge all the work that Agritech New Zealand has done to bring us all together.Finally I want to acknowledge you all for giving up your time to join us today. I know that many of you have also contributed to the development of this work and I thank you for your ongoing commitment to the agritech sector.ITP aim and sector success examplesOur Government believes we can grow the agritech sector into a stronger economic contributor, increase agritech exports, and advance sustainable primary production in New Zealand.We want to grow a cluster of large agritech firms that can take on the world, and build on New Zealand’s agricultural strength.We can build on a platform of excellence.Companies such as Gallagher, a long-established firm with a proud history of invention going right back to the first electric fence. Start-ups such as Biolumic, and entrepreneurs like Steve Saunders with Robotics Plus.Simcro which is creating ways to better care for our animals and protect their health, and Tru-Test which is helping farmers collect data and information on their animals and their farms. To name just a few.Vision for the sectorWe’re here today to launch the Industry Transformation Plan for the Agritech sector. And like all good plans, it starts with a vision.Our collective vision for the future of the agritech sector is a globally competitive agritech ecosystem, which produces ingenious, value-adding companies that provide meaningful jobs, and helps solve New Zealand and the world’s sustainability problems.This vision emphasises one of the key opportunities identified in the Industry Transformation Plan or ITP. We have a tremendous amount of intelligence, talent and valuable ideas across our agritech businesses and researchers. Until now this talent has been largely directed inwards to solving New Zealand-specific problems, but we can do more.We have the ability to solve some of the big problems affecting the primary sector globally, and if we can focus our efforts on those, then there will be significant returns for our companies and for our country.To help us achieve this vision, the ITP sets out a detailed action plan that addresses the challenges faced by the sector in a holistic way, with specific focus on areas such as:getting better at commercialising our IPattracting more investment, re-orienting towards delivering solutions for global marketsand ensuring we have the skilled workers needed to develop and use agritech.To support the fantastic work that’s already been done and help us take those next steps towards our vision, the Government has committed $11.4 million to the implementation of the agritech ITP action plan. But money alone will not help us achieve our vision.Success will depend on how well Govt, private sector and the research community work together. Industry representatives will be a key part of the governance of this work, and Agritech New Zealand are working to develop advisory groups to give input into the delivery of each of the ITP action plan’s workstreams. Productivity Problems Over the last 30 years, New Zealand has experienced productivity growth that is low by international standards. GDP growth has been largely driven by more people working harder and longer rather than improved labour productivity. In recent decades governments have focused on ensuring strong system settings and efforts to lift aggregate productivity. As a result New Zealand is a great place to do business and we have been acknowledged globally for having generally strong policy foundations, but our productivity performance remains stubbornly low. Industry Strategy and ITPsRecognising that broad system settings alone are not enough to improve our productivity, we have developed a new Industry Strategy. The goal of the strategy is to address our productivity problem by actively focusing our efforts on specific sectors where we have a comparative advantage and can grow innovative industries that compete on a global stage, and in sectors where we can shift from volume to value.A core part of the Industry Strategy is the development and implementation of Industry Transformation Plans in partnership with industry. The process brings together all relevant parties to agree a long-term vision for the industry and identify the actions that can be taken by industry, government and others to realise this vision.Impacts of COVID-19Since we announced our Industry Strategy, the context has changed quite significantly. In addition to health and social impacts, COVID-19 has sent massive shockwaves through global economies and our own. The world is getting used to life with lockdowns, social distancing, and border controls And while now, thanks to the Team of 5 Million we have one of the freest economies in the world, our borders will remain closed for some time, and the global economy has taken a massive hit.Agritech and the primary sector have proven relatively resilient, but I must acknowledge the challenging times that you are all going through and the impacts on you and your businesses. How well New Zealand gets through this crisis, depends in large part on how agile our businesses are in responding to the new environment. Refreshed Industry StrategyCOVID-19 has forced us to rethink our industry strategy. COVID-19 has impacted different sectors of our economy in different ways, but reinforces our need to improve productivity and support recovery with the tailored approach outlined in our Industry Strategy. With this in mind, Cabinet agreed to a refreshed approach to Industry Strategy focussed on two core outcomes.The first is taking a collaborative and partnership based approach to drive change in our industries that face major transition challenges, whether it is tourism and export education post-Covid, decarbonisation in our energy sector, or overcoming entrenched productivity and workforce challenges in construction.The second, and the focus for us today, is supporting industries where New Zealand has a competitive advantage, to build clusters of highly productive  firms that can take on global markets.In this area we’ve prioritised three broad sectors: advanced manufacturing, digital technologies, and food and fibre. The food and fibre sector includes the agritech ITP we’re launching today, as well as work on the primary sector, food and beverage manufacturing, and forestry and wood processing.Agritech ITP – example of the ITP approach and principlesOur partnership with Agritech New Zealand and the broader sector in the development of this agritech ITP is a good example of this approach.Through the past 18 months, the agritech industry has carefully guided the direction of this work as it evolved into the plan we have today.Hundreds of people have participated at workshops and provided ideas and feedback. And I’d like to thank you all for your contributions.In particular I’d like to acknowledge Agritech New Zealand and the commitment of Peter and Jacqui Wren-Hilton, who have been an integral part of bringing the industry together around this work and getting us to where we are today. And thanks to all your efforts, this plan does a great job of telling the story of why New Zealand agritech is such an exciting sector, highlighting the breadth of the industry and the level of ingenuity amongst New Zealand firms and researchers. It sets out the context for New Zealand agritech and tells us where we are today. It details the history of the sector, its importance to New Zealand and its relative position in the world. It outlines the challenges that the sector faces and its advantages and opportunities. Conclusion and Next stepsIndustry policy, often caricatured as picking winners, has been out of fashion in New Zealand since the 1980s. In its place was the idea that the Government simply needed to set good policy foundations and then stand back to watch the market work its magic.In the decades that followed, the success of the world’s top performing smaller advanced economies – Israel, Singapore, Ireland, Denmark – in raising productivity, growing their competitive advantage, and building world-leading firms, tells us we need to rethink the orthodoxy.Those countries have been much more hands on, backing winners, and working hand in glove with the private sector to support competitive advantage. The results speak for themselves.Industry policy is back. The success of our work will depend on the quality of engagement, and whether Government can be smart, agile, and thoughtful; using all the levers available to create the conditions for your industry to realise its potential. We see today’s launch of the agritech ITP as a very good first step on what we hope will be a long and productive journey together with the agritech sector. Our task now is to implement this action plan and make our collective vision a reality.I hope that you will all continue to be a part of that journey.Thank you."
2020-07-20T04:04:00Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  Speech notes prepared for the China Business Summit,"Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished guests, I am delighted to be at my third China Business Summit, an event I have closely followed since its founding in 2012.Thanks you to Fran O’Sullivan for pulling this event together, and to all of you in the audience for looking so attentive at this hour on a Monday morning!China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner and one of our most important relationships. The China Business Summit is therefore an incredibly significant platform for New Zealand business leaders, policymakers and thought leaders to come together and share insights on evolving dynamics – particularly when it comes to trade.At a time when the world is facing the global COVID-19 pandemic, these discussions and relationships are more important than ever.This morning, I want to leave you with three points:First, that New Zealand-China relations are in good shapeSecond, that while we have different perspectives on some issues, we continue to manage these wellThird, and most importantly in the current global environment, , there continue to be many opportunities for New Zealand to work with China on.China-New Zealand bilateral relationshipOur Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, now in its sixth year, continues to be the basis of our relationship, alongside our longstanding history and the benefits that familiarity brings.The Partnership continues to deliver benefits for both of us, supported by a commitment to our ‘one China policy’, trade ties in excess of $32 billion last year, a New Zealand Chinese community of over 200,000, and historical cultural ties between Māori and Chinese. Exchanges in agriculture, climate change, education, and other areas are also key pillars. The relationship is one that has evolved and is a mature one, in which we work through issues constructively, professionally, and regularly. Last year’s impressive array of high-level political contact demonstrates this. I visited China in April, and six ministerial visits to China took place in the course of the year. Meanwhile, two Chinese Ministers, one provincial leader and several other senior figures visited New Zealand. Minister Peters also had the opportunity to touch base with his counterpart at the G20 in Japan, while I met Premier Li at the East Asia Summit in Thailand.But it is not just about the quantity of bilateral cooperation; quality is important. With this in mind, I want to briefly remind you of some of the achievements by our two countries that have occurred since I addressed this summit last year. Then I will look forward to what may come next ­– as much as we can predict the future in our current environment.TradeAs everyone in this room understands, trade is a bedrock of our relations, and has been resilient. While our goods exports to China have recorded some declines through the pandemic, certain sectors have done well. For example, New Zealand meat exports to China grew 24% in May and 16.8% in April, compared to the same time last year, and dairy exports were up almost 25% in the first five months of 2020. My congratulations to all of the exporters in the room this morning – you have been dealt a difficult set of circumstances, but have risen to the challenges presented. Your work has been supported by Government cooperation with China in a range of trade and economic fields.i. Business reformFor those of you who own or manage businesses in China, you will be pleased to know that New Zealand has worked alongside China to support it in improving its business environment, using the World Bank’s ‘Ease of Doing Business’ Index criteria as a way of driving progress. As the top-ranked economy in the Index, we believe New Zealand has a lot to offer in this area, and China is keen to cooperate.Last year, we held a bilateral workshop on ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in Beijing, with the New Zealand Companies and Intellectual Property Offices. Our Registrar of Companies and Registrar-General of Land were also invited to present to China’s top policymakers at China’s State Council-led ‘Ease of Doing Business’ conference in Beijing, in November, further helping to give impetus to China’s reform efforts. The results of China’s efforts have been remarkable, rising in the World Bank’s ‘Ease of Doing Business’ Index from 78th place in 2017, to 31st place in 2019. That is an incredible achievement.When I met Premier Li in November, I highlighted bilateral cooperation on ‘Ease of Doing Business’ as a positive area where both of us could continue to work together and share our experiences. Premier Li agreed, and has continued to champion China’s business reforms throughout Covid-19. I know New Zealand officials will be talking to their Chinese counterparts about how both sides might engage on ‘Ease of Doing Business’ virtually, in the coming months.ii. Free tradeWhen I met Premier Li at the East Asia Summit in November, I was also delighted we announced the conclusion of negotiations on the upgrade to our Free Trade Agreement, demonstrating our mutual confidence in the relationship, and our shared interests in open markets and the rules-based trading order. While Covid-19 impacted our signing plans, we hope to be able to sign the upgrade virtually to cement this important step in our relationship. As you know, the upgrade will bring benefit to both sides. For New Zealand, it will provide new access into services markets in China, tariff elimination on wood and paper products, improvements in customs procedures, and a new chapter on e-commerce committing to further developing e-commerce for trade. The upgrade will ensure that the rules underpinning our bilateral trade are responsive and fit-for-purpose.Amidst threats to the continued function of the WTO-based global trade system, and the rules-based multilateral order more generally, the upgrade is one of many signals China and New Zealand are sending to the world, in support of open markets. iii. Regional architectureAs significant exporters, upholding international trade institutions and rules is a priority for both China and New Zealand. That is why I was pleased that we recently came together with a number of other WTO Members to establish an interim solution for hearing appeals in trade disputes between governments and customs territories, until the WTO Appellate Body can become functional again.We also came together at the latest Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership negotiating round, and the WTO Mini-Ministerial in Shanghai in November. Amidst growing protectionism, the importance of these engagements cannot be overstated. Premier Li’s recent comment that a key objective for China continues to be to open itself up, suggests to me that our countries will continue to have opportunities to work together on bolstering regional trade institutions and rules in the coming months. I look forward to progressing that. People-to-people links But our relationship is not all about trade – it has a thriving cultural and people-to-people dimension, underpinned by our Chinese-New Zealand community. In May, I was pleased that funding was announced for a memorial to the SS Ventnor and those lost when it sank off the Hokianga coast in 1902. The 499 Chinese miners whose remains were being carried on the ship deserve recognition for their contribution to our country, as do many other Chinese New Zealanders over the course of our history. I was also pleased this past year with the work that Chinese and New Zealanders have done to successfully support greater cultural awareness and understanding on both sides. In November, the China-New Zealand Year of Tourism wrapped up. The year saw the magnificent Terracotta Warriors exhibition come to New Zealand, to a sell-out crowd. And here I’d especially like to acknowledge the efforts of Ambassador Wu Xi in making this such a success.  The Year of Tourism also had a significant Māori element to it, with a Tuku Iho exhibition sent to Shanghai, the Modern Māori Quartet performing in Guangzhou, and New Zealand Māori Tourism supporting Te Wehi Haka to perform in Chengdu and Xian (pron. she ahn). I am confident that people-to-people links like these will continue to be important for our relationship, even if only virtually for the time being, while Covid-19 remains a factor.Climate change and environmental protectionFinally, no discussion of China and New Zealand’s successes and shared interests is complete without acknowledging our likemindedness when it comes to climate change and environmental protection. Beyond co-chairing a nature-based solutions pillar at the United Nations last year, we also agreed to an environment chapter in the upgrade to our Free Trade Agreement – the most ambitious environment chapter and the highest level of commitment that China has agreed to in any Free Trade Agreement. We are looking ahead to our 3rd Ministerial Dialogue on Climate Change and technical discussions. We have laid a good foundation to continue to work together in this area. So, overall, a lot to be positive about in the relationship.IssuesAt the outset of my speech, I touched on differences, which I want to come back to now. Given countries’ particular histories, political and legal systems, and world views, it is natural for countries to take different perspectives on some issues. New Zealand is an open democracy, with a focus on the rule of law. We take a principles-based approach to our foreign policy, and we make our decisions independently, informed by our values and our own assessment of New Zealand interests.ChinaThe New Zealand government takes a stance where, as representatives of the New Zealand people, we think that the public has a direct and resounding interest in the outcome. As you know, this has come to the fore recently around developments like Hong Kong’s new security law, the situation of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang province, and Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Organisation. This is important to who we are as New Zealanders.Looking specifically at Hong Kong, which has been in the news in recent weeks, curtailing the city’s open governance and judicial independence without proper involvement of Hong Kong’s institutions, directly impacts on the thousands of New Zealanders living in, or with close ties to, Hong Kong.  Many New Zealanders have also invested in Hong Kong or do business there because of its independent judiciary and high degree of autonomy.  It is, then, quite natural for us to raise concerns about Hong Kong’s security law– we believe we are representing real and actual issues for New Zealanders. The way forwardIssues between New Zealand and other countries are normal, and should not curtail or define our bilateral relationships to which we remain absolutely committed. There is a Maori proverb, which says, ‘A problem is solved by continuing to find solutions’. This whakatauki refers to the need for creative thinking, adaptability and perseverance. The architecture of the China-New Zealand relationship, including on-going high-level political contact, officials’ dialogues, people exchanges, and arrangements between government agencies, has set us up well to continue to talk about our issues constructively, professionally, and regularly. The futureNow, as I signalled at the start of my speech, I would like to look to the future. Much of what I have said so far this morning is to explain and underline things that are already in place. While it is always important to have that context, I know that those of you in the room today are here because you are committed to our ongoing relationship and I want to assure you that I am too.New Zealand continues to be committed to working closely alongside China in areas where we share interests, and as the world grapples with COVID-19 this will also include considering new and emerging areas. Public healthFirst off, I expect China and New Zealand will continue to share perspectives on Covid-19. I am aware of officials from both sides having met a number of times, including earlier this month, to discuss our respective experiences on pandemic preparedness and public health strategies. The articulation by President Xi of a Covid-19 vaccine as a global public good is a strong vision worthy of widespread support.As members of the WHO, China and New Zealand will also support the WHO-led Covid-19 review, as mandated by the World Health Assembly earlier this year, to review the lessons learned from the international response to the present crisis, and to ensure we are better prepared for the next one. And I would like to acknowledge former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark who has been appointed co-chair.Free tradeSecond, as New Zealand gears up to host APEC – virtually given the situation the world is in due to COVID - I hope China will continue to support us on free trade, open markets, and stable supply chains. Inclusive and environmentally-friendly growth should also feature in our endeavours, as should sending positive signals to the world about free trade, including by signing our FTA Upgrade and RCEP.New Zealand businesses, like those here today, will continue to do business in China, and the New Zealand government, supporting MFAT, NZTE and other agency staff on-the-ground in China, stands ready to assist you. I know NZTE in particular will be assisting New Zealand exporters at the upcoming China International Import Expo in November. BordersFinally, we are keeping in touch with China on our borders and travel settings. I was pleased that Air New Zealand resumed passenger flights to Shanghai last month, albeit at a fraction of pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless, both of our respective borders are likely to continue to be restricted for some time, as the world searches for a vaccine. We will continue to explore our options to reopen travel for groups like students, but in the interim, I expect we will see innovative solutions established. For example, the University of Auckland’s two new learning centres in China are a creative and practical solution for its students unable to enter New Zealand, because of our border restrictions. ConclusionLet me wrap up by saying again that China is one of our most important relationships. Our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership is in good shape, and continues to work well, delivering benefits for both sides. Underpinning our relationship are successes, shared interests, and shared history, which all continue to bind our countries together. Our countries have have different perspectives on some issues, and I expect that we will continue to have these into the future. That is normal. Our relationship is a mature one in which we can manage differences constructively and professionally. Maintaining contact between both sides is key, and our relationship architecture has set us up well to do just this.As I have outlined, Covid-19 has presented ongoing areas of shared interest for us to cooperate on. The pandemic needn’t stop us from working together, achieving successes. In fact it can, and has, present new areas for co-operation. On success, to the exporters in the audience, a proverb as some inspiration this morning!Ehara taku toa i te toa takitahi, engari he toa takitini (Success is not the work of one, but the work of many)I encourage you all to make the most of today’s superb opportunity to build connections, share insights and support the on-going development of China-New Zealand relations. Your continued efforts to support our economic recovery are welcomed by the New Zealand government, and we will do whatever we can to assist your ambitions. Let’s keep talking as we move through the next few months. Xie xie."

Local communities and councils are well-placed to know exactly what they need so this funding can be used, for example, to meet the needs of affected families and individuals, community organisations or marae.“Other initial support has also been arranged. Skip bins will be delivered to Whangarei and Moerewa so that residents can dispose of water-damaged household goods. “Civil Defence Emergency Management will also arrange for septic tanks to be pumped in Moerewa once the ground has dried out.“This is a very challenging time for the community but I’m proud of how well they have responded and supported each other during this tough time. “We will stay in contact with local councils to see what further assistance may be needed as site assessments are completed in the coming days.“I am also advised that most local roads have reopened with some traffic management, but that SH1 Mangamuka Gorge is currently closed due to eight slips including a major slip located at the top of the gorge and four major under slips. An alternate route north via SH10 takes about an additional 10-15 mins travel time. Site assessments are taking place again today to better understand the size and scale of the damage. “I want to thank the local community leaders, Civil Defence, MSD, MPI and Rural Support Trusts who are on the ground providing support,” said Peeni Henare."

Kia Ora tatou katoa. Warm Pacific greetings.Can I at the outset convey my sincere condolences to the Niuean community of Aotearoa who mourn the passing of Sir Toke Talagi, Niue’s former Premier. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern paid tribute yesterday of Sir Toke’s significant contribution to Niue, New Zealand and the Pacific region. Greetings and acknowledgementsMy staff have asked that I should speak for no more than 5 minutes and to keep my remarks to just four points. First, I should promote the work of PEC. Then officially open PEC’s new premises. I should then make my announcement. And lastly I should launch PEC’s new online eLearning modules.However on special occasions such as today, the Samoan in me thinks I must acknowledge our community leaders who are present. That’s at least 10 minutes. Then with all Samoan speeches, I ought to provide a preliminary story that paves the way for my four points. Then of course, I need to consider an appropriate conclusion. That’s at least a 20-30 minute speech.All humour aside, this is such a special occasion for Pasifika Education Centre that we need to take our time and celebrate this special moment. It is appropriate that we acknowledge everyone involved in PEC’s history and story of the last 40 plus years.Thank you to Rev Suamalie for your blessing on this occasion. It is right that you do so. Everything I’ve read in books, and have heard from the mouths of our elders about our Pacific migration story tells me that the task of our spiritual leaders in helping us through the different legs of our journey is important. Our connection to the spiritual realm reminds us all of our place and role in the cycle of life.  This understanding keeps us grounded, and helps us to focus on our goals for the future.  Thank you Ron Viviani, PEC Board chair. I endorse your acknowledgements of the present and past board members. I echo your comments recognizing the former Board Chair Ms Mele Wendt for her work and commitment to PEC. I also endorse Tuiloma Gayle Lafaialii’s comments as PEC’s CEO in recognizing her team and past CEO’s and staff members. To all who were part of the 42 years of PEC’s history, thank you.Thank you also to the team at MPP for all your hard work and effort in this work.I acknowledge the presence of both the Samoan and Cook Islands Consul-General. Thank you for your presence today. Your presence and the presence of all our other elders today adds mana and dignity to our event. I don’t need to promote the work and vital role that the Pasifika Education Centre has to play in promoting our Pacific languages. Your presence today is evidence of the worth of PEC to you and our community. You are all guardians and custodians of our different Pacific languages. Thank you for your commitment and enduring dedication to this work.From the 2018 Pacific Aotearoa Vision SummitIn 2018, at the Pacific Aotearoa Vision Summit, I recall I used the following saying to set the scene for beginning a new journey.O le aso ma le filiga. O le aso ma le mata’igatila.This means, that there is a day appointed for preparing every needful thing for our long journey.  There is a day appointed, to check that our double-hull canoe is safe and all our ropes tying everything together are tight and strong.Today is such a day. This is a day appointed to us to check and re-check all our preparations, before we embark on this new leg of our journey towards the future. A future where our Pacific languages and cultures are a vital source of strength, grounding us and giving us confidence. It is also a future where speaking our languages provides us with an intimate sense to our identity and our story, giving us a clear sense of belonging.At that Vision Summit, I released the Lalanga Fou report that the Ministry for Pacific Peoples had recorded what we captured from our community engagements. It included the dreams and aspirations of our Pacific peoples about the future they saw for themselves in Aotearoa, and the things they identified as valuable going forward.I was so pleased when I saw that in addition to the goals of prosperity, having a healthy and resilient population, and the focus on helping Pacific youth achieve their fullest potential, I also saw that Pacific peoples, especially our young people, all valued our Pacific languages and cultures. They also wanted to see our Pacific languages thrive in the future.The goal for thriving Pacific languages and cultures was accepted by Government. And so when we focussed last year on delivering a Wellbeing Budget for all New Zealanders, this also meant the Government also recognised the role that languages and cultures play in the wellbeing and success of Pacific Peoples. $3.9 Million from the 2019 Wellbeing BudgetIn the 2019 Budget we allocated an unprecedented amount of funding towards a Pacific package that would lift the skills and opportunities for Pacific peoples. This included a $20 million investment over four years for work the Ministry for Pacific Peoples would embark on that includes the establishment of a Pacific Language Unit and working in partnership with the wider Pacific communities of Aotearoa to ensure Pacific languages can thrive through future generations.From that $20 Million I am pleased to announce today that the Ministry for Pacific Peoples has allocated $3.9 million over four years to the Pasifika Education Centre. This is a significant investment that will enable PEC to boost its content, delivery and reach of community-based Pacific languages, cultural education and training activities and programmes.Pasifika Education Centre plays a key roleWhen I first became the Minister for Pacific Peoples and given delegated authority to oversee the work of PEC, I saw that PEC’s forward trajectory was uncertain. I believed that PEC can provide practical hands-on community-based Pacific language courses to ensure Pacific people in New Zealand can learn and use their languages at home, at work and in our communities.I believed PEC has a vital role in ensuring Pacific languages will thrive in Aotearoa New Zealand. I believed that PEC has a role to ensure that the Pacific languages that are under threat and vulnerable to being lost forever, can thrive, be celebrated and passed onto future generations.This $3.9 Million investment will provide certainty and confidence to PEC to continue serving our Pacific-wide communities in Aotearoa.I am also happy to announce that this investment will allow PEC to launch its online platform and eLearning modules today. These eLearning Pacific language modules will allow greater access for Pacific Aotearoa.I envisioned when PEC completely rolls out its online platform and eLearning modules that the face-to-face courses that are held in Auckland by PEC tutors can be shared online via technology to Pacific groups in the Waikato regions in real-time. I can see Pacific families all the way from Northland to Invercargill, or gathered at community rooms in Gisborne, or Hawkes Bay, or joining together in church halls in Whanganui, to learn their Pacific languages. I can see our young people learning our Pacific stories and building confidence in their heritage and being bilingual.Pacific bilingualism a competitive edgeBilingualism is one of our strengths that we often don’t appreciate or recognise its true value. Singapore is a nation that invests significant sums of government money to keep it’s bilingual competitive edge in their community and in the market place.Pacific bilingualism is our competitive edge. In my travels around New Zealand and in the Pacific region, I come across so many highly qualified academics, government officials, and experts who tell me they value their Pacific languages and cultures and recognise that Pacific bilingualism gives them a competitive edge in their personal life, including in their educational pursuit, in their careers, and in the modern market place.We need to celebrate our Pacific bilingual edge and promote it.Open new premises & launch online platformOnce again thank you to everyone who have worked hard to support the work of PEC, and to all of you for keeping the fires burning in our hearts to continue fighting the fight to value Pacific languages and cultures.There is so much more work we can do together and I look forward to supporting it.In the meantime it gives me great pleasure to officially open these new facilities for Pasifika Education Centre. And I am delighted to also launch PEC’s new online platform and eLearning Pacific modules. Let’s own this digital space. Congratulations everyone.Soifua.  "

I will take a bit of time to do that, and then I’ll be happy to take questions at the end. Since we moved to level one, we have continued work to ensure we have an ongoing level of preparedness for resurgence in New Zealand. The framework I will be speaking to today has been through a Cabinet process, and is more important than ever. It is designed to give the public, and our business community as much certainty as we can around what to expect if new cases inside our borders are found. And that is something we all must prepare for. We have been 75 days without community transmission here in New Zealand, but COVID is now exploding outside our borders and every country we have sought to replicate or have drawn from in the fight against COVID has now experienced further community outbreaks.We only need to look to Victoria, New South Wales, Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea to see examples of other places that like us had the virus under control at a point in time only to see it emerge again. This does not mean anyone has failed- it means perfection in the response to a virus, and a pandemic, is just not possible. That is certainly the case as we see this pandemic continue to grow.   The World Health Organisation this week reported the global infection rate is nearing 13 million cases, with over 215,000 cases reported globally on Tuesday. To put that into perspective when we closed our borders on the 19th of March there were 240,000 cases in the world in total. It’s fifty times worse than that now. We see this growth in cases around the world reflected in the steady stream of New Zealanders returning from overseas, some of whom are bringing the virus back with them, which we continue to contain at our borders. In the main the pattern of returnees carrying the virus reflects the state of COVID in the world, with our cases coming from places like India, the US and the UK. New modelling by Rodney Jones indicates there will be over 100,000 new cases a day in the US by the end of the month, nearly 70,000 cases a day in India and nearly 10,000 cases a day across Europe by early August. We will continue to welcome home New Zealanders from these places as citizens, as they have a right to come home to their legal place of residence. But with that right comes risk, and the need to continue ongoing stringent measures to keep them, and everyone around them, safe. Victoria in particular is a cautionary tale for New Zealand that we must learn from. It appears their current outbreak is linked to a managed isolation facility similar to the ones we run here and that the entire outbreak was seeded by just two cases. That goes to show how quickly the virus can spread and it can move from being under control to out of control, and that even the best plans still carry risk in a pandemic. It’s important to remember that our border facilities have served us well so far. Our testing regime is picking up cases amongst new arrivals who are in quarantine and nearly 30,000 people have been through a facility without a case of COVID transferring to the community. But there is limited room for error.Just as many of our frontline health workers like nurses who were in contact with COVID patients got the virus from those patients during level 4 lockdown, our frontline border and airline staff and staff in our managed isolation facilities are in daily contact with returnees carrying the virus. Even our most experienced and trained support workers have picked up COVID.Experts tell us that even with the best precautions possible, the chances of the virus passing from a surface, or contact with someone who is a carrier are high. We must prepare now for that eventuality and have a plan at the ready in the event that it does. The first thing we need to do is continue to ensure our border and our managed isolation facilities stay as tight as they can be. We have ensured our frontline workers at the border are safe by wearing appropriate PPE, getting regularly tested and that our systems for managing returnees are robust and limit the risk of spread. As I say the system has done the job it was set up to do to date. The work done by Minister Woods and Air Commodore Webb in recent weeks have made significant additional improvements in this space, and we will continue to improve the system. Australia is currently conducting an audit of its quarantine system and I’ve asked Prime Minister Morrison to share any insights so we can continually learn and improve on what we do here. But again, no system is 100% fool proof and around the world we are seeing even the most rigorous measures being tested by the virus. And so today I am setting out the next stage in our COVID plan in the event we have new cases in the community. The first thing to note is that the Government’s strategy for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic remains elimination. That has not and will not change. Allowing our hospitals to be overrun, further deaths and the economy to close down again for an indefinite period of time is not a strategy.We have seen overseas the toll that that takes on lives and economies.We have said from the start that the best approach for the economy is a strong health response, and the evidence has supported that approach throughout.We can already see that with New Zealand’s economy more open than nearly anywhere in the world because of the steps we took to break the chain of transmission under lockdown. Our plan moving forward seeks to protect that position and minimise any economic impact of future cases. So in the event of new community cases we would move immediately to implement our “Stamp it Out” approach again.  There are two key things to remember.Firstly, the simple approach of limiting the ability for the virus to move from human to human to break the chain of transmission remains the foundation of our response no matter what. That’s why our key public health measures remain important for protecting ourselves and each other from the spread of disease. They are: -  wash your hands regularly and thoroughly - cough or sneeze into your elbow - don’t go to work, socialise, or be out in public if you are sick - Keep a digital diary of your whereabouts by downloading and using the COVID Tracer app. These principles are key to the second ongoing tool in our response. Rapid contact tracing, testing, and use of isolation and quarantine for those exposed to COVID. That is why the Covid tracer app, and whatever other means of recording where you have been remains vital. Every time you step into the world I want you to ask this question “if I come into contact with COVID today, how will I know, and how will others know”. If you are in or near a situation of community transmission this will be an exceptionally important tool for contact tracing, and for finding you. In this area we are constantly looking at how we can use new technology to strengthen our response, the same goes for testing. But these are the principles we are all familiar with. Now I want to touch on what would be different.The alert level system and framework remains in place. But in the event of cases, rather than apply the framework nationally, we would look to apply our Alert Level system at a localised or regional level in the first instance.  Our priority will be to control any cases with the least intrusive measures, and over the smallest area we can.  In practical terms that means doing absolutely everything possible to avoid the entire country returning to Alert Levels 3 or 4 as a measure of last resort.  “Our ‘Stamp it Out’ approach is scenario specific meaning that our actions will depend on the severity of the situation. And of course when we see the first COVID-19 case beyond the border, you can expect us to move very quickly and very firmly to contain it while we gather information on the situation we are facing. However there are three broad starting scenarios we can plan around. 1. A case or a number of cases in a community. 2. A larger number of cases or cluster in a region3. Multiple clusters that have spread nationallyLet me run through what each scenario might look like. First a contained case or cases within a community.We would be looking at applying strong restrictions but only applied locally in a neighbourhood, town or city to contain the virus and stopping it spread. We would likely remain at Alert Level 1 nationally. The local measures to contain the case would involve rapid contact tracing and isolation of cases and their contacts, scaled up and targeted testing of people connected to the case, such as workmates, those they live with or those in their neighbourhood. The point with this scenario is we would look at act hard and fast, but local in an attempt to ring fence the virus.  The second scenario is a large cluster within a region. Here, a significant increase in testing would be the priority. We would look to undertake much wider community testing, on top of testing any contacts or potential contact of those with the virus. This could look like it did in Victoria where health staff went door to door to test people in affected areas. We would also take steps to stop the spread to other parts of the country so a regional shift in Alert Level would likely be applied that restricted travel. This would mean travel in or out of the city, town or region could be stopped, people in that place asked to work from home, and local restrictions on gatherings implemented. The aim here is to contain the spread away from other areas to avoid the whole country having to put in place restrictions so we can remain at Alert Level 1 nationally, depending on the evidence of risk of spread outside the region. The final scenario is if multiple clusters, spread nationally. In this scenario we would most likely apply a nationwide increase in Alert Level to stop transmission. There is an assumption in all of these scenarios that we know whether we have a contained outbreak or not. Where we don’t have full information, we will take a precautionary approach, and scale back as needed, rather than run the risk of doing too little too late. Ultimately though, as with the original application of the Alert Levels we will be guided by science and what we know works. Internationally the evidence remains that going hard and early is the best way to stop the virus and ultimately delivers the best results for human health and the economy over half measures that aren’t as effective at getting on top of the virus and sees us in lockdown for longer. We have learnt much from the first wave at stopping the chain of transmission and eliminating community transmission. We learnt if we act fast we can stop the virus spreading. We learnt that if we restrict contact we can stop the virus spreading and we learnt that everyone being vigilant and following the rules worked. No one wants to go backwards but the reality is our fight against the virus is not over and we must have a plan at the ready to protect our current position if it comes back. And I believe we can do that. Because the facts show when New Zealand’s team of 5 million goes about implementing a plan it works, no matter what comes our way. I’ll now take questions. "
2020-07-08T01:03:18Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Phil Twyford                    ,  Coastal Shipping Webinar ,"Introduction, seafarers and POALGood morning everyone, I am delighted to be online with you all today.Before I begin, I have to acknowledge that COVID-19 has disrupted the maritime sector on an unprecedented scale. The work of seafarers and the maritime industry is keeping many economies around the world afloat and is key in maintaining international connections.Managing the pandemic and keeping people safe is very challenging for seafarers and governments around the world, and I want to thank everyone for doing your bit.Firstly, I want to acknowledge Jo Murray from the Council of Cargo Owners and Annabel Young and her members from the NZ Shipping Federation for assisting the Ministry of Transport and EY in the development of the coastal shipping report.I would also like to acknowledge Brodie Stevens from Swire Shipping and Clive Glover from Strait Shipping for their support.Let’s start with the elephant in the room. Many of you will be watching the situation around a potential relocation of the Ports of Auckland.Cabinet has agreed the Ports of Auckland is not viable as the Upper North Island’s key import port for the long-term.The multi-billion dollar question is not if, but where and when it will move.As you probably know, a report on the options for relocating the Ports of Auckland freight functions, done by independent consultants Sapere, is now complete and has been released. It has some interesting things to say about relocation options – Neither the Port of Tauranga nor Northport are likely to be able to create sufficient long-term capacity to provide for both their own freight growth as well as Auckland’s. Sapere reached this conclusion using the same expert port engineers as used by the previous reports, but using a 60-year rather than a 30-year planning horizon, looking out as far as 2080 rather than 2050. Their highest ranked option is Manukau Harbour, which is considered technically feasible although difficult to consent. Sapere found that navigability of the harbour entrance and insurability of shipping to use the harbour are less of a concern than the previous reports identified, but this needs to be confirmed by a detailed feasibility study.This helpfully points to a way forward, that if we are fortunate enough to be re-elected, Labour will pursue.This includes extensive iwi and stakeholder engagement, and narrowing the set of options for a rigorous, evidence based comparative assessment. It remains Labour’s view that the future of the upper north island ports is a critical decision for the country’s freight supply chain. It must be made on the basis of what is right for NZ inc taking into account economic efficacy and environmental sustainability. The COVID-19 recovery work remains a priority across agencies, so it would will be some months after the election before advice is provided to Ministers on the next steps. Responding to COVID-19 During the COVID-19 lockdown, New Zealand’s transport system demonstrated it could bounce back after considerable disruption.                                                       I would like to acknowledge the work of the industry including the port workers, harbourmasters, stevedores, agents, pilots, seafarers to keep critical freight flowing at that time. I understand considerable pressure remains and we appreciate your commitment to working in a safe and healthy environment, to manage our border security, and minimise the risk of COVID-19.                                                        Vision for transportIt really highlights how important ports are to New Zealand. As an island nation, we rely heavily on our international maritime links to support our growing economy.By volume, 99 per cent of our exports and imports are sea freighted, linking us to markets far from our shores. The future of New Zealand’s ports, freight services and coastal shipping is critical to our economy.Our shipping sector fulfils a critical role in New Zealand’s freight system. As you will know, it is the most cost-effective and efficient mode for transporting large, heavy cargo, like petroleum products, cement and aggregate.This Government is committed to making the best use of all transport modes, whether that is rail, road, or coastal shipping.Benefits of coastal shippingAs I have been saying for some time, the Government is committed to moving more freight on the ""blue highway"".Rail and coastal shipping have been neglected historically, yet they still play an important role in the national inter-modal logistics market. They account for around 25 percent of freight tonne-kilometres at a national level.While coastal shipping is currently suited to move goods that are not time sensitive, it has been an underutilised and the Government believes it has a greater role to play within our transport system.The latest data shows that coastal shipping’s tonne-km has grown 12 percent in the last five years, and international trade through our ports has grown around 30 percent. (Figures show that coastal shipping transported 307,000 containers in 2012. This increased to 566,000 in 2019.)Modelling benefits from coastal shippingSo while there has been growth, the externality benefits that coastal shipping makes to NZ has not been well understood.Last year I asked the Ministry of Transport to take a look at this, and they contracted EY to investigate the externality benefits of coastal shipping. This built on the landmark EY report in 2016 on the value of rail, which showed that the total value of rail in New Zealand was estimated to be up to $1.54 billion each year, from just four areas – reduced congestion in our cities; reduced carbon emissions; improved road safety including reducing injuries and fatalities, and lower road maintenance costs for taxpayers.EY’s new report on coastal shipping will be available after this meeting.                                                         The report focused on three primary transport externalities, calculating the safety, emissions and congestion benefits of moving freight via coastal shipping compared with the road alternative. This included analysis of domestic movements and international transhipments.This externality modelling is not a full benefits model. Coastal shipping provides a wide range of value to the New Zealand economy – much of which is not captured through this analysis. The report does not go into for instance:                                         The direct contribution towards employment and GDP.  Opportunity cost avoided from having to invest in the roads.And how having the presence of multiple transport modes allows freight to continue to be moved through times of disruption, as was experienced through the Kaikoura earthquake.The overall findings from the report found that net external benefits from coastal shipping is valued at $306.4 million annually for New Zealand and up to $367.7 million under a 20 percent growth scenario.Much of this value is in the form of reduced travel times and congestion benefits for all road users.Congestion benefits account for 74% of externality benefits in the base scenario. Going forward this will help inform what policy changes are needed to support coastal shipping’s role in moving freight around New Zealand. Future of FreightFreight volumes are expected to continue to grow, and all parts of the freight system will be impacted by this growth. Consumer demand for next day and same-day delivery is increasing rapidly. Competition in the freight market continues to drive an increasing emphasis on speed, even when the nature of the freight may not require it. We cannot ignore that this could create barriers to the coastal shipping industry. But while it does not offer the ‘direct to door’ benefits that road freight does, coastal shipping is much more efficient and cost effective for carrying non-time sensitive heavy bulk freight.You have to acknowledge the safety, emissions and congestion benefits of coastal shipping and rail. GPS 2021This is explains why are exploring through the Government Policy Statement on land transport 2021 how we can increase the amount of freight moved by rail and by coastal shipping.As many of you know, work is underway to release a finalised version of the draft GPS 2021. Part of this work includes investigating the case for National Land Transport Fund support for coastal shipping and the land-based supporting infrastructure.In the draft GPS I outlined that ultimately, the Government’s expectation for investment in coastal shipping is to give freight transporters real choice, allow New Zealand flagged coastal shipping to operate on a level playing field with other freight operators, and to enhance the sustainability and competitiveness of the domestic sector. It also reflects the Government’s interest in partnering with industry to understand the challenges facing coastal shipping, and working with it to address these challenges. The initial three years of funding – up to $45 million - will include funding relevant research to see what future support for the sector will help achieve the Government’s aims. One of our proposed priorities is focused on tackling climate change. The numbers around the environmental impact of road freight versus other options are very clear. The freight sector, which includes more coastal shipping, has a role to play in a cleaner future. Transport accounts for 20 percent of carbon emissions, bringing those emissions down is one of our top priorities. We’re going to electrify the light vehicle fleet, phasing out diesel buses, getting more people walking, cycling, and talking public transport, transiting road haulage from diesel to electric and hydrogen, moving more freight by rail – and moving more freight by coastal shipping.The report indicates that around 362,000 tonnes of CO2 are avoided annually thanks to coastal shipping compared to if you moved that same freight by road. So coastal shipping has a big role to play in our vision of a zero carbon future. https://www.transport.govt.nz/news/sea/externality-benefits-of-coastal-shipping/"

I consider it an honour and a privilege to be with you all here today.This will sound perhaps a little bit dramatic, but no one could have predicted a few months ago that we would be here, all together, in what we used to call a Labour Congress but we now all know as a ‘mass gathering.’And I know we have all been around the Labour Party long enough to know that not all of our gatherings would deserve that metric. But here we are. And I am very grateful for that. And I am very grateful for all of you.What has been happening over the last few months in New Zealand, it’s not over.But I don’t want to wait till it is before I say thank you.You, our Labour members, you were amongst our team of 5 million.But more than that, you were worried for the rest of the team. Like many kiwis, you wanted to know that everyone had what they needed during lock down, that they were well looked after. So hundreds of you joined our teams of volunteers, and you called people for no other reason than to ask if they were ok. Over 81,000 calls. It’s that kind of thing that makes me proud to be a New Zealander, and proud to be Labour. I’m also very proud to be part of our parliamentary team.Each and every one of them work so hard, and while I am loathe to single any one person out, I feel safe in doing so for Kelvin Davis.I saw who Kelvin is captured perfectly recently by one of our amazing new candidates, Ibrahim Omer who wrote recently on Facebook “Hon Kelvin Davis was kind enough to invite me to his office today. As well as warmly hosting me and giving me good advice, he told me that when he first became a Labour candidate he didn’t have a suit and had to borrow one from his mate. He then reached into his wardrobe, pulled out this collection of his suits and handed them to me. What a bro.”And that is the Kelvin I know, a person who helps makes our team, a team.I’ve thought a lot about this idea of a team lately. Mainly because our team, and by that I mean our entire team of 5 million, have been through a lot in the last fifteen months. I can’t think of a time in our recent history when we have been collectively challenged by such a cruel combination of events – a terrorist attack, a volcanic eruption, a global pandemic and now its ensuing financial crisis.Our national character has been repeatedly put to the test and yet, somehow we have come back with an almost stronger sense of ourselves, and of what matters most to us. Gamal Fouda, the Imam of Al Noor mosque, perhaps said it best when in the wake of March 15 he said, we are broken-hearted but we are not broken. We are unbreakable. We are alive. We are together. And a year on, in the midst of such uncertain and tough times, together we remain. Being a team, and being unified, does not mean though that we are uniform. We are still a country of diverse belief systems, a place with strongly held opinions and views on issues and politics - in fact we frequently try to model that even around the Cabinet table. But that is what makes us, us. That’s what has always given us the confidence to do things our way.When a terrorist tried to divide us we came together and we said they are us. When a volcano erupted we threw our arms around those effected whether they were from near or far.And when Covid arrived we didn’t hesitate to act, knowing it was the only way to protect those around us. We stayed home. We stayed home, sometimes juggling care and work and kids and schooling. We stayed home despite not knowing if there would be a job to return to at the end of it or a business to re-open. We stayed home even when it meant we were separated from loved ones, sometimes in amongst grief and hardship. We stayed home, and that made all the difference. As I stand before you today we are 65 days since we last had a case of community transmission in New Zealand. That has meant we have been able to open up our economy sooner and more fully than most other places. It has given us opportunities that many others do not have. I know that none of us take that for granted.There is no playbook for what the world is going through, no rules on what we should or shouldn’t be doing. That means we won’t always get it right, but it also means we can make our own choices, and have our own plan. And that is exactly what we have done. Through our health response, our plan was simple. Go hard, go early. That gave us the best position to save lives and livelihoods by opening up our economy sooner. Had we chosen another path, if we’d chosen to have an ongoing tolerance of Covid and cases all around us in the community, I have no doubt we would still have restrictions in place that would be costing us in many, many ways.The health response has not ended. It will need to be ongoing as the pandemic surges around us.And it is surging. When we closed our borders on the 19th of March there were 240,000 cases in the world. Today there are more than 10 million.So while we in New Zealand experience huge freedoms the rest of the world is still battling to keep the virus under control.Our strong health response now gives us an economic head start, the ability to move from responding to Covid-19, to recovering and rebuilding.Today I am announcing our 5 point plan for our economic recovery. It’s about investing in our people, it’s about jobs, preparing for our future, supporting our small businesses, entrepreneurs and job creators and positioning ourselves globally.I’ve seen economic downturns before and what they can do to those left behind.And yes we must be mindful of the debt that future generations may carry because of what we need to do now.  But we would be wrong to characterise debt as solely being financial.If we choose not to invest now, during the rainy day we have been preparing for, we burden the future with debt of another kind.Some call it economic scarring – the long lasting damage to individuals of an economic down turn. I call it the loss of potential, and the greatest of wastes. I am a child of the 80s and 90s. I have seen responses to troubled times that have failed to take this into account, and have left people behind. We see the impacts of that still. Poverty, inequality, persistent unemployment.  It does not have to be this way, and under Labour, it won’t. We are the Party that puts people first. It is in our DNA. The First Labour Government delivered New Zealand from the Great Depression and created the platform for the longest period of economic prosperity we’d ever seen off the back of investments in health and education, social security and public housing, employment and decent wages. Michael Joseph Savage called it applied Christianity, I call it kindness. But no matter what we call it the principle is the same. If we put people at the heart of what we do, and at the heart of our recovery, we will prevail, and we will prosper. Which brings me to point one of our plan – investing in our people.With economies around the world shutting down, health systems being overrun by the virus, and borders closing the IMF is describing this as an economic crisis like no other and is projecting the global economy to decline by 4.9 percent in 2020. US unemployment was estimated to have reached as high as 16%.New Zealand is not immune to what is happening in the rest of the world, but we can buffer our people from it. And we can do that, because we were prepared. New Zealand is a place where the unexpected can happen. That’s why, when we were criticised for being focused on getting debt down to under 20% of GDP, we steadfastly argued that it was necessary – it was for a rainy day.Thank you for your foresight Grant Robertson. You have been the Finance Minister New Zealand needed at this time, because that rainy day has arrived.  Now is the time to put the umbrella up, to provide support to those who need it. You were smart and tough enough to put us in the position to do that, but kind enough to know when it needed to be called on.We have doubled the winter energy payment, increased main benefit rates by $25 a week, made changes to the In Work Tax Credit so we can reach more families, and introduced the Covid income relief payment. We have supported Whānau Ora agencies who played an absolutely critical role in supporting whanau on the ground and will continue to do so.We have brought back PACE, a scheme that supports our artists and our creatives in a time that has been devastating to their sector and made sure in the meantime that they were eligible for the wage subsidy.But truly investing in our people, means much more than just an income. Long before Covid, as we faced the challenges of digital transformation, the changing the nature of work, the need to move to a low carbon economy, and issues of low productivity.  There was already a pressing need to prepare our people for a very different future through training and retraining.  Now we have the opportunity to make sure our Covid response does just that, and to do what I have heard Joseph Stiglitz calls “double duty” - solutions that solve multiple problems, and get us ready for what the future holds. That’s why we made a $1.6 billion investment in trades and apprenticeships training, which includes making all apprenticeships free.  We’ve also made those areas of vocational training where we need people the most like building and construction and mental health support workers – all free. The potential impact of these policies is huge.I was talking to someone from one of our industry training organisations recently who reminded me that this is not just a policy for those exiting school.He had received a call recently from a mum, whose son had seen an ad for the trades. He was already in the work force, but was deeply unhappy. He decided to retrain, and in her words, it had saved his life. But retraining isn’t enough if there aren’t jobs to go into at the end of it.And this is where the second part of our plan kicks in, what I like to simply call, jobs, jobs, jobs. Again this is where we are marshalling our resources to ensure there are not only jobs available but that they are in areas that address long term challenges – the under investment in infrastructure, housing and protecting our environment.Now stay with me as our run through this, because these initiatives are substantial. First is the Big New Zealand Upgrade Programme designed to tackle our core infrastructure deficit.  We announced it at the beginning of the year, and it amounts to $12 billion of road, rail, public transport, school and health capital funding. It could not have come at a better time.It’s expected to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs in every community in New Zealand – already more than 1200 schools have had projects totalling over $200 million approved or completed; delivering new teaching spaces, laboratory upgrades and much needed renovations, opening up job opportunities the length and breadth of the country.Next up is our investment in housing. During Covid-19 something many of us thought wouldn’t be possible in such a short space of time happened – we housed our chronically homeless. Now we need to keep it that way.As part of our Covid response we have committed funding to providing an additional 8000 public houses, bring the total number of state and transitional houses to be built by this Government to over 18,000 by 2024 – thank you Megan Woods and Kainga Ora. It is the largest house building programme of any Government in decades, and I’m proud of it.But when we’re talking about infrastructure, it’s not just about the projects we in the government are responsible for, we also have the opportunity to partner with communities, with iwi and local government.That’s what the $2.6 billion worth of shovel ready projects we announced earlier this week were all about.Things like Home Ground, a project by the Auckland City Mission that will provide 80 apartments with wrap around support and care, or the Poverty Bay Rugby Park Grandstand, least Kiri Allen stage a sit in, right through to the Invercargill inner city development. Collectively these projects are estimated to create over 20,000 jobs in the next 5 years.But there is one more area where double duty can be truly brought to life. And that is our environment. We campaigned on cleaning up our waterways.David Parker, alongside ministers like Damien O’Connor, has worked tirelessly on delivering on that promise, and we have.The essential freshwater programme aims to make our rivers swimmable again. But we know there is much we can do to support this work. And now is the time. In the Budget we allocated $1.1 billion for nature-based jobs. DOC already has a number of conservation projects already underway, such as clearing wilding pine, but we are now stepping up the pace.Today I am announcing a package of 23 projects across the country that will clean up our waterways and deliver over 2,000 jobs.These projects will help restore our wetlands, rivers and streams, regenerate native bush and control pests while creating much needed meaningful work in the regions.Whether it’s Environment Southlands plans to actively manage 1000 of their top biodiversity sites across 300,000 hectares with pest control, wetland creation and fencing.Or Tairawhiti Environment Centre who plan to create hapu employment opportunities through hill country restoration and erosion mitigation.Or Bay of Plenty regional council who will create 170 jobs through a conservation cadets programme.These are projects that are ready to go and have the support of local councils and iwi.They’re projects that are not just part of our recovery, they are part of our rebuild.They will help restore our environmental reputation to what we know it should be, a reputation that underpins so much of our tourism, our trade, our brand. These initiatives aren’t just double duty, they’re triple, and they’re helping pay down the environmental debt that would otherwise be paid by the next generation. That brings me to the third plank of our plan – preparing for the future. Restoring our environment is one thing, decarbonising it is another.  Investments in waste management and improving energy generation will be key- and this is where I am signally there is more to come. Preparing for the future also means supporting our businesses to innovate, especially as we go through a period of digital transformation.There will be few among us who haven’t changed our routines and habits as a result of Covid-19. By the end of lockdown I can confirm that Damien O’Connor did indeed discover the unmute button on zoom.We want to support our small businesses through this digital transition, which is why we established a $10 million fund to incentivise e-commerce and train more digital advisors.It’s also why we will keep encouraging innovation in all forms. So we’ve created a $150 million fund to provide loans to R&D-intensive businesses. All of this builds to the fourth part of our plan, supporting our small businesses, our entrepreneurs and our job creators, work that is being ably led by Stuart Nash, and on this occasion I don’t mind you recording what I say next.One of the first thing we did when the virus arrived in New Zealand was to introduce the Wage Subsidy programme. Over 1.6 million New Zealanders have benefitted from the scheme – keeping them in work, and providing them with an income during the most difficult months of lockdown.It has meant our unemployment rate hasn’t spiked as it has in other countries where there has been little or no support to keep businesses and their staff afloat.I know this part of our plan has made a huge difference to business owners, because they have told me that. In fact, over the course of our Covid response, during lock down and beyond, Grant Robertson and I would frequently discuss some of the mail we were getting from employers. I remember at the end of a particularly hard day, Grant sent me a message.It was headed “Kia ora from a small business in Blenheim”It read “12 weeks ago today we received the wage subsidy to help maintain us during the tough times. I have to admit I had a lump in my throat when I explained the prospects to our staff at the end of March. Many scenarios played out in my head, but I promised that we would all hold tight for the 12 weeks of the subsidy and do our best.You all know how the last 12 weeks has played out so I thought it prudent to offer my sincere thanks. We are now back on our feet and even taken on a staff member laid off from another related business.The email was signed off with a simple, “No grizzles here. Nga mihi maioha.”  But I want to say thank you back. To all those businesses who passed on that wage subsidy and provided that shelter to others, who worked so hard and gave so much to help over 1.6 million New Zealanders people put food on the table - nga mihi maioha to you.  And now, our support for you must continue. Alongside the wage subsidy sits the Small Business Loan Scheme. This scheme provided access to zero interest loans, administered by IRD and underwritten by the Government.It filled a much needed gap not being filled by the banks and helped business meet their cashflow needs.Not too long ago I met a business owner in the Hawkes Bay – they shared their story, and that the loan scheme had provided them with a buffer as they faced the uncertainty of rebuilding their business in such unchartered territory. A building services business told us the loan gave them breathing space after lockdown. They had a lot of outgoings but nothing coming in so the loan bridged the gap as work came back on stream.  These businesses are not alone in facing cashflow issues - we’ve received more than 90,000 applications from small businesses so far, and paid out over $1.5 billion in loans. Around 80 per cent of firms who applied have between one and five staff. Currently this much needed lifeline is due to close for applications on 24 July. Today I am announcing that will be extending the scheme through to the end of the year. This means those businesses who are doing ok now, but who may experience cash flow difficulties further down the track will still have access to it.And the final plank of our five point plan is to continue to position New Zealand globally as a place to trade with, to invest in, and eventually to visit again.This has been an export led lockdown, and so too will it be an export led recovery. Since February 1, our merchandise exports to the rest of the world have kept pace with last year’s, which is incredible during one of the biggest global recessions the world economy has seen. Exports of Gold Kiwifruit in March were double the same month last year. The rest of the world wants not only our protein, but our furry fruit as well. It’s no surprise. We market ourselves based on our clean, green and safe production. But we cannot take that for granted.That’s why a few months ago we provided $200m to help exporters re-engage with international markets, and support firms looking to export for the first time. It’s also why we continue to expand our trade relationships. The limitations of the last few months didn’t stop us launching our free trade agreement talks with the UK - apparently Boris is interested in importing Orcs. And before that gets written up as a metaphor I’m pretty sure he meant it quite literally. I’m yet to break it to him that they are fictional – at least they are outside of politics anyway. But our position on the world stage will continue to be linked to the ability to come here. To be part of the culture of Aotearoa, to experience this place, our environment and our manaakitanga.We are investing $400 million in tourism because we know it is part of our future, and because open borders will be again too. It is not a matter of if, but when it is safe And on that, we already have work underway.We are progressing with all the checks and balances needed for a trans-Tasman bubble, and also on reconnecting with our Pacific neighbours. We have a framework in place that will help Cabinet make a decision on when quarantine free travel with these parts of the world should resume and more broadly, but only when it is safe to do so. Covid is hitting everyone hard, and it’s hit every aspect of our lives.So that’s what our response has had to do. That’s why our immediate response has been to be support our people, and invest in them. But as we move to recover and rebuild, we must also grow and create jobs, but not just any jobs, but the kind that supports the investment we are making in infrastructure, the environment, and our future. There wasn’t a playbook for Covid. There wasn’t a play book for the recovery. And speaking frankly, there hasn’t been one for much of what has happened this term. But as a team of 5 million we have achieved so much anyway. We have shown grit and determination. We have shown unity.We have shown a commitment to supporting one another.  And Labour has been there every step of the way. So today my ask of you is simple. Don’t put on the breaks when now more than ever is the time that we need to speed up.When we need to put people at the centre of our recovery.When we need to do what Labour has always done.So let’s keep up the momentum. Let’s keep rolling out our plan. Let’s keep rebuilding Let’s keep moving"
2020-07-01T22:40:38Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Dr David Clark                    ,  Statement from the Minister of Health Dr David Clark,"This morning I have formally tendered my resignation as Minister of Health, which was accepted by the Prime Minister.Serving as Minister of Health has been an absolute privilege – particularly through these extraordinary last few months.It’s no secret that Health is a challenging portfolio. I have given it my all.But it has become increasingly clear to me that my continuation in the role is detracting from the Government's overall response to the COVID-19 Global Pandemic. You will recall that I offered my resignation during the Level Four lockdown in response to mistakes I made in a personal capacity. The Prime Minister made it clear at the time - that under normal circumstances - she would have accepted that resignation, but she did not want significant disruption to the health system in the middle of the emergency response. I’ve always taken the view that the interests of the team must come first, and New Zealand’s COVID response is simply too important, so I have made the call that it is best for me to stand aside. We have now shifted to a more stable footing with no evidence of community transmission with the focus shifting to containing the virus at the border, it is appropriate for me to move on.I could not be more impressed with how New Zealanders and our health system responded to COVID-19. The response from health workers at the frontline has been astonishing, and I want to take this opportunity to thank all the medical, nursing and allied health staff who put themselves on the line to keep us all safe.Alongside the sacrifices made by ordinary New Zealanders, your combined efforts have put us in a position that is the envy of the world.  The results do speak for themselves. In global terms our low hospitalisation and mortality rate is a testament to the strength of our health system and its workers. Despite more than 80,000 tests in the past two weeks, the only cases we are identifying are at our borders.That is how the system is supposed to work.Because it has worked, we are now on a more stable footing. New Zealand's health system continues to build capacity to keep the virus at bay. Now is the right time to hand over the reins, and move forward with new leadership. It has been a privilege to serve in this role and lead the work to rebuild our public health system.We have made record investments in funding for DHBs, record investments in capital spending to rebuild our run-down hospitals and health facilities. We’ve made doctors’ visits cheaper for more than half a million Kiwis and free up to the age of 14.We’ve made historic investments into our mental health services, including sorting out pay for mental health support workers.We have hired more than 2000 more nurses – and increased their pay.We’ve established the Cancer Control Agency, Te Aho o te Kahu - quite aside from the day to day challenges in managing the system, these are significant achievements.It has been a busy but rewarding three years and I leave the role proud of all that we have achieved in that time. But it has not always been plain sailing and I wish to put on record again that I take full responsibility for the decisions made and taken during my time as Minister of Health. Although ministers are generally advised against being publicly effusive about public servants, I want to again put on the record that it has been an honour to work alongside an exceptional Director-General in Dr Ashley Bloomfield. Thank you Ashley and your team for the extraordinary work you have done for our country during our most serious health crisis in over a century. The time is now right to hand over to another Minister to drive forward the changes proposed in the Health and Disability System Review ably led by Heather Simpson. It is my sincere hope that a re-elected Labour-led Government will drive forward that agenda and that we continue to build a health service that is available and accessible to all New Zealanders, no matter who they are, where they are, or how deep their pocket.Before I take your questions, let me answer one of them in advance.With this decision comes the freedom to spend more time serving as a constituent MP.  I remain committed to the Labour Party, and to my electorate. So come the General Election on September 19 I will again be asking the people of Dunedin for their continued support to serve them as their local MP."

Special thanks to Victoria University for hosting this event. It is a pleasure to be here tonight to reflect on my time as Minister of Defence, and discuss New Zealand’s role as a contributor to regional and collective security. Over the past two and a half years as the Minister of Defence, I have focused on ensuring that Defence is a Force ready to respond to a range of operational requirements at the direction of the Government. It has been a privilege to hold this position. Tonight, I will discuss some specific areas of my portfolio that are likely of particular interest to this audience, including the international security environment, the strategic direction for Defence, our international relationships, deployments, as well as the role the NZDF has played in communities around New Zealand. Geopolitical arenaI will begin by identifying the key impacts COVID-19 is having on Defence. As we are all aware, the pandemic is having an extreme impact on the world, and in particular the global economy. The World Bank is forecasting the worst global recession since World War II and global unemployment is expected to rise to its highest level since 1965. Consequently, New Zealand will continue to navigate an increasingly complex and dynamic international security environment. The pandemic has resulted in further strain on the international rules-based order, which is foundational to our security. At the point when the world needs a coordinated global response more than ever, the global rules and institutions that support and sustain the system are under serious pressure, with consequences for New Zealand’s interests across the board.Although the full implications for global security will only become clear over time, the spread of COVID-19 has accentuated geopolitical shifts, tested the robustness of democratic governance, and increased social inequalities. The pandemic is one of a combination of forces increasing pressure on the international rules-based order.The three key forces are: States pursuing greater influence in ways that challenge international norms and at times the sovereignty of small states Challenges to open societies that threaten those states’ willingness to champion the rules-based order, and Complex disruptors that disproportionately affect open societies and weak states, and are forces for disorder.   With the backdrop of COVID-19 and a strained international environment, New Zealand is facing intensifying disruptors closer to home. These include, climate change, transnational organised crime and resource competition.  These forces will disrupt our neighbourhood, including our extensive maritime area, which covers 11% of the Earth’s surface, in complex and compounding ways. Further afield, the stability of the Asia-Pacific region is under pressure from a range of factors, from violent extremism in Southeast Asia to North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes.  Strategic direction for Defence How can we ensure New Zealand will be able to navigate these challenges?  We achieve this through our policy settings, which articulate and define how Defence responds to this evolving security environment. Over the past two and a half years, Defence has seen significant updates to its policy settings. This has included the introduction of the Community, Nation, World framework, which acknowledges the NZDF’s important role in supporting community wellbeing and national resilience.  An important theme that derives from this framework is Defence support to other agencies’ outcomes. Ministers from Social Development to Conservation, Customs and Police are all supported by Defence and have a stake in Defence. The establishment of  clear, concise “Defence Principles” articulate long-standing and widely held expectations of our Defence Force, and describe at a fundamental level what it is, and how it should operate and promote New Zealand’s interests and values. These include: Ensuring that Defence is combat capable, flexible and ready,Making sure our personnel have the resources to meet operational and strategic prioritiesAnd ensuring Defence is a credible and trusted international partner, particularly in our own region. This has lead us to place a greater emphasis on regional engagement, especially in the Pacific. New Zealand is a Pacific nation through geography, culture, identity, historical and economic linkages, and valued people-to-people ties. “He tini o ngā Iwi, engari, ko tētehi Moana nui-a-Kiwa”. “We are one Pacific of many nations. Many nations but one Pacific”. New Zealand is both in and of the Pacific, and our security and wellbeing are intrinsically bound to the peace and stability of the region. The Coalition Government has recognised challenges in our region, including climate change, economic resilience and human development as well as more contested strategic environment. As a result, the Pacific will require more humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, stability operations, and search and rescue missions. The Pacific Reset has responded to these challenges with a lift in our strategic ambition and investment in the region. The priority for our Defence Force to be able to respond in the Pacific is at the same level as our ability to operate in New Zealand’s own territory. This elevation represents a commitment by New Zealand Defence to be ready when called upon by our Pacific partners. Our goal is a stable, prosperous and resilient Pacific.Prioritising cooperation with likeminded partners is fundamental to achieving this. We can achieve more together than any of us could on our own. Together we work hard to promote strong, independent Pacific governance, human rights, rule of law and transparency - and we encourage other partners operating in the Pacific to respect these principles“Ehara taku toa I te toa taki tahi, engari he toa takitini”.  “My strength is not that of an individual but that of a collective”. When the effects of climate change intersect with a range of environmental and social issues, these can be significant contributors to both low-level and more violent conflict. New Zealand is now considered a world leader on climate change and security. As Minister of Defence, it has been a priority of mine to articulate the significant security challenges climate change will present for Defence in the coming decades. In consultation with the Minister for Climate Change, our Defence assessment demonstrates how the links between climate change and conflict are indirect but demonstrable. Reaching out across the aisle is a priority of mine, and lively discussions with colleagues from other political parties is something I do not shy away from. Climate change is a key example of my commitment to cross party and cross agency collaboration.International relationshipsTurning now to international relationships and engagements. Defence diplomacy has been a highlight for me over the past couple of years. A few stand-out moments come to mind - It was a privilege to share the stage at the 2019 Shangri-La Dialogue and speak alongside Dr Ng Eng Hen, Singapore’s Minister of Defence, a truly impressive statesman;I’ve particularly enjoyed forming close relationships and having frank discussions with Australian counterparts past and present, especially Ministers Marise Payne and Linda Reynolds; I’ve been hosted in far off places with such generosity and graciousness, including in Thailand, Fiji, PNG, China, Timor Leste and the UAE. I’ve also travelled to places most would never even imagine visiting, I of course think back to Antarctica, South Sudan and Iraq.   And in my capacity as Minister of Veterans I’ve been proud, and moved when paying my respects on visits to Kranji War Memorial in Singapore, or to Italy to represent the Government at the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Cassino.Despite COVID-19 preventing global travel, staying in touch with my counterparts has been a priority during the pandemic. I have had calls with my Tongan, Fijian, Singaporean, UAE and Japanese counterparts.  I also recently participated in a virtual Five Eyes Defence Ministerial Meeting. New Zealand benefits from close engagement with these partners. You may have seen these relationships highlighted in the media recently, with many of my ministerial colleagues also participating in virtual Five Eyes meetings over the past few weeks. I value the insights of these partners and the collaboration amongst us. Staying in contact with Five Eyes, sharing lessons learned is especially important during difficult times like we have experienced over the past few months. New Zealand and the US share a particularly longstanding friendship. This history is built on deep personal connections. During World War II more than 150,000 American service personnel came to New Zealand.  At the Pukeahu National War Memorial Park, there is a quote from U.S Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox in 1943. It reads…  “Together, in our strength, we shall keep that ocean – Pacific! As we are comrades in battle, so we shall be partners in victory. I salute the lands of the ANZACs as our companions in the peace that will follow, comrades and partners as an example to all the world of what can be accomplished by a fraternity of free men.”    I find this quote, despite being nearly 80 years old, effectively captures the essence of our enduring relationship. While New Zealand and the United States work together on a range of global issues, our cooperation and like-mindedness is now coming into sharper relief in the Asia-Pacific where the region is becoming more contested and its security is ever more fragile. My visit to China in 2019, where I addressed the Peoples’ Liberation Army National Defence University was an opportunity to reaffirm New Zealand’s values. I talked about how as beneficiaries of the international rules-based order we have the responsibility to step up, and safeguard it. We must face challenges together in practical ways, such as through cooperation in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief or peacekeeping. I reiterated the need for transparency, and frank conversations in order that we can cooperate in this shared commitment to peace and security. New Zealand continues to be concerned by developments in the South China Sea. New Zealand has consistently urged parties to resolve disputes peacefully in accordance with international law, and in particular the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.Across all our partners, New Zealand’s defence engagements are guided by our values. From Pacific Island Countries to China, to the US to NATO, we listen, we work to understand the needs of our partners and respect their perspectives and diverse identities.  When defence engages, when we deploy, these values are put into action. We stand up for what we believe in. Deployments It is imperative that we continue to contribute to collective security efforts where they are aligned with our values. It enables us to pursue an independent foreign policy and prosperity, and sets the foundation for our security.  Support for the international rules-based order is a key pillar of our independent foreign and defence policy. As such, New Zealand remains firmly committed to supporting the diplomatic efforts to achieve the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea, including through the implementation of the United Nations Security Council sanctions.In 2018 and 2019 we deployed a P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft in support of these sanctions as part of Operation Whio. These efforts are a key element of the global effort to persuade North Korea to abandon all of its nuclear weapons and nuclear programmes, as well as all other weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes.In the last few months, Cabinet has considered some of New Zealand’s deployments to the Middle East and Africa. This region is complex, and the operating environment is challenging. We see ongoing and pernicious threats of violent extremism, transnational organised crime, and threats to freedom of navigation. These challenges to the rules based order undermine the social fabric, have a global reach and impact on New Zealand’s prosperity, resilience and national security interests. We have a proud history of contributing to international efforts to counter these threats. Last year, I was privileged to visit our serving personnel across the Middle East and Africa.I saw first-hand how respected our personnel are, and what professionalism they bring to each mission. By working with partners, New Zealand personnel are helping to support peace, create stability, and ensure that our values are demonstrated across the globe. In March this year, marking another key milestone, saw the return to New Zealand of remaining personnel who served in Building Partner Capacity Programme at Camp Taji, Iraq. Since 2015 nearly 1000 NZDF personnel have deployed to Taji in order to train the Iraqi Security Forces and provide mentoring support. In concert with our Australian partners, over 47,000 ISF personnel were trained by this mission, including Federal Police. While the Building Partner Capacity mission was successful in completing its objectives, we recognise that the work in Iraq is not over. ISIS – while territorially defeated – continues to commit horrific atrocities and human rights abuses. Even now, when the world is gripped by a pandemic, ISIS continues to call for its members to exploit the confusion, and gain further footholds across the region, and further afield. New Zealand remains committed to the work of the Defeat ISIS Coalition, and in May agreed to retain staff officers in the region, which provide support in a number of headquarter roles, including support to training, planning, logistics and legal advice. 31 of our troops are deployed to the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai, Egypt. New Zealand has contributed to the MFO since 1982, when I was among the first tranche of officers deployed to the mission. A New Zealander, Major General Evan Williams currently holds the position of Force Commander and is serving with mana, steering the 1200-strong mission through these uncertain times. General Williams is the third New Zealander to hold the appointment.New Zealand also has a range of personnel in other theatres. This includes Jordan, South Sudan, Lebanon, the Golan Heights and Afghanistan, demonstrating New Zealand’s steadfast commitment to the maintenance of the international rules-based order. Domestic story Domestically, the NZDF has had to be prepared to respond to a range of unpredictable events. The last three years have seen major challenges confronting New Zealand and our wider region, including the March 15th attack, the White Island disaster, the Australian bushfires, Cyclone Harold in the Pacific, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. Through these periods of uncertainty, the Defence Force was prepared to respond to these events at the direction of the Government, and I am proud of the way Defence has conducted itself during these challenging times. This Coalition Government is dedicated to ensuring that the Defence Force will be able to continue to deliver value to the community, nation and world for decades to come. Our investment in long term capabilities is a reflection of this commitment. With strong backing across the Coalition Government, we have delivered the greatest injection of defence funding in decades, with $4.3 billion in operating and capital funding allocated in total across the past three Budgets. The planned $20 billion capital envelope out to 2030 demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that the Defence Force have the capability to deliver what we ask of them. The purchase of five C-130J-30 Super Hercules transport aircraft as well as the four P-8 Poseidon are once in a generation investment that will ensure the Defence Force has the capability it needs to carry out future tasking’s on behalf of all New Zealanders. HMNZS Manawanui has been successfully conducting sea trials in New Zealand and is proving to be a highly capable vessel. This vessel is a game-changer for the disaster relief, search and recovery and explosives disposal work the NZDF does in the South Pacific region. The arrival of HMNZS Aotearoa in New Zealand last week, the Navy’s largest ever vessel, is also an exciting development for our Defence Force. This capability will enable Defence to contribute to combat operations, humanitarian relief functions and operational and training support. Aotearoa will provide global sustainment to New Zealand and coalition maritime and air units, as well as United Nations security operations. She boasts state of the art features that include ice-strengthening and winterisation features, meaning this capability will be able to sustain New Zealand’s presence in Antarctica.  The benefit these procurements provide to New Zealand’s diplomatic and trade relationships is substantial, as we are demonstrating to our international counterparts that New Zealand is serious in its commitment to ensuring the security and prosperity of our community, nation and world. To conclude, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you all tonight about these important topics. While there may be a number of challenges ahead, I take great comfort in recognising New Zealand’s reputation as one of the most trusted and respected Defence partners in the world. Our values, our integrity and our mana will enable us to deal with whatever challenges lie ahead.  Kei a tātou tēnei ao, kei a tātau hoki ēnei iti kahurangi. This is our world; these are the challenges we must strive to overcome.  He waka eke noa. We are all in this together. "

Mr Speaker, racing has a long and proud history in New Zealand.  And this bill closes the circle started by Sir Thaddeus McCarthy with his Royal Commission report of December 1970. As an industry Racing is seriously important to our communities and regions. Past studies says it contributes $1.6 billion to the economy each year.  There are 14 thousand full time racing industry jobs and nearly 58,000 jobs which participate in the industry in some shape – from vets to equipment supplies.There are 15000 owners, 800 trainers, and 200 jockeys.  Not only is New Zealand bloodstock world class – it is a significant export earner.The world class quality of this industry has no better example than the Cambridge Stud horse “Hello Youmzain” winning the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at the Royal Ascot this week. That was a genuine world class result.Yet it has been well documented our racing industry has been underperforming over recent years.Addressing and reversing this decline has been my focus as Minister for Racing – given weight with racing policy being part of the Coalition Agreement.The government’s first step was to commission the Australian expert John Messara to conduct an industry wide review.We then formed a Ministerial Advisory Committee which pulled together our own domestic experts to examine next steps.These measures lead to the precursor Racing Reform Bill which passed through this house last year, creating the first meaningful change this industry had seen in a long time. Significantly, the NZ Racing Board was replaced with the Racing Industry Transition Agency (RITA) to start a reform programme.Officials also worked on developing further the Messara recommendations.And now we before us we have the Racing Industry Bill - the substantive legislative response to the Messara report.This Bill revokes the Racing Act 2003.It provides a new governance structure for the racing industry.It creates TAB NZ as the sole betting provider for racing and sport, and empowers the three racing codes to take responsibility for the future growth of their respective industries.The Bill also establishes the Racing Integrity Board (RIB), an entity independent from the racing codes, which is responsible for all integrity functions for the industry.Mr Speaker, when introduced – we said we would listen to sound submissions.In order to address historical property issues that have contributed to the industry’s decline, the Bill introduces provisions to ensure that surplus racing property is vested back into the industry to enable its future growth.But the provisions related to race tracks have been carefully considered and are well balanced.  They ensure there is good process and protection for community interests. Mr Speaker, the Transport and Infrastructure Committee received written submissions from 922 submitters. This was supplemented by many oral submissions, the vast majority expressed general support for this Bill. Mr Speaker, the Committee has unanimously reported the Bill back to the House with proposed amendments. The government has accepted these amendments.The interest, and productive contributions, submitted to the members of the select committee are welcomed, and my parliamentary colleagues should be thanked for their consideration of these matters.This Minister has been vigilant with following the progress of this bill, both listening carefully to industry, and also receiving a consistent stream of advice from officials. The government’s objective has always been to achieve racing legislation responding to the intent of the Messara review, and to respond to the feedback of the industry.  And this government has delivered that with a bill which reflects the government’s sense of direction.Mr Speaker, the Government believes the racing codes need the tools to better manage their own destiny rather than be bound by legislative impediments. The government also welcomes the provision for Racing New Zealand within the Bill to be a collaborative entity of the codes.The Government also supports reduced ministerial involvement in the industry – as many in the industry called for.  The overarching intent of the Bill is to be able to create the opportunity for the clubs, codes and TAB to foster their own future.It is important to advise the House that since the Select Committee reported back further amendments have become necessary as a result of COVID-19. The required changes will be addressed by the Government through a Supplementary Order Paper at the Committee of the Whole stage. The Supplementary Order Paper will amend the Bill as reported back to allow the current RITA Board to remain as the inaugural TAB NZ Board until such time as new appointments can be made under the new legislation. This recognises the delays to the passing of the Bill caused by COVID-19 would have meant that appointing a new board would occur in the pre-election period - I will leave the decisions on the substantive appointments to the TAB NZ until after the next election.The Supplementary Order Paper will also temporarily extend the Minister for Racing’s transitional powers currently provided for in the Racing Act to allow the Minister to give direction to TAB NZ for the immediate post-COVID recovery period.As you will be aware the government has delivered a significant rescue package for racing in the wake of COVID-19.This investment has created a similar period of industry adjustment in which a closer degree of Government involvement is appropriate given the scale of taxpayers’ investment.While the use of these powers may not be required, their retention allows the Minister to assist the TAB NZ board by providing clear direction through what may be a challenging time. This provision is temporary and time locked to the COVID response.The Supplementary Order Paper also makes minor technical changes to the Bill that have come to light since the Select Committee process. These are all within the intent of the Bill and the changes made by the Select Committee.Mr Speaker, in conclusion, let me commend this Bill to the house.It implements urgently required reforms. It gives the industry the tools in needs to revitalise itself. And it is catalyst for a better future for the Racing industry.  To accept the status quo and to do nothing would only lead to inevitable decline.This bill will turn the industry around and get racing back on track.And I am pleased to note that the industry is already responding and good work is underway to achieve these goals.Accordingly, I commend this Bill to the House.Ends "

On a day like today, in the middle of winter, 30 June 1997, Justice Sir Thomas Thorp presented his Review of Firearms Control in New Zealand.The Napier-born Sir Thomas passed away in 2018. But his colleague, Simon Mount QC, has been closely following the passage of this legislation.I would like to quote a message from Simon received this week.“Sir Thomas would have been pleased to see so many of his recommendations implemented in this Bill.  He had a strong affinity with New Zealand’s firearms owners, and he knew how important firearms are for many sections of New Zealand’s community.  He worked extremely hard to meet with and listen to gun owners, and he respected those for whom firearms are vital tools or sporting equipment.  He also valued personal responsibility and public safety highly, and he worked hard to find recommendations that struck the right balance for New Zealand.  He had a deeply practical streak alongside his broad intelligence, and he wanted a firearms regime that would work in the real world.  He knew that effective firearms regulation is not easy, and no laws, no matter how good, can prevent all harm.  After years of waiting, he would have been very pleased to see Parliament finally adopt the key planks of the system he believed would give New Zealand the best chance of reducing harm.""Mr Speaker, the 15th of March 2019 will always be a devastating day in our history.But it does not define us.What defines us is how we reacted; the actions we took.There were so many brave people who stopped directly in harm’s way to help victims; running into live fire, some knowingly giving their life to save others. Families and friends sacrificed themselves and put others first on that day. People who were passing by stopped to rescue victims and take them to safe shelter. Police and emergency services rushed to the scene. And we know two of Police’s brave officers managed to locate and stop the killer, and prevent the horror from continuing. So many people rushed to help.I am proud of our response as a nation, of every person who took some small action to show support and solidarity, and especially of those courageous people who risked their own safety.I am also proud of most of my fellow MPs in this chamber.It's been nearly a year since that day and we’ve achieved a great deal. We’ve achieved what previous governments could not.We have collected, destroyed, or modified almost 64,000 firearms (59k buyback and amnesty, 5k modification) and destroyed more than 227,000 prohibited parts and large capacity magazines. But we do not stop with that. As a Government we took a comprehensive, system-wide approach to the risk management of firearms use. That brings us to the Bill before us today.The Third Reading of the Arms Legislation Bill is an historic milestone for community safety. We know we always have more work to do to make New Zealand a safer place. This is another significant step along the way.The new law is designed to stop firearms falling into the wrong hands. It spells out for the first time that owning a firearm is a privilege, limited to responsible licensed owners.The most significant change is the new firearms register. Successive governments have failed to deliver a register since it was first recommended by Sir Thomas Thorp in 1997. This will finally track how many firearms are in legal circulation, who holds them, who is selling them, and who is buying them.Once the register is established every licence holder has up to five years to register their guns. They will need to keep updating the register as they buy or sell guns. It allows us to link firearms to licence holders, return stolen firearms to their legitimate owner, and hold licence holders to account for the safe storage and possession of firearms. We need to ensure that every part of our risk-management system – from licensing processes, to security requirements, and the firearms themselves – is robust. We don’t want anyone to have access to dangerous assault weapons, or to be able to slip through a crack, or manipulate the system. Which is why we have expanded the definition of prohibited firearms and prohibited those types of pistols that were really short MSSAs.We need checks and assurance across the entire system.This comprehensive risk management approach means a number of changes.  The changes we’re making to the Act touch on those key points where it is essential to mitigate risk.Risks include unsafe use of firearms, or illegal possession of firearms.These changes include those that take effect immediately following Royal Assent, expected next week:Reduced length of firearms licence from 10 to 5 years for first time licence holders and those who have previously had their licence revoked or allowed it to expire; Offences and penalties have been changed to better reflect the seriousness of the offending. Examples include possessing a firearm without a licence which now has a penalty of up to one year in prison or a $15,000 fine (3 months or $1,000 under old system); and selling a firearm to an unlicensed person which carries up to a two year jail sentence or $20,000 fine (3 months or $1,000 under old system); Further high-risk firearms are prohibited including short (pistol-length) semi-automatic rifles. There are new requirements for lawful possession of a pistol carbine conversion kit which converts a pistol into a shoulder-fired firearm;  Endorsements for pest control now have a shorter duration and will need to be renewed before the firearms licence expires;More people involved in agricultural and similar businesses can obtain endorsements to possess prohibited firearms where it can be clearly demonstrated these are needed for pest control purposes;  Those who come to New Zealand who are issued a licence for up to a year (a ‘Visitors’ licence) will no longer be able to purchase and take ownership of a firearm in New Zealand.A Ministerial Arms Advisory group will be established to ensure there is ongoing support and advice on firearms matters.Some changes will follow over a three year period. These include:New rules will take effect in six months to determine who is “fit and proper” to possess firearms and who will be disqualified from holding a firearms licence. The “fit and proper” person status is at the core of any application for a firearms licence. Every person applying must be responsible and trustworthy enough to earn the privilege of holding a firearms licence;There will be new rules in one year governing a gun dealer’s licence, to recognise the range of dealer activities  and associated risks of theft or misuse of firearms;In six months’ time anyone who sells ammunition will need a firearms licence;After two years there will be new requirements for shooting clubs and ranges, which previously were not governed by law. It gives all club committees (including those of pistol clubs) the statutory ability to enforce their own rules around membership and use of ranges.To satisfy the public and licence holders that the changes we have made are delivering on the intent we have brought forward the timeframe for reviewing the Arms Act from five years to three years.  This will include a review of the Act’s offences and penalties and the registry.We appreciate the contribution from the firearms community throughout all these changes. We have had healthy debates and worked to keep people safe. I thank them for their time and your support. No doubt some of them will keep providing that support through the Arms Advisory Group which will be established under these new laws.Its members will be people with knowledge and experience from both inside and outside the firearms community who will help advise me on matters such as legislative proposals and policies that contribute to the safe use and control of firearms.At the heart of the new laws is a new principle; that the possession and use of arms is a privilege. We must always remember that with this privilege, comes responsibility.And that is what our changes to this Act ensure. That every person involved with firearms has to act in the interests of safety.ConclusionMr Speaker, I mentioned at the start of my speech that Sir Thomas was a Napier boy.He watched his father rebuild his business after the devastation of the Hawke’s Bay earthquake.We too, have been devastated by the loss of life on 15 March, and the harm caused by gun crime.To quote from the obituary for Sir Thomas in the Law Society journal in 2018:""He had an eye for the big picture and the future, and never stopped looking for ways the system could be improved.""  That must be the duty of this Parliament too.Sir Thomas, this is for you."
2020-06-11T00:33:36Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Phil Twyford                    ,  Speech to the Aviation Sector June 2020,"Kia ora tatouToday I want to set out for you our Government’s thinking on the journey so far and what the flight path ahead looks like.But firstly, I want to acknowledge how your industry has pulled together to come through this crisis.The last three months have turned the world upside down and aviation was not only one of the first hit, but the worst hit. The International Civil Aviation Organization estimates there are going to be up to 3 billion fewer passengers travelling by air this year and that means up to 402 billion (USD) in lost revenue from airlines alone. They estimate a loss of 57% or over 97 billion (USD) for airports this year compared to pre-Covid forecast revenues. Our Government recognised the impact of the pandemic was going to be huge, and it’s why we went hard and we went early. One of the ways we moved early to support firms was through introducing the wage subsidy to help business retain their highly skilled staff. Support is also on the way for businesses facing cash-flow issues – by placing existing debt into hibernation until they can start trading normally again. We have also moved to provide interest free loans to small business to give some much needed cash-flow by providing assistance of up to $100,000 to firms employing 50 or fewer staff.It’s also why we set aside $600 million of the COVID-19 relief package early on to directly support the aviation system.When we introduced the package, New Zealand’s borders remained open to all but Chinese and Iranian travellers, and the Alert Level system had not yet been introduced. It’s hard to believe this was less than three months ago (March 19). We stepped in to fund things like air traffic control and security screening that the aviation industry normally pay themselves and stopping any increases to fees for the next year.And we moved quickly to ensure New Zealand has the supplies it needs and to back our exporters.Our national carrier, Air New Zealand stepped up and worked with NZTE to keep vital goods such as medical supplies and food flowing freely during those initial few weeks. CEO of New Zealand King Salmon, Grant Roswarne has thanked everyone involved for listening to the challenges for exporters sending high value perishable goods overseas.With the cancellation of the majority of passenger air routes out of New Zealand, a key challenge for King Salmon was access to air freight to send their salmon to their main markets in North America and Japan.It would not have been possible without Air NZ’s support and willingness to try new ways of working in those early days. Another example of them stepping up was very early on in February with the Wuhan charter flight.They worked hard with the NZ and Chinese governments to make it work and 20 Air NZ crew volunteered to get Kiwis home when there weren’t any flights at all. Thank you to those staff and others who have been at the forefront. I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the level of change Air NZ is going through right now.They aren’t perfect, but you have to recognise that they have gone from a $5.8 billion a year in revenue to less than $500 million a year pretty much overnight.Thousands of staff have been let go.I can’t imagine the pain the staff and the organisation are going through. Our Government recognises how important Air New Zealand is as our national carrier and its unique and critical role in our economy and society.It is critical that it survives this pandemic to fight another day, which is why we have given them a $900 million loan to keep them afloat.Coming back to the wider picture, I want to thank everyone who has helped keep essential freight flowing to and from NZ.Through the International Airfreight Capacity scheme, the Government appointed Air New Zealand, China Airlines, China Southern, Emirates, Freightways Express, Qantas and Tasman Cargo.They are doing 58 cargo flights a week to key export and import markets like China, Japan, Australia, the US and the Pacific Islands. This is no doubt helping with our economic recovery and we appreciate them working with us. Airports have also stepped up to help during this time. Christchurch Airport acted as a coordinators with smaller local freight companies and teamed up to with them to help with the Ministry of Transport process. Because of this coordinating role, Air NZ, Emirates, and Qantas all are now serving the South Island with vital freight routes. These have proved very successful with last Wednesday being a record freight day in Christchurch.Two Emirates 777s picked up over 80 tonnes of freight when normally there would just be one 777. The certainty of air freight services into Christchurch also saw logistics companies commit to around $30 million of new facilities at Christchurch Airport during lockdown. This will create new local construction jobs over the coming year.This is a direct result of the Government and the sector working together, and I want to acknowledge the Ministry of Transport officials administering the scheme, along with Malcolm Johns and the rest of the team and Christchurch Airport.  However, we know that we can’t just focus on freight. Essential Aviation Transport Connectivity ProgrammeAs our response to COVID-19 evolves, we have set up a new support scheme for Essential Aviation Transport Connectivity – drawn from the $600 million aviation relief package.This programme will support domestic passenger airlines and airports that provide essential regional connectivity, and to ensure operation of services necessary for the running of our aviation system.  Funding will only be available in the short to medium term - until domestic passenger numbers increase enough for them to be self-sustaining. Support from the government should be seen as the last available option and operators must have made effective use of the support measures available under the Government’s COVID-19 Economic Response Package, and have taken all available and reasonable operational and commercial measures to ride-out the impact of COVID-19.                                                 Officials are already working with some applicants for this Essential Aviation Connectivity programme.  I look forward to making an announcement on the first recipient soon.Trans-Tasman Bubble and the futureNow let’s turn to what’s next for aviation. The move to Alert level 1 is really positive for the sector – physical distancing is no longer required and I’m sure Kiwis will feel more comfortable flying given the progress the team of five million has made.And while we know our international borders will effectively be closed for some time, work continues on a trans-Tasman bubble. I’d like to acknowledge the work of the Australia New Zealand Leadership Forum and the Trans-Tasman Safe Border Group. In particular I want to recognise the work and advocacy of Adrian Littlewood and Group co-chair Scott Tasker, both from Auckland Airport. Both Governments have received the advice of the Trans-Tasman Safe Border Group and officials are working through the details of implementation.Once that work is completed, it will be up to both Governments to agree on timing.Everyone is extremely motivated to make it happen as quickly as possible. I don’t think I need to tell you that it will be a lifeline to tourism given Australia is New Zealand’s largest source of international tourists (in 2019, 1.4 million Australians visited New Zealand). There will be more opportunities SMEs to travel to expand their business and 75% of New Zealand’s export businesses traditionally derive income from Australia.Our goal is to continue looking for opportunities and expand our bubble to other countries.We will only extend our bubble to other countries as long as they meet stringent public health criteria; including no unchecked community transmission, good testing and contact tracing capability, and strong border controls.    Given our proximity and good relationships, it makes sense that the pacific countries are the next cabs off the rank.To date the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu have remained COVID-free by adopting a very low or zero risk approach, while Fiji has effectively managed its small outbreak of cases through strict public health measures.  A number of Pacific countries are signalling their readiness to consider free movement of people with New Zealand when the time is right, informed by their level of confidence in New Zealand’s Covid-19 response.Extending our bubble further all depends on the public health response of different countries and their willingness to work together. It’s been reported that it likely will be a couple of years before a vaccine is created and widely distributed. We are very unlikely to go back to 600 international flights a week before then, but I am hopeful we can reach a new normal where travel will steadily ramp back up as we expand our bubble to more countries.And we are encouraging Kiwis to back their backyard through a new domestic campaign from Tourism NZ.Kiwis spent $9 billion a year on overseas travel before the Covid-19 pandemic and we hope the campaign will encourage people to spend as much on domestic holidays as they did overseas.Domestic travel demand should gradually return while we are in Alert Level 1 and tourism operators will no doubt be wanting to work with the sector to help bring tourists to their patch. ConclusionIn conclusion, we want to ensure our aviation sector can emerge strongly from this crisis and provide air connectivity for business, domestic tourism and freight movements.I acknowledge this has been an extremely disruptive and challenging time for the aviation sector.This Government is doing what it takes to cushion the blow, support the aviation system and workers, and position the economy for recovery. Now we all have a part to play in rebuilding New Zealand.Thank you.Given the size of this forum, we’ve asked for questions to be sent in advance as it would be extremely challenging to take questions from you all.  As sector representatives, John from the Aviation Industry Association, Ian from the Aviation Federation and Justin from BARNZ have all agreed to pose these questions on your behalf. Over to you John. "
2020-06-08T04:38:23Z,                                                                                                                    Hon David Parker                    ,  Trade strategy for the recovery from the impacts of Covid-19,"Launch of the Government’s Trade Recovery Strategy - June 8, 2020Welcome everyone here today and watching online.Before I get to our Trade Recovery Strategy, I want to begin by telling you a bit about the work we did when the crisis hit us and how New Zealand trade policy responded. As the crisis unfolded internationally, I was alarmed at the sudden uptick in protectionist measures. At one point nearly 80 WTO Members had more than 100 new restrictions or other barriers in place. To make matters worse, some of the major economies began to introduce subsidies for their farmers. The direction of travel was worrying. As the crisis unfolded, we were intensely focused on protecting New Zealand trade and supply links. This was to ensure that New Zealanders could continue to access essential goods – medicines, PPE, COVID-19 testing kits and so on - as well as keeping New Zealand goods flowing to our trading partners.  For example, the New Zealand – Singapore Air Freight Project is one example. It has helped with access to essential medical supplies brought in through Singapore, while at the same time meeting Singapore’s food security needs with New Zealand agricultural exports.In terms of wider trade policy, our immediate response to this crisis has been a combination of energetic trade diplomacy and reform. One of my first phone calls was to my Singaporean colleagues. Together we agreed that as small, trade-dependent countries we couldn’t stand by as the old certainties about the benefits of trade were washed away. We committed to push back together on what we were seeing internationally. Within 24 hours, we had a bilateral statement issued and three working days later, seven other countries, including our closest partner Australia. And other P4 partners Brunei and Chile joined us, along with G7 economy Canada and others. We all agreed to sustain trade and supply chain connectivity, particularly for essential medical goods and food. The Statement now has 11 participants. This Joint Statement was important because it sent a signal about the contribution international trade can make to address the challenges we face with COVID-19. In short, we were making real my firm belief that international cooperation – not national protectionism - is the best way to address a global challenge. With signatories to the statement growing in both numbers and collective economic heft, we’re also demonstrating that New Zealand is not alone in this belief.In practical terms, New Zealand also immediately gave effect to this statement by unilaterally suspending tariffs on medical and PPE-related goods. In some countries, tariffs on imported medical equipment and supplies will be hindering their Covid response by increasing the cost of the goods through tariffs. Alongside this unilateral action, and in parallel with the Joint Ministerial Statement, we also concluded a negotiation on essential COVID-19 goods with Singapore.  The New Zealand-Singapore Declaration on Trade in Essential Goods removes tariffs and expedites trade flows on a wide range of COVID-19 response-related products. Again, this gives real substance to the objectives of the Joint Statement. We also joined another Ministerial Statement together with Singapore, Canada, Korea and Australia, aimed at facilitating the flow of goods and services as well as the essential movement of people. In addition to reiterating our commitment to avoiding supply chain disruptions and protectionist trade measures, we also opened the door to working together to eventually facilitate the resumption of essential cross-border travel, while still of course safeguarding public health goals. These initiatives are an important counterpoint to the array of restrictions we’ve seen some countries rush to implement. And while we were doing all this, we also worked on the nuts and bolts of international trade – by looking to resuscitate our air links and connectivity by standing up an air freight facility to support trade flows.This followed on from ministers’ calls to various airlines and countries as the crisis unfolded, when we discussed the desirability of all countries doing their bit to sustain air and sea transport links. In addition to meeting New Zealand’s critical trade needs, as the crisis unfolded, it was about laying the foundation stones for our short to medium term trade recovery strategy, which involves a significant recalibration of our approach to trade policy.In my opinion most countries will consider whether increased stockpiles or local manufacturing capacity of some medicines, PCR testing reagents and PPE is needed. This is already provided for under our trade agreements. That does not mean we will manufacture cars or computers. We will remain reliant on trade to export what we produce well in order to fund the imports we need. There is no question that trade will be a critical enabler of economic recovery post COVID-19.  Who it is with depends upon reciprocal relations.With one in four New Zealanders’ jobs dependent on exports; and our knowledge that exporting firms are more productive, employ more staff and pay better wages; it is clear that rebuilding our international connectivity in general, and our tradeable sector in particular, can help drive our recovery, including an expansion in employment, incomes, innovation and productivity. The Trade Recovery Strategy I’m outlining today sets out how we’re going to achieve that, from helping businesses get through the disruption of a global pandemic to recalibrating trade policy to navigate a turbulent environment. We want to protect the global trade systems and rules that have served New Zealand so well over many years and ensure we are best placed to seize new opportunities for exports and investment.None of us are under any illusions about the scale of the task. The current global shock from COVID-19 is both a demand and a supply-side shock and that makes it particularly challenging for New Zealand; an open and internationally-connected economy. The World Trade Organisation’s Trade Forecast predicts that world merchandise trade will reduce by between 13 and 32% in 2020. The OECD estimated in April that on average the drop in economic output in each country caused by Covid-19 is equivalent to a decline in GDP of 2% for each month that strict virus containment measures continue. The trade challenges caused by Covid-19 are occurring against a backdrop of what were already turbulent times. Even before COVID-19 hit, the “Golden Weather” for New Zealand trade policy – which we enjoyed between 1995 and 2019 – had well and truly ended. Our long-term trade strategy was designed to be able to adapt – by shifting our points of emphasis - for precisely the kinds of challenges we see ahead of us today. Now we face greater headwinds as nationalism and protectionism become more pervasive and entrenched, global demand drops, businesses look to shorten supply chains and travel restrictions affect tourism and education. Looking at our own statistics we can see there are challenges ahead, but with the right trade recovery strategy, and by working closely with exporters to ensure that strategy reflects their needs and priorities, we can navigate through this. Our overall goods exports, concentrated in the primary sector, have remained largely steady throughout the pandemic, although there was a 4% dip for the month of April, compared to the previous year. According to provisional figures from 1 February to 13 May, goods exports were valued at $18.1 billion, only slightly down on $18.3 billion for the same period in 2019 and still at record levels compared to all other years.  By contrast, goods imports have dropped significantly during the same time period from $17 billion to $15.7 billion – the decline is accounted for predominantly by non-agricultural goods.  Our key exporting services sectors – education and tourism have been very hard hit by our necessary border restrictions. Overseas visitor arrivals in April were virtually zero while 307,000 people arrived in April last year.    A 2021 global trade recovery is predicted and I am optimistic that this will be the case for New Zealand as well. Much hinges though on the duration of the pandemic internationally and how effective trading nations are in responding to it.For New Zealand’s part, we will be implementing our new Trade Recovery Strategy, designed to get our export sector back up and running and contributing to wider economic recovery. There are three inter-related elements to the Strategy. I would be happy to go in to further detail about any of these, but briefly, they are:Supporting exporters;An additional $216 million over four years allocated to NZTE in last month’s Budget will enable them to offer in-market services to twice as many exporters. They currently focus on 700 high growth firms. That is doubled to 1400 with improved internet-based services to other exporters. Combined with increased emphasis on cross-agency support to businesses both offshore and in New Zealand from MFAT and other agencies, this will help the export sector to weather the disruptions brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthen its role as a driver of economic growth.Reinvigorating international trade architecture; COVID-19, and the worrying trend towards protectionism that it has exacerbated, have reinforced New Zealand’s need for a functioning, rules-based international trading system. We will be working to shore up the World Trade Organisation, as well as expanding and developing our network of regional and bilateral FTAs Speaking of bilateral negotiations I want to mention recent news of a supposedly leaked agricultural access offer on the EU FTA negotiations. I am disappointed by the leak and am even more disappointed by the quality of what we are being offered. Let me be very clear - this latest offer reflects agricultural protectionism in the EU. It is a very negative signal especially at a time when we are working together in the WTO and elsewhere encouraging countries not to be protectionist and to ensure trade can flow freely between us. For NZ exporters to face an “unlevel playing field” in the EU is unacceptable. To take one example in terms of the recent leaked offer – in 2019 the EU exported to us here – tariff free – the equivalent of just under a kilogram of cheese per New Zealander to New Zealand. By comparison the EU is offering access for just over 3 grams of New Zealand cheese per EU citizen – and even that is subject to volume restrictions and a prohibitively high tariff. This is not a workable way to conclude our long-running negotiations.As a country we cannot afford for that situation to remain. It is clear that the EU will need to address this imbalance. How else, post-Covid, would New Zealand maintain a social licence for trade? I am speaking tonight with my counterpart EU Trade Commissioner Hogan to register very clearly my dissatisfaction and disappointment with this offer, as well as the fact of its leak.  Refreshing key trade relationships The disruptions caused by COVID-19 have highlighted the importance of providing our exporters with access to a wide range of markets. While the decisions about where to export and how to diversify are ultimately down to them, providing new or expanded access through our forward pipeline of FTA negotiations to markets like the EU, UK and South America will give them more options to work with. Finally, our Trade Recovery Strategy is underpinned by our Trade for All agenda, as we respond to the social and economic impacts of COVID-19.  Late last year the Trade For All Advisory Board presented a series of recommendations on how New Zealand trade policy can better deliver for all New Zealanders.  The work that we were doing to respond to these recommendations just before the lock down is reflected in how we’re approaching the trade recovery strategy. While I strongly believe that we need trade to get us through this crisis, I also believe that trade must work for all New Zealanders. ENDS "
2020-06-08T03:24:55Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  New Zealand moves to Alert Level 1,"Today is day 26 of Alert Level 2 and day 17 without any new cases of Covid-19 in the country. Today is also day 75 of being in a Covid alert level of any kind.Our team of 5 million has both sacrificed and achieved a huge amount in just under 11 weeks as the world reckoned with, and continues to reckon with, a virus that went from obscurity at the start of the year to a global pandemic that will linger, with second waves a constant reality.As it spread rapidly around the world, we all saw people losing their loved ones and their livelihoods at a rate that was never acceptable to us.And so here in New Zealand we went hard and early with a single plan that had a dual purpose – and to protect lives and livelihoods.Self isolation for all returning travellers came into place first – 17 days after our first case. We closed our borders to everyone but New Zealanders 20 days after our first case.Our first economic package, including the critically important wage subsidy scheme, was in place 19 days after the first case. Most other countries took more than 40. And then New Zealanders did something remarkable in our fight to beat Covid-19. We united in unprecedented ways to crush the virus.Our lockdown was in place 26 days after our first case, when we had just over 200 cases. Google tracking showed that during our lockdown, New Zealanders massively reduced their movements – by 91 per cent to retail and recreation – better than Australia, the UK, the United States, and nearly every other place we compare ourselves to.Had we not acted, 11 days in to our lockdown we were projected to have 4000 cases. We had 1000 and one of the lowest rates per capita in the world.That was what the sacrifice of our team of 5 million was for. To keep one another safe, and to keep one another well.And as much as we could, we have. We acknowledge those we have lost in our battle to beat Covid-19.Our goal was also to come out the other side as quickly and as safely as we could.A place where our borders continue to be our first line of defence but where all current rules and restrictions on businesses and services are essentially lifted. Where all the rules for hospitality, such as single service, separated tables, and people being seated, all end. Where there is no requirement for physical distancing in workplaces and in public places. Where all gatherings of any size can occur. Where life feels as normal as it can in the time of a global pandemic.And today, 75 days later, we are ready. Today, there are no active cases in New Zealand.We have tested almost 40,000 people for Covid-19 in the past 17 days and none have tested positive.We have had no one in hospital with Covid-19 for 12 days.It’s been 40 days since the last case of community transmission, 22 days since that person finished their self-isolation.And so today I can announce that Cabinet has agreed we will now move to Level 1 – to get our economy fully open again – and we will start almost immediately.We move down to Covid-19 Alert Level 1 from midnight tonight. With over 100,000 new cases being reported each day, the challenge of Covid remains around the globe and so it remains here. We are not immune to what is happening in the rest of the world.But unlike the rest of the world, not only have we protected New Zealanders’ health, we now have a head-start on our economic recovery.  That’s because at Level 1 we become, if not the most open, one of the most open economies in the world. Oxford University publishes a Government response stringency index, ranking countries from 0 to 100 in terms of their level of restrictions. Before today’s move to Level 1, New Zealand was at 33.3, while Australia was at 62.5. We were already nearly twice as open as they were.The Reserve Bank’s analysis shows the economy under Level 1 is expected to be operating just 3.8 per cent below normal levels.That’s an improvement from the estimated 8.8 per cent below normal under Level 2, 19 per cent below normal under Level 3, and 37 per cent under Level 4.And it was encouraging to see economists recognise that activity under Level 2 was also stronger than expected. Westpac last week said the economic recovery was tracking faster than expected, and that activity like heavy and light traffic movement, and electricity use is back to, or above, pre-Covid levels.Zespri too has reported that despite the global challenge of Covid, its exports are well ahead of last year, with 5.7 million more trays shipped this season so far than last season along with its highest sales yet in Europe as demand for healthy produce grows.At Level 1, we expect the continuation of recovery.After all, at Level 1 we can hold public events without limitations.Private events such as weddings, functions and funerals without limitations.Retail is back without limitations.Hospitality is back without limitations.Public transport and travel across the country is fully opened.This freedom from restrictions relies though heavily on the ongoing role that our border controls will play in keeping the virus out.We must remain mindful of the global situation and the harsh reality that the virus will be in our world for some time to come.We are confident we have eliminated transmission of the virus in New Zealand for now, but elimination is not a point in time – it is a sustained effort.We almost certainly will see cases here again – I want to say again, we will almost certainly see cases here again – but when that occurs it will not mean we have failed. It is the reality of this virus. We must be and we are prepared for future cases.That’s the reasons our border remains our first line of defence as we aim not to import the virus. Borders remain closed at 15 of 17 comparable countries.Our managed isolation and quarantine at the border will continue and it will be as important as ever as we know this is a potential pathway.And that is key because we want to not just move to Level 1 – we want to stay there. And so there is a key ask I have of all of you today, of businesses.We are asking all businesses and services where the public visit or enter to provide people the opportunity to maintain their own diaries of where they’ve been.And so our All of Government team will continue working with sector groups, businesses, hospitality firms, churches, schools and others to encourage them to display QR codes via posters at the entrance of premises – as most of you will have seen at businesses as you were out and about at the weekend – so that everyone can maintain their diaries via the NZ Covid Tracer App.Manual sign-in is no longer required, but we do ask that you put up a QR code poster at the door of your premises so people can scan in and can keep a record for themselves. Ongoing improvements will be made to ensure these QR posters are as accessible as possible for businesses.We have also worked with the events sector on a voluntary code to ensure attendees’ details are captured at these bigger events where we know the virus can spread easily.The reason for all of this is simple. If we get one or two cases in future, which will remain possible for some time to come due to the global situation and nature of the virus, we need to shut down those cases fast.The last thing we want to do is move back up the alert system again. So this is a key new behaviour we are asking all New Zealanders to adopt at Level 1. You can do and go wherever you like, we just ask you keep a record of where you have been by scanning in – or noting down your movements for yourself.I have one more thing to ask. At Level 2, agencies have been managing the return of employees to work with around 50 per cent of people back at their places of work last week.Now, at Level 1, you can, unless you feel unwell, go back to your place of work.There has been some good adaptation over the past couple of months with flexible working. This is progress and has helped people with care arrangements and has also helped to avoid traffic congestion – these things we should not lose. But we can balance that with ensuring we also have thriving CBDs.For our part we have asked the State Services Commission to issue new workplace guidance to make it clear that every public sector worker should return to their usual place of work, taking into account flexible work policies. We’ve got to Level 1, now let’s make our next goal supporting our recovery, right across the economy.I know that having such a firm sight on success for so long has sometimes made the road we’ve taken seem longer and the steps we’ve taken seem more laboured.At every step there have been those who’ve pushed us to do something different, to go faster or further, but our collective results speak I think for themselves.That caution and hard work got us down the mountain safely when the descent is always the most perilous part. Moving to Level 1 now the dividend for everyone’s hard work, for now.But we need our team of 5 million for the phase.And that is to get New Zealand moving again, as we move from the collective call to action of Unite against Covid-19 to Unite for Recovery. I encourage you to buy, play and experience New Zealand-made to get our country moving again. Consider it an extra form of support, to visit our country, buy our local products and support our local businesses. For my part, this week is about the Government’s recovery efforts, and focus on jobs.And you’ll be seeing that in my agenda.Tomorrow I will be in the Bay of Plenty, visiting a kiwifruit and avocado packhouse – to discuss how we can further assist the sector to attract workers, noting horticulture has already picked up some 2000 workers who have lost their jobs due to Covid. I will also check in with our Mana in Mahi scheme that gives employers the equivalent of the unemployment benefit to hire those who might be reliant on it, at an electrical business installing solar power and heat pumps in Tauranga.On Wednesday I’ll be in Kaikoura for a tourism announcement.On Thursday I’m in Auckland making a health infrastructure announcement and on Friday, following our $30 billion investment to protect jobs and restart the economy due to Covid, I will speak to the Vision Week web summit where I will share further details of how the Government is working with business on New Zealand’s economic recovery and rebuild from Covid-19. While we’re in a safer, stronger position there’s still no easy path back to pre-Covid life but the determination and focus we have had on our health response will now be vested in our economic rebuild.And so while the job is not done, there is no denying this is a milestone. So can I finish with a very simple thank you New Zealand."
2020-05-14T03:16:36Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Grant Robertson                    ,  Finance Minister's Budget 2020 speech,"Mr Speaker, I move that the Appropriation (2020/21 Estimates) Bill be now read a second time.From its very beginning this Coalition Government has committed to putting the wellbeing of current and future generations of New Zealanders at the heart of everything we do. There is no time in New Zealand’s recent history where this is more important than today. Budget 2020 is being delivered in the shadow of a 1 in 100 year threat to the wellbeing of our people, our communities and our economy. The global COVID-19 pandemic has sent shockwaves around the entire world and we are feeling these effects deeply here at home.The 17th of March now seems an age ago, when I announced in this House a $12.1 billion Covid-19 recovery package. At the time this was one of the largest responses on the planet – some 4% of GDP.   I said then it was only the beginning of our response, and today we take further steps in enabling New Zealanders, together, to respond, recover and rebuild. These are not the words I thought would use to describe this Budget only a couple of months ago. There are many words and concepts that New Zealanders would have been surprised to hear themselves using in quite the way we are.  Bubble, physical distancing, PPE, contact tracing, “you’re on mute”,   Level 4, Level 3, and yes, as of today,  Level 2.Another word is “unprecedented’. It is one we have heard and said almost daily. The lives of all New Zealanders have been affected to an extent none of us would have thought possible only a matter of months ago.  It is also a word we have to keep using.  This pandemic has not finished, its health and economic stories are still being told. We can be very proud as a country of our health response, and it must go on.  And now, we also have to put a team of five million to work on our economic response.The initiatives we’ve put in place since March 17, just two months ago, have formed the first stage of our plan to face COVID-19. Respond – go hard, go early.We were faced with a choice between a public health catastrophe as has been seen in other countries, or unprecedented and difficult measures. There were no costless decisions in this situation, nor was there any playbook to go by.I know that our success in controlling the virus has come at a price, with hundreds of thousands of Kiwi workers and employers having to stay home, and jobs and businesses lost. But I stand by our view that the best economic response is a health response. By going hard and early – getting on top of the virus, while protecting jobs and businesses – we now have a head start on many countries around the world to get the economy moving again.Mr Speaker,I want to thank our coalition partner New Zealand First, and our confidence and supply partner the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand. This has been a Budget put together in extraordinary circumstances and your cooperation, commitment and flexibility has been much appreciated.I also want to place on record my appreciation for the massive effort of hundreds of public servants over the last two months, including in the preparation of this Budget.  Many people, including those at the Treasury and in our Ministerial offices have worked seven days a week for this whole period of time.  Their dedication is a measure of true public service.The core of Budget 2020 will boost critical public services, fund infrastructure, and provide the unprecedented investment needed for the second and third stages of our plan to face COVID-19: Recover and Rebuild.Through this Budget we are establishing the $50 billion Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund. This fund builds on top of the initial $12.1 billion package, and the $12 billion New Zealand Upgrade Programme we announced in January.This is the most significant financial commitment by a New Zealand government in modern history. The fund does not represent a target for spending, but gives us the flexibility to be able to respond as necessary.The Fund will be critical in seeing New Zealand through the economic struggle that is coming, and rebuilding our economy for the better over the long-term.Our recovery and rebuild will be based on getting New Zealanders back to work.  This Budget is about jobs.  Keeping people in their jobs wherever we can, supporting businesses and sectors to create new jobs through infrastructure, housing and more, directly creating jobs that help restore our environment and conservation estate, and training and re-training people for new jobs at a scale we have never seen before.  It also begins to rebuild our social infrastructure – acknowledging the toll this crisis has taken on our communities, and on the people and places that hold them together.It is a once in a generation Budget. It is bold because the task we face is monumental. We said at the outset of this crisis that while we would not be able to save every job or every business, we would do everything in our power to protect our people and our economy. Today we go further, and begin to chart a course to a better tomorrow.Economic and Fiscal Outlook Mr Speaker,Coming into this crisis New Zealand was fortunate to have a fundamentally strong economy and fiscal position.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic real GDP growth in the year to December 2019 was higher than many of our international peers. Unemployment at 4% was historically low and wage growth of above 3% was at decade long highs.New Zealand’s fiscal position was also strong. The Coalition Government had delivered on its plan to reduce net core Crown debt below 20 per cent of GDP and achieved $12.8 billion of OBEGAL surpluses in our first two years in office.These were conscious choices that did not go unchallenged. But this strong fiscal position, built on the work of Bill English and Michael Cullen, now means we are much better placed than many other countries to use our balance sheet to cushion the blow of COVID-19 on the economy and to protect the wellbeing of New Zealanders.  The rainy day has arrived, but we are well prepared.Many other countries are not starting from the same position of strength that we are. The UK started with net debt above 75%, the USA 90%, and Ireland 40%. Many countries are already well over 100% as they respond to the virus.The IMF expects a decline in global economic activity not seen in peacetime since the Great Depression of the 1930s, with annual global growth expected to fall to -3.0 per cent in 2020.Although we are doing everything in our power to push back on these trends, there is no sugar coating the impact this crisis has had on the government’s books.  Treasury’s forecasts and alternative scenarios indicate there will be a sharp fall in economic activity and a substantial rise in unemployment.New Zealand’s real GDP growth rate is forecast to decline from 2.8 per cent in the year ending June 2019 to -4.6%  in the year ending June 2020, driven by a quarterly decline in GDP of over 20 per cent in the June 2020 quarter. Annual average GDP growth is forecast to return to positive from the year ending September 2021 onwards.Unemployment is forecast to increase significantly, rising to 8.3% in the year ending June 2020, before peaking at 9.8% in September 2020 and then recovering thereafter.It is worthy of note that economic forecasting is more of an art than a science at the best of times, but more so than ever now.  The full impact of COVID-19 around the world is still being seen. The depth and duration of the pandemic means that the economic outlook is highly uncertain and forecasts will change as more information comes to light. But what they do clearly show is the scale of the economic challenge that lies ahead.Mr Speaker,I remain committed to managing our books carefully and responsibly. And right now, being responsible means investing to support our people, businesses and communities to get through this and to rebuild. This is the rainy day we have been preparing for – now we must weather the global storm.The scale of this required investment will impact the operating position and net debt.OBEGAL deficits will average 9.3% of GDP between 2020 and 2022. Careful economic management will see the deficit reduce to 1.3% of GDP by 2024.Net core Crown debt is forecast to be 30.2% at the end of this financial year, and to reach 53.6% of GDP by the 2023 fiscal year before stabilising.  These are numbers far in excess of the range that we had been working to, and the levels we had achieved.But this is a one in one hundred year event affecting every country in the world this way.  In an international context our debt will still be among the lowest in the world among developed countries.  Our disciplined and balanced approach to managing the economy means that ratings agencies around the world have in recent weeks re-affirmed our credit rating and their view that New Zealand is well placed to get through COVID-19.Running operating deficits and allowing net core Crown debt to increase in the short term is necessary. This level of investment in the short term will support the economy recovering to where we can return to a more sustainable fiscal position.Child Poverty ReportMr Speaker,This Budget includes the second ever Budget Day report on child poverty. Our goal remains, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, for New Zealand to be the best place in the world to be a child.Budget 2020 builds on our past investments to reduce child poverty, including through the Families Package, the indexation of benefits to wages, and lifts to the minimum wage. It is also supported by our actions on March 17th to lift main benefits by $25 per week and other policies that are supporting the lowest income New Zealanders.In February this year the Government Statistician published the first report of progress against the child poverty targets set under the Act. Reporting timeframes meant that the impact of the Government’s Families Package was only partially shown, but of the nine different poverty measures reported, seven showed decreases from the previous year’s baseline rates.The Report also indicates that the Government was broadly on track to meet the three-year targets on the two primary measures of low income.It is still too early to know what the precise impact of COVID-19 will be on rates of child poverty. The loss of jobs and incomes will have knock-on impacts for households trying to pay their rents and meet every day needs.Fundamentally, what we do know is that investing in our children and their wellbeing will have significant long-term benefits for our economy and broader society, long after COVID-19 has passed.  This focus remains core to the government’s agenda.COVID-19 Respond, Recover and RebuildMr Speaker,As we move into Alert Level 2 and the Recovery stage, our purpose is to see people back at work, to clear the pathway back for communities and sectors most affected by COVID-19, and to lay the groundwork for our rebuild.The COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, established through this Budget, will be used to support New Zealanders through each stage of the impact of the virus.  It is designed to not only support the immediate response but also provide support, as necessary, over the longer term to rebuild our economy and society.We have already committed $13.9 billion of the Fund to previously announced initiatives, including funding for the Wage Subsidy Scheme, the essential workers leave scheme, SME support measures, the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme, and additional packages to support the health response, and resources for those in need.Today we are announcing a further $15.9 billion in funding focused on key areas that will kick-start the economic recovery, create decent, sustainable jobs, ensure the security of our most vulnerable, and lay the groundwork for us to rebuild a better nation together.Business supportMr Speaker,The Government has already provided unprecedented support to cushion the blow of COVID-19 for businesses across New Zealand. As well as the Wage Subsidy Scheme, businesses have been supported through significant changes in the taxation system, low and interest free loans, together with supportive changes to laws and regulations. This Budget goes further, with a $4 billion Business Support package to help keep people in work and position businesses for recovery and growth.For many businesses the struggle in the face of COVID-19 is not over.  We know that a number of them are far from trading at normal levels, particularly in the tourism, hospitality and retail sectors.Today we are announcing a targeted extension of the successful Wage Subsidy Scheme. The Scheme has already seen more than $10.7 billion paid out to support workers and businesses.The extension will focus on businesses who are still doing it tough.  It will be available for a further eight week period for those who have suffered a 50% reduction in turnover over the 30 days prior to application compared to last year. It will follow on directly from the end of the first twelve week scheme. It is estimated to cost up to $3.2 billion.This extension will  provide  further  stimulus  to  the  economy,  keep  people  in  work  and  give  businesses more time as we move through Alert Level 2 to re-establish or re-orientate their operations.Beyond the Wage Subsidy, our direct Business Support package includes increasing support to research and development. We are launching a $150 million short-term temporary loan scheme to incentivise businesses to continue R&D programmes that may be at risk due to COVID-19. The loans will provide one-off finance and will be administered by Callaghan Innovation.Trade will also play a significant role in kickstarting New Zealand’s recovery from COVID-19.  We are providing a $216 million boost to New Zealand Trade and Enterprise to expand the scope and intensity of support provided to exporting firms. This includes increasing activity for New Zealand firms in priority markets and expanding the digital services available for firms.COVID-19 has brought home the increasing importance of e-commerce for our small businesses. We are setting aside $10 million in funding to support small businesses to improve their e-commerce service offerings, and incentives/grants to encourage e-commerce adoption.  We will also provide further support for business advice, the e-invoicing project, Business Connect and the Better For Business programme.InfrastructureMr Speaker,Investment in new infrastructure projects will help support the longer-term economic recovery from COVID-19.  It will not only grow jobs, but it will also seek to address the infrastructure deficit that has held back New Zealand’s productivity for too long. We will build the infrastructure we need to unclog our cities, to connect our towns, and to support sustainable development. We will make sure that this is the infrastructure needed for a 21st century New Zealand that, among other things, supports meeting our climate change goals.We had already made a significant start on this with our $12 billion New Zealand Upgrade Programme announced in January.In this Budget we are establishing an initial $3 billion contingency for additional infrastructure investment. Cabinet will make the final decisions on which projects should be funded from this contingency in the coming weeks and months.This will include projects that are identified through the Infrastructure Reference Group as well as bids received from individual departments and agencies.  We will have a particular focus on regional infrastructure projects identified through the Provincial Growth Fund, and on projects that advance other goals of the government.  We look forward to increased partnerships with local government and the private sector to advance this programme of work.I fully expect that we will fund further infrastructure projects beyond this initial allocation as we move on with our rebuild, including in areas such as our Three Waters Programme.The policies we have introduced as part of the COVID-19 response, such as reform of the Resource Management Act, will be a significant support in in this regard.HousingEvery New Zealander deserves a warm, dry home. But a decade of underinvestment has resulted in New Zealanders having to put up with a housing shortage, and too many of those homes that are available are of poor quality. We’ve seen this manifest in unaffordable house prices, high rents and homelessness that no New Zealander of any political persuasion can be comfortable with.Not only is Housing one of our greatest areas of need it is also a job rich area.  We have already seen through our Construction Accord the possibilities that exist to train and build a workforce to drive forward our goals on Housing.Today’s Housing package creates 8,000 additional public or transitional housing places over the next 4 to 5 years.  This will be financed by $5 billion of building through the Kāinga Ora borrowing programme and investment in Community and Transitional Housing providers. We are also providing $670 million of support and services to tenants. This will improve affordability by increasing the supply of houses, while also providing a shot in the arm to the residential construction sector as we emerge from the crisis. It will also take us further down the path of ending homelessness.Further support for housing development and construction, including in the private residential market will be a critical element of our recovery from COVID-19, and it is my intention that this will be the subject of further investment in the next phases of the fund.Environment Jobs PackageMr Speaker,Our rebuild from COVID-19 provides an opportunity to address some of the long-standing sustainability and environmental challenges facing New Zealand. Our $1 billion Environmental Jobs package announced today will create thousands of jobs that will at the same time support habitat protection, pest control and biodiversity on our public lands.This includes a $433 million investment in regional environmental projects. These will support our economic and environmental recovery in partnership with local government and farmers.  It will include restoring wetlands, stabilising river banks and removing sediment. There will be projects and jobs created across New Zealand, including in the Kaipara catchment.  A $315 million package of pest eradication and pest control work, including advancing Predator Free New Zealand is established in this Budget.  This also includes work to get under control populations of wallabies and to help control wilding pines.We are also establishing a $200 million Jobs for Nature Fund to support job creation within the DOC estate, including through upgrading tracks, huts and other facilities.These are practical initiatives. Creating jobs, while protecting and enhancing our environment – a perfect ingredient for recovery from COVID-19.Education, Training and JobsMr Speaker,As New Zealanders find themselves out of work, or entering the labour market for the first time it is vital that there is strong support for them to get the skills and knowledge they need for work. For businesses they also need support to keep and take on apprentices.In the past investment has not been made up front, seeing people drop out of the labour market, so that when the time has come and businesses have recovered there is not the workforce available with the required skills.We will not let that happen again.  The Budget is funding $1.6 billion in a Trades and Apprentices Package to provide opportunities for New Zealanders of all ages to receive trades training. This will include financial support for businesses to retain their apprentices, free apprenticeships and training in targeted critical industries, and funding increased enrolments in tertiary education and training.  There is a specific $50 million fund for Maori Apprentices and Trades Training.We recognise the importance of the partnership with businesses and workers in making our training system work. The package also includes the establishment funding for Workforce Development Councils and Regional Skills Leadership groups to assist with coordination. The Ministry of Social Development is being supported to expand its employment services and core provision as well.We are also injecting a further $121 million into He Poutama Rangatahi. This scheme provides funding to community driven programmes to resolve barriers to employment and training.  They have a proven track record in engaging young people who are at risk of falling out of work and developing them as people as well.This boost will accelerate its establishment into urban areas  that  have  the  greatest  numbers  of  young  people  not  in  employment,  education  or  training such  as  West  and  South  Auckland,  Hamilton,  Porirua and  Christchurch East.Mr SpeakerIf there was one decision in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis that symbolised the failure to understand the role of education and training in the recovery from a downturn, it was the decision to cancel funding for adult and community education, including night classes.  This government will not allow that mistake to be made again.  The Budget includes a $16 million boost to Adult and Community Education to restore that funding and help providers to meet the increased needs for training and upskilling in the wake of COVID-19.This government is absolutely committed to the place and role of education in supporting our recovery and rebuild.  We also understand that the COVID-19 crisis has put pressure on students, many of whom have lost income as a result of losing part time work.  We are establishing a $20 million hardship fund in this Budget, and in further responses we will continue to work on other ways we can support students through this difficult time.Sector recoveryMr Speaker,Over and above the wider support we are providing to businesses to keep people employed and support the growth of new jobs, we have a range of targeted support packages aimed at sectors particularly impacted by COVID-19.One of the Industries most directly impacted by COVID-19 has been tourism. The shutting down of our borders has been a critical element in our success in controlling COVID-19.  But quite clearly that has turned off the tap of the millions of visitors who have supported our tourism industry. Border restrictions are going to be with us for some time, so we need to work with the businesses and tourism centres to re-imagine and transition the industry. The extension to the wage subsidy scheme announced today will provide further support for tourism businesses and jobs as domestic tourism begins again.The Budget today makes the first contribution from the government to the Tourism Sector Recovery Plan.  This $400 million funding injection will support the first stages of an action plan agreed with the industry. This will include a transitions programme to support businesses to plan for the next steps, a fund to ensure key tourism assets survive, a domestic tourism marketing campaign and a public/private taskforce to shape the future of the industry.This Budget also recognises the significant impact of COVID-19 on our Māori community, particularly in terms of employment where Maori are already over-represented.Our Māori COVID-19 Recovery Package totals $485 million and includes a range of measures to support Whānau through the recovery period. This is in addition to other significant investment in Budget 2020 for Maori initiatives.This package includes a $137 million boost to Whānau Ora to ensure providers can continue to provide timely and flexible support to whānau facing the health and socio-economic impacts of COVID-19.  I want to make a special acknowledgement to those providers and iwi groups who have provided hundreds of thousands of care packages to the whanau during this period.  Nga mihi ki te aroha.The package also establishes funding for a Maori and Iwi Housing and Innovation Fund (Te Maihi O Te Whare Maori) to create opportunities for building housing for whanau and the jobs that go with it.  More than $20 million has been allocated to a cadetship programme to support re-skilling and career development opportunities.Further initiatives to support Maori education are supported in order to ensure the effects of COVID-19 do not take away from the earlier investments made by the government. This includes programmes to sustain Kohanga Reo and revitalising Te Reo Maori.Likewise, our $195 million Pacific recovery package is comprised of a range of initiatives to support Pacific communities who have been affected by COVID-19, including a major focus on programmes to lift skills and support employment.   One example is the extension of the Tupu Aotearoa programme across New Zealand. This helps Pacific young people to find employment, complete further training or undertake study. The package also includes a Pasifika Culture and Heritage Fund, support for housing, business and community development, education and training.There are also sector recovery packages for the Arts and Sports.  These are both areas that have been devastated by COVID-19.  Funding sources have dried up and events have been cancelled.  They are also both sectors that have increasingly offered employment opportunities and contributed to our economy.   We know that they are very much part our social infrastructure.  They make our communities strong.   The details of these packages will be announced in the coming days. One very particular part of the community and sporting sector gets a long sought after boost in this Budget.  Our Water Safety sector has long relied on donations for much of its work.  In an increasingly tough environment to raise that money the likes of Surf Livesaving New Zealand and the Coastguard will now have funding security with $62 million allocated over four years for their critical work in our community.Further sector packages, including for the media sector are being developed over the coming months.Community WellbeingMr Speaker,It is critical that we support our communities, and especially vulnerable people, to respond to and recover from COVID-19. On March 17th we provided a $2.8 billion package that increased main benefits across the board by $25 per week and doubled the Winter Energy Payment for 2020. We have continued to provide emergency support via Civil Defence throughout the period, and provided $100 million of support to house the homeless. In this Budget we are investing in financial assistance for caregivers. This will increase the current rates of the Foster Care Allowance, Orphan’s Benefit and  Unsupported  Child’s  Benefit  by  $25  per  week  per  child  to  meet  the  needs of children and their caregivers. It also provides further support that the Minister for Children will outline in the coming days.Food security will be critical throughout the recovery period, with too many individuals and families impacted by COVID-19 struggling to afford food. No New Zealander should go hungry because they can’t afford it.That’s why we are expanding the Free and Healthy School Lunch programme to 200,000 students from Term 4. The $217 million expansion will target students in schools with the highest disadvantage and is expected to create 2,400 jobs in the community.We are also providing $32 million to increase support for foodbanks, food rescue and other community food services to leverage surplus donated food from producers, manufacturers and suppliers that would otherwise go to landfill.We are also establishing a $36 million fund to support community groups to respond directly to COVID-19 and its impacts, with a particular focus on those who are from Maori, Pacific, refugee and migrant communities.Mr Speaker, as I have said today’s announcements are part of a rolling maul of Government support throughout the COVID-19 response and recovery.  Our economic response to COVID-19 will happen every day, not just Budget Day. We will continue to work with New Zealanders to shape that response.Budget 2020 Core Services PackageMr Speaker,As we faced up to COVID-19, and deployed such significant support in such a short space of time, we had to take another look at our plans as a Government.As in businesses all around New Zealand, important work has had to be slowed or postponed, and resources have had to be reprioritised in light of the fight against COVID-19.The Budget is no exception. The new spending packages planned on our five priorities that were announced in the Budget Policy Statement have been re-assessed.We may revisit them in future, but the focus for Budget 2020 has now very quickly become providing the strong public services we need and taking our next steps to recover and rebuild.New Zealand’s ability to respond rapidly and effectively to this crisis has highlighted the importance of investing in and maintaining effective core government services.  I will briefly run through the main elements of the core package to maintain and enhance these services.HealthInvestment in the health sector has never been more critical. Budget 2020 invests extensively in areas that we know will make a difference to the wellbeing of New Zealanders.The total investment made through our core health package is $5.6 billion in services and $755 million in capital investment.This spend includes $3.9 billion for DHBs. This represents the largest ever annual investment. This will provide much needed funding for our hospitals and other services so that they can continue to provide for New Zealand’s growing and changing population.This Budget also provides funding for more medicines through a $160 million increase to the Combined Pharmaceutical Budget managed by PHARMAC. This critical investment takes PHARMAC’s medicines budget to a record $1.045 billion for 2020/21. That’s an increase of 20% since 2017/18.We are also helping disabled New Zealanders to live good lives, with a further $832.5 million for Disability Support Services. This initiative provides security of funding for services to people with long-term physical, intellectual and/or sensory impairment.In addition to this package, and the $500 million allocated as our initial boost to deal with COVID-19, we are announcing today further support to parts of the sector particularly affected, including $37 million to sustain laboratory testing capacity and additional support for ambulance, aged care, disability, and hospice services.  I expect that we will provide further support to our health sector in the coming months.Social sectorBudget 2020 provides a funding boost to both governmental and non-governmental social services, to support New Zealanders’ employment, housing, and wellbeing.Our $203 million Family Violence Services package represents the largest funding boost for family violence service providers in over a decade, so that they can recruit and develop highly capable staff and respond to the demand they are facing. It builds on the $320 million in funding provided through Budget 19, to be the two largest increases in family violence prevention funding on record.Education Mr Speaker,This Budget invests nearly $1 billion to support the core provision of education services. This will provide substantial support to students across all levels of education, while also targeting investment in areas that we know will benefit students who need it the most.The Education package makes a significant investment in our early childhood sector.  The sector has been placed under particular strain in recent years, and this has been exacerbated by COVID-19.   The Budget includes cost adjustments for ECE subsidies and a pay boost for early childhood teachers. The government will make further announcements on support this sector in the near future.The School Property Investment package will invest $115.1 million to help expand, maintain, and enhance our schools.Primary IndustriesNew Zealand’s primary industries play a critical role in growing our economy. As we move further into the post-Covid-19 economic recovery, our primary sector is more important than ever. The core package invests nearly $500 million in initiatives that will ensure our primary industries are supported and sustainable now, and into the future.Funding in the package will support our primary industries with their existing operations and preventing or mitigating the impacts of biosecurity threats and enabling implementation of climate change and ETS reforms.Justice sectorBudget 2020 provides a boost in investment to support a safe and equitable justice sector. We are increasing community safety through investment in new technology, court buildings and corrections.A key initiative in this package is the Next Generation Critical Communications programme which will invest in bringing state of the art communications capabilities to Police, Fire, and Ambulance, supporting healthier, safer, and more connected communities.  This will see our emergency services finally able to communicate with the public and with one another all over New Zealand in a safe and reliable manner.The package also provides funding to enable continued access to justice services, such as funding for legal aid, community law centres, and the Canterbury Earthquakes Insurance Tribunal. Additionally, it provides funding for the newly established Criminal Cases Review Commission.Arts and CultureBudget 2020 re-affirms this Government’s commitment to supporting arts and culture in New Zealand, ensuring that funding is available to preserve our nation’s taonga, promote creativity, and celebrate our diversity and history.The package provides support for the local film industry and culturally significant historical collections, as well as ensuring the accessibility of public media platforms to diverse audiences, such as New Zealanders with hearing impairments and those from our Pacific communities.  It includes the significant Preserving the Nations Memory Project that will build new facilities for our public records.Defence and Foreign AffairsThe Budget 2020 package includes funding for critical pressures in the defence sector. This funding investment in areas such as ICT and Defence estate infrastructure and the replacement of the Defence Force’s C-130H Hercules fleet. The package also includes an additional $55.6 million for New Zealand to provide further Official Development Assistance particularly to our Pacific neighbours during a time of great need. It will bring New Zealand’s overall ODA spending to almost 0.3% of forecasted Gross National Income for the first time in forty years.Transport Budget 2020 builds on investment made through the New Zealand Upgrade Programme and includes more than $1 billion to improve transport across the country. This investment will enhance the resilience and reliability of national rail and ferry networks and, over time, contribute to efforts to reduce our carbon footprint through decreasing emissions.I particularly want to highlight in this package the $400 million capital investment to help replace the Interislander ferries. New ferries will provide a more secure and resilient link between the North and South Islands.The significant investments we are making in public services will be of the utmost importance with the country now moving out of the initial response stage and into the recovery stage. These investments complement and support our targeted COVID-19 response, recovery and rebuilding measures.Mr Speaker,Today’s Budget represents the next steps in our recovery and rebuild.  The world is still learning what the impacts of COVID-19 will be.  We owe it to New Zealanders to work carefully through our next steps, recognising that the decisions we are making will define the lives and livelihoods of many people for years to come.The weight of those decisions comes with a spirit of optimism in what New Zealand can be.  The glimmer of silver lining on this darkest of clouds comes from the knowledge that we have the opportunity to build back better.  There are few times in your life when you get to hit the reset button.  It is a privilege that many countries do not have right now as they still struggle to get the virus under control.  It is an opportunity we will not squander.Our rebuild must be one that takes the very best of who we are, and uses it to take on the issues and challenges in front of us.  Some of them are old – inequality, low productivity, polluted rivers, some are newer, the transition to a low carbon economy, adjusting to the rapidly changing world of work, maintaining social cohesion.All of them are in front of us in stark relief.   We can draw on the lessons of the past as to how to deal with them.  The answers lie in the great traditions of the First Labour Government who rebuilt New Zealand after the Great Depression.  It was a time when they understood a genuine partnership between government and the people.  That each and every person in this country deserved the right to take up the chances afforded by being lucky enough to live in, as my predecessor Peter Fraser called it, this green and pleasant land.  They built houses, rail and roads, they created the welfare state and a strong public health system, and they backed shopkeepers and manufacturers.  We are taking those principles into the modern era.We can also draw the lessons of the past as to what not to do in response to a major economic shock.   In this case Mr Speaker I can draw on the experiences of my own life.  As the economic carnage of the 1980s and 1990s wreaked havoc in our communities, I saw that up close.  It was based on a tired set of ideas that the market would save us, that if government sat on the sidelines all would be well.  Well, it didn’t work out that way and lives and livelihoods were lost.That will not happen again, not on the watch of this government.  We know that we must work in partnership with iwi, business, unions, community groups, every one of the team of five million to make sure we all not only get through this, but that we thrive on the other side.That means continuing to be bold as we have been in the last two months.  We are not always all going to agree on the path, but it must be one that gives each and every New Zealander a stake in our future.  Decent, well paid work that provides respect and dignity. Looking after our most vulnerable.  Where we make good on our promise to future generations that we will take on climate change and leave them a legacy to build from. This Budget takes the responsible path of investing to respond, recover and rebuild.  It takes us down a path where we will face choices as to how we begin to repay some of our debt.There will be difficult choices then, as they are difficult choices today.  But I promise you this Mr Speaker, this government will never put the burden of those choices on those who can least afford it. We will not cut the services that are their lifelines.  We will not preach austerity, but line our pockets with tax cuts.No Mr Speaker, we will rebuild this country with hard work, innovation, creativity, compassion and courage.  We will grow our economy sustainably to pay back our debt, we will fairly share that burden, and above all we will do it together.There are still tough times ahead.  But we have made it this far in fighting COVID-19 by drawing on every bit of who we are as New Zealanders.Kind, but tough, fair but forthright, single minded, but united in action.It is just the end of the beginning, the next chapters are ours to write.Kia maia, kia atawhai, kia kaha.Be bold, be kind, be strong.He waka eke noa, we are all in this together."
2020-05-14T03:09:17Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  ​​​​​​​Prime Minister’s Budget 2020 speech,"Mr Speaker, business as usual in this place would dictate that today, Budget day, is the day that the Minister of Finance comes down to this house and delivers the Government’s plan for the year ahead. Business as usual, would then have the Opposition stand and give a speech opposing that Budget.Business as usual would have everyone in this house retrench into our old patterns that the public know so well but, if we’re honest, have probably never had much time for.Today Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has acted as if it’s business as usual. But nothing, and I mean nothing, about this time in our history is usual and so neither should our response be.We have been a Government that, with the support and efforts of New Zealanders, took us through an enormous health challenge. And we will take the same approach to the recovery of our economy.  I make the offer to Mr Bridges and the Opposition today, to see this period in our history for what it is – a global crisis. And to see this Budget for what it is, a response to the rainy day we have planned for. Now is the chance for us to come together as politicians. To say that a rainy day demands of us that we shelter and protect New Zealand to weather the storm. Rather than argue about who gets to hold the umbrella, I hope the Opposition steps away from business as usual, and votes for this Budget and the jobs it will create.Mr Speaker, a mere six months ago nobody would have imagined a world in the grip of a global COVID-19 pandemic, let alone one that would wreak havoc across health systems and economies globally. I still vividly remember at the beginning of the year reading about the first lockdowns overseas and thinking what a remarkable thing it was. To ask humans to stay in one place for such a long period of time seemed unfathomable. And yet here we are, having shut our borders, moved into lockdown, and collectively built a wall of defence to a virus that was closing in on the world. Mr Speaker, there are few things that I think I will ever consider as being outside the bounds of possibility any more. And perhaps that is the same perspective we now need as we start our recovery. We have to be focused. We have to be decisive. We have to go into this period knowing it will be tough, but that there is hope and possibility.  In short, I give my commitment to New Zealanders that they will see us apply the same unrelenting focus we have had on our health response to COVID-19, to our economic response.And that work has already started. From the very beginning we have said that jobs were our focus, and they are. That is why in March we announced a wage subsidy scheme designed to keep people connected to work, and to the certainty and dignity that can come with work.  That programme has supported roughly 1.6 million New Zealanders to date and has meant we have avoided the spike in unemployment other countries have experienced while our country was in lockdown and businesses were unable to open. It helped get many, many workers and businesses through the toughest weeks so that they now have the chance to reopen and move to recovery. But we must keep going. The times ahead will be tough. Global predictions are dire. Unemployment will rise, and growth will slow dramatically. We know as a trading nation that will have an impact, and it will be significant and it will be painful. We have never sugar-coated what the future will look like, but nor will we pretend there is nothing that we can do about it. Governments have choices, just as we did when we faced COVID-19. And those choices are between sit back and hope, or sit up and act. We have chosen to act. Today, we are starting by extending the wage subsidy. It won’t be exactly the same as the first round, as we look to make it more targeted. We know there are businesses who are opening up again, but we also know there are some who cannot just yet, while others will take more time to recover. It serves no one, if in the meantime while businesses are opening back up, to lay off staff unnecessarily. I know how important this is, I have received a huge number of emails from people describing what a difference the wage subsidy has meant to them. In almost all of them they talk about their staff being their family, and how important retaining and looking after them has been. So today we are extending the wage subsidy for another eight weeks with a focus on providing support to businesses who have been particularly affected by Covid. This will mean employers in sectors like tourism and other small businesses across the country will be supported, and it will ease the recovery for thousands.And like the first round of the wage subsidy saved jobs, this targeted extension will save jobs too. That’s why it is such an important part this jobs budget – we believe it’s the best thing we can do at this phase of our recovery to help businesses who are getting back on their feet to keep on their staff.  But our response must go beyond supporting those still in work. That isn’t enough. Too many people have already lost their jobs and we need to support their path back to employment.For them, we must be swift. We must be practical. But we also owe it to ourselves to take this opportunity to solve the problems of both today and yesterday as we go. If I had asked you before COVID, what it is that we must address as a nation, what our common challenges were, I would imagine that many people would write a similar list. We have long faced a housing crisis, our environment has been suffering, inequality and child poverty have all been issues we’ve had to tackle.In three years’ time I want to look back and say that COVID was not the point those issues got worse, but the chance we had to make them better.  We can emerge from this crisis stronger than we were before. That’s why we are focussed on jobs, but also jobs that solve these entrenched problems.So let’s look at how. We have had a skills deficit, and now on top of that we have more people who need the chance to train or retrain. That’s why this Budget will target the vocational training and apprenticeships we need most, and make them free. And I don’t just mean for school leavers, I mean everyone. It will mean more people training in building and construction, in agriculture, in manufacturing, community health, counselling and care work. This will help those who have lost their jobs retrain, and others to train on the job.And while many have lost work, there are others who have labour shortages. Even through COVID-19 people have wanted to buy our high quality food and fibre, and that’s why in this Budget we’ll be looking to partner and support 10,000 New Zealanders into primary sector jobs.For our young people, those who so often carry the brunt of a crisis like this, we will fund 1,000 more places in trades academies, expand He Poutama Rangatahi to support young people into work in West and South Auckland, Hamilton, Porirua and East Christchurch, and build group training schemes that support Maori apprenticeships. All in all Mr Speaker, this is a $1.6 billion investment into New Zealand’s future, and into rebuilding apprenticeships, into closing our skills gap. And that will be so important because of our next challenge. Housing. Our response to COVID on the face of it, had a very simple premise early on – stay home, save lives. That simple, simple requirement forced us all as a country to ask the question – what if you don’t have a home?The answer was simple, we will find you one. And through hard work and huge collaboration, between Government, local government, iwi and the community sector, that is exactly what happened. In the midst of the crisis we housed the chronically homeless in New Zealand.Now we need to keep it that way. In this Budget we are announcing an extra 8000 houses, providing $5 billion of construction stimulus into the economy over the next 4 to 5 years. This will be split between public and transitional housing and, when combined with what we have already funded, takes the number of housing places to 17,000. This represents the largest public housing building programme in recent decades, and I hope means that COVID 19 will be remembered as a period where New Zealand didn’t just stay home, it made sure everyone had a home. Since coming into Government we have seen countless other examples of the under investment in New Zealand’s infrastructure. We have already invested $12 billion in the NZ Upgrade Programme, and our $3 billion fund in this Budget will be squarely focused on projects that are ready to create jobs, but also tackle issues like water infrastructure. But perhaps there is no better example of the way this Budget can bring together the challenges of today, and the challenges of yesterday, than the jobs it will create in regional New Zealand to restore our environment.  Whether it’s working with iwi on pest control to prevent the loss of North Island Forests, working with farmers to tackle wallaby, fence waterways or stabilise riverbanks – or working with council, local businesses and DOC to employ thousands of people to restore wetlands, boost predator controls, improve tracks and huts –  this is a win, win. Wilding pine controls alone require on foot labour, chain saw operators, heavy machinery and helicopters. It has a knock on effect to accommodation, vehicles, and repairs maintenance and food providers. In total this Budget creates almost 11,000 jobs for our environment, for our regions, for our people. And that brings me to the last challenge, child poverty. We know this has the potential to get even worse than where we are now. And while we moved quickly even before lockdown, providing increasing Government support to those out of work through benefit increases and the winter energy payment, today we focus on kids with a major expansion of the food in schools programme. We started this programme last year, now we expand healthy lunches in schools so that around 200,000 more children across the country benefit. Based on what we know, this will also create an estimated 2,000 jobs in local communities. And equally important it will mean in the tough days ahead we can guarantee our most vulnerable kids will get a filling, healthy lunch every school day. Mr Speaker, I want to finish where I started. On our businesses, on our job creators, on our innovators and on those who have carried such a huge burden over these last weeks and months. We know they have faced challenges too, that pre date COVID. The cost of innovation, the need to constantly make productivity gains. The challenge of growing beyond New Zealand, if you choose to make that leap. That’s why the Budget provides incentives and grants to encourage e-commerce, train more digital advisors and provide information and support for SMEs wanting to incorporate e-commerce into their businesses. It sees a significant increase in support for entrepreneurs and businesses looking to invest in new products and R&D. This will help create the jobs New Zealand needs. And it puts $216 million into increasing the number of exporters receiving intensive support from New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, and increasing digital services and tools. Mr Speaker, I said yesterday that this Budget would be about jobs, jobs, jobs. In total it seeks to save as many as 140,000 of them over the next two years, and to support the growth of 370,000 more over four years. The Budget sets out a clear plan to generate new green jobs, rural jobs, jobs rebuilding crumbling infrastructure and new training opportunities for those who need it.But even this is just stage one. You have heard today about some of our sector recovery funds. We must keep working alongside those industries who have been most gravely affected. Tourism has a package announced today. In coming days we will do the same for arts, sports and large events. But just as the science informing our health response evolved, so too will the economic situation both global and domestic. It is for this reason that the Finance Minister has announced today the next suite of actions we are putting in place but has also held back funds to tackle the next phase of our rebuild.We know business craves certainty in order to plan how it will operate. And while there is much we cannot predict in these uncertain times, what I can promise is that we know this is not the end of what we need to do. We will keep working with you, we will keep supporting workers and businesses. Mr Speaker, you can see the strength of this Government in this Budget. I want to thank our Coalition partner and the Deputy Prime Minister for their partnership in bringing this Budget today. I’d like to also thank our Confidence and Supply partner the Greens for their consistent advocacy to be bold in tackling the challenges of both today and tomorrow.Finally, I want to thank the Minister of Finance. Grant thank you for your determination and your compassion. Through this crisis you have acted to protect the jobs and livelihoods of millions of New Zealanders. Today you deliver a Budget that will carry us through this crisis and gets the economy moving. So now, we get on with it. We went hard and early to fight COVID-19 and that success has opened up economic opportunities. Now, it’s time to make the most of the head start New Zealand has with its economic recovery.This Budget shows how we are positioning New Zealand for that right now. It shows that we know this is not the time for business as usual, it’s the time for a relentless focus on jobs, on training, on education, and the role they all can play to support our environment, and our people. So Mr Speaker, let’s begin our recovery and let’s rebuild, together."
2020-05-13T01:48:45Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  ​​​​​​​Prime Minister's pre-Budget speech,"Tomorrow afternoon, Budget 2020 will be delivered within the most challenging economic conditions faced by any Government since the Great Depression. The global COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a global economic shock not of our making, but like every country in the world, we are also not immune to its fallout.Let me be clear, the coming months and years will be some of the most challenging our country has faced in a very, very long time. The International Monetary Fund predicts the global economy will contract by 3% in 2020, much worse than during the global financial crisis. Around the world, unemployment will rise, significantly.Businesses will fail and close. Government revenue will decline. And we will feel the pain here too. New Zealand is about to enter a very tough winter.But every winter is followed by spring, and if we make the right choices we can get New Zealanders back to work and our economy moving again quickly.  Today I want to set out the values that underpin our economic response to the virus and signal how we intend to tackle it. First the best economic response to the virus was always a strong health responseGoing hard and early means economic opportunities, and faster than many trading partnersI know the last seven weeks have been a huge challenge to business, which is why the first phase in our economic response has been entirely focused on assisting business to stay afloat and supporting New Zealanders to stay connected to their jobs. I’m enormously proud of the work Finance Minister Grant Robertson and Social Development Minister Carmel Sepuloni did with the wage subsidy scheme. This nearly $11 billion dollar investment has ensured that over a million and a half workers have stayed employed and connected to their jobs during the toughest period of the lockdown, while providing a guarantee to businesses to keep going as they can start to get back on their feet at Level 2. Sitting alongside the wage subsidy has been the largest suite of business tax changes in modern history, aimed at freeing up cash flow to support businesses when they couldn’t trade. And our no interest loan scheme provides much needed cash for things like rent and other costs as they get up and running. These measures have worked so far. Our unemployment rate will increase, but has not spiked so far. And Treasury scenarios suggest that because we stayed at level 4 and 3 for a shorter period of time our unemployment rate could end up be at the lower end of their projected ranges.Dealing to the virus quickly also allows other economic opportunities. A possible trans-Tasman bubble when safe could see New Zealand and Australia opening up greater tourism and trade opportunities while our borders have to stay closed to the rest of the world, offering some additional reprieve for our tourism and hospitality industries. But the next stage in our journey of rebuilding together is recovery. Our focus now is the jobs and incomes of businesses and new Zealanders.Budget 2020 is but the first step in this phase. In normal years the budget sets out the Government’s economic plans for the following year in detail. This budget is different. It is not business as usual, instead it is a tailored solution to a unique situation.There is no playbook for the recovery we are about to embark on. But nor do we need one. When it has come to COVID 19 we have carved a path based on our people, our health system, and our economy. And now that is exactly what we will do again, as we recover and rebuild. And let me say from the outset: The team and I will bring the same determination and focus to the economic rebuild as we brought to our health response.To start that phase, we need to consider what our objectives are and the best steps to achieve them. The Finance Minister will set out much of this tomorrow, and I won’t pre-empt anything he has to say on that, but today I can set out what we are trying to achieve, and the values we bring to this work.The first thing you will notice, is that we believe when times are hard, you don’t cut – you invest. We will run the ruler over every line of expenditure, no question we need to ensure our expenditure provides value for money and supports our primary goal of jobs. But the notion that at this time of need we would make cuts to the essential services so many New Zealanders need more than ever is not only immoral, it is economically wrong. That’s why yesterday we made the biggest investment in health funding in two decades. It’s why on Monday we delivered pay equity for early childhood teachers. It’s why one of the first things we did when the virus hit was to increase benefit rates to ensure those who lost their job had more to help them through. Now more than ever we need our schools and hospitals, our public houses and roads and railways. We need our police and our nurses, and we need our welfare safety net. We will not let our team of 5 million fall when the times get tough, instead we will strengthen the blanket of support the Government can provide. We are rebuilding together, not apart. These foundations are essential. They are out base. But on top of them we must build the things that accelerate employment, empower businesses, and stimulate our productive economy. A relentless focus on jobs, economy and businesses is what’s required now for the wellbeing of all New ZealandersProjections suggest our economic shock could be sharp, but hopefully short. That means we need a plan to get us through the worst and position us well for recovery. The biggest fiscal asset we currently have to get us through the worst is the Government’s balance sheet. Due to our prudent economic management of the books heading into the lockdown we had debt under 20% of GDP, lower than what we inherited it at, low unemployment around 4% and a triple A foreign currency rating from Moody’s. I defended the surpluses we ran in our first two budgets on the basis that we needed to prepare financially for a rainy day. Well that day has well and truly arrived and we are ready for it. The Government’s ability to borrow, at very low interest rates, places us in a strong position to weather the economic storm ahead. But more than that we are well positioned to use our balance sheet to shelter New Zealanders from the worst impacts of the fallout and in doing so protect jobs and help grow our economy. Our number one priority is jobs. That means this will be a jobs budget. That means doing all we can to support people staying in their current job or move to a new job if needed.And the reason for that is simple. It harks back to the sentiment of Norman Kirk, that all anyone ever needs is something to do, somewhere to live, someone to love and something to hope for. Employment helps form a foundation. It supports families, pays the bills, helps provide self-value and worth and when times are tough like this workplaces can provide an important support network. Our plan is to invest. By investing we will create jobs and get the economy moving again. Just as a rising tide lifts all boats, a growing economy supports us all – and allows us to bring the Government books back into the black. This is not the work of just one budget. It will require relentless focus on growth and jobs, and not growth for growth sakes – but in a way that acknowledges we have challenges to our environment, to our wellbeing, that we can also use this time to also help resolve. Tomorrow you will see how we will start to do that.But in the same way that have fought the virus together, we also need to start our rebuild together. That will take all of us. In the coming month the Government will launch a comprehensive engagement programme that will pose a simple proposition – look what our team of 5 million achieved together in beating the virus, now what can we do together to get our economy moving again, to look after our people, and rebuild in a way that make things better than they were before. That will of course include the business community, but it will be broader too. If anything the last few months have shown that united we are a formidable force. When we channel our energies into a goal collectively we are stronger for it. Prior to the virus we faced serious long term challenges – persistent inequality and poverty, the threat of climate change, the need to diversify the economy, low productivity, limited domestic manufacturing and an abundance of low paid jobs. Do we return to those settings or is now the time to find a better way?There are tough times to come, but we have experienced tough times before. And when confronted with external crisis, be it a great depression, a world war or now a global health pandemic our instinct has been to come together.And we will again. We will use the strength of our economic position as a Government’s to carry the load while businesses and households get back on their feet. The situation is constantly changing and the future may feel uncertain. But as I said right at the beginning – we have a plan. We know it will be tough but we will get through it the same way we got through the past two months – together."
2020-05-12T00:05:39Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Winston Peters                    ,  Emergency Support for Racing ,"Emergency support for racing “Out of the gate and going for the winning post”Good afternoon.Today we are making a Pre-Budget announcement on emergency support assistance for the New Zealand racing industry.We knew from the beginning of the COVID-19 invasion that the racing industry was facing an unparalleled crisis in its history.We immediately alerted the Minister of Finance, and our officials started working on a recovery plan.Our response is driven by an attitude that with the right investment it can be a fast recovery. Guiding government strategy are three steps – to respond, to recover, and rebuild – in the immediate term.Today’s Pre-Budget announcement is the initial response – not only critical to racing but critical to our national interests.The racing industry is seriously underestimated for its important contribution to our regions and our economy.Past studies indicate it contributes $1.6 billion to the economy each year. There are 15,000 full time racing industry jobs and nearly 60,000 indirect jobs participating in some form – from vets, to equipment suppliers, and owners.There are 15,000 owners, 800 trainers, and 200 jockeys.  Not only is New Zealand bloodstock world class – it’s a significant export earner.And all facing an unprecedented threat.It is well documented the racing industry has experienced several years of financial under-performance.It was partway through a reform programme. Then COVID-19 arrived. As one expert put it, this has created the perfect storm. We can’t gild the lily. It is taking the industry to the brink of insolvency.It is a matter of urgency for the Government to provide support.We have to protect what we have – and we have to rebuild for the future.A 50 million dollar grantFor this reason the Government has approved an immediate $50 million dollar grant to be provided for the Racing Industry Transition Agency – RITA.A good proportion of this money - $26 million dollars - will be used so that RITA can honour its outstanding supplier payments. RITA, and the operation of the TAB, is cash reliant.  There has been a dramatic plunge in revenue while costs have remained fixed, and the bills have been backing up.  RITA’s lenders also advised they could no longer extend credit. It means RITA has faced the risk of defaulting on it’s supplier commitments by this Friday. It would have been devastating for many in the regions.So $26 million of this initial grant will be directed to supplier commitments.The rest allows RITA and each of the racing codes to maintain a baseline functionality and to resume racing activities.As mentioned, this is the government’s initial response.Treasury engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers to provide a financial assessment of RITA.The PWC’s analysis underlined that RITA has a very weak equity position.And that an immediate grant was the most effective means to prevent default. PWC also advised close consideration should be given to recapitalising RITA. This work will proceed over the next three months. Our plan wants the industry to achieve value-add to the economy. And we are calling upon the industry to deliver serious reform.That is necessary for the government to be confident that any future investment is well directed.  Infrastructure spending – fast track with synthetic race tracksThe government is also creating momentum for two more synthetic race tracks.Compelling arguments exist behind synthetic race tracks because they reduce the number of cancelled events due to weather or poor surfaces.For example in the 2018 year there were 32 races abandoned which cost the industry millions of dollars.In other words synthetic tracks offer consistency and reliability. Synthetic tracks sustain a higher workload for both training and racing.There are much fewer abandoned races days.That translates to retaining income, and not losing it.And they are safer for the horse.The Messara review into our racing industry urged greater use of synthetic tracks.   Construction of a track in Cambridge is under way assisted with $6.5 million PFG funding.But in the wake of COVID-19 the Government has approved up to $20 million dollars on a further two tracks.   The intention is to have one located at Awapuni in the Manawatu, and the other at Riccarton Park in Christchurch.We not only want to save the industry we want it to have viable assets for the future.The next step is for RITA and the Codes to consult with the local race clubs on the terms behind these projects, and the Clubs willingness to engage.Fast track work on gambling revenueThe COVID-19 has also caused a funding slump for community and sports groups who normally receive a share of gambling revenue. And more New Zealanders are turning to online gambling through offshore platforms. Both trends are concerning.  For that reason government is fast tracking a programme of work to identify how we can mitigate these concerns.It is our intention to regulate the off-shore online gambling sector, and reset the on-shore online gambling sector.If there is going to be gambling by New Zealanders then it is our country that will benefit, not another.And in doing so, we will be better able to address harm minimisation, and make sure our community benefits.The industry leadership and the futureWe are in this together.  The government is responding. The industry also has to respond as well.The management teams at RITA and the Codes have tightened their belts.They also are managing difficult decisions on staffing levels.  Nothing is the same. Now is the time to try different approaches. And the industry is adapting.Sadly, there has been some internal squabbling in racing circles. Some blame the transition agency for the problems it inherited.Look to be honest, we have had enough of mostly old men leaning against the rails scratching their derriere, and blaming everyone else.Fortunately common sense is prevailing.  Most in the industry accept collaboration is the key to recovery. That is good because, generally speaking, if you are in financial difficulty it’s a bad time to be rude to the bank manager.So finally, let us thank the RITA Board and its management team for its responsive leadership.Thank the racing codes management teams for focusing and moving quickly to achieve a resumption of racing. And a note of appreciation for the departmental officials for their tireless work to date.All of us know the hard work has only just begin,In the long term, if we get all the steps correct, there is no reason why racing in this country cannot be a world class industry, stronger than ever.  We are out of the gate but we have distance to cover before we get to the home strait and the winning post.That said, we are going to make racing great again.Ends"
2020-05-11T04:43:10Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  Level 2 announcement,"I want to start today by acknowledging the sacrifices New Zealanders have made over the six and a half weeks we have been in Alert Levels 4 and 3 in order to beat COVID-19.Be it those who lost loved ones and were unable to say goodbye and mourn properly.Be it the children who wrote to me about missing birthdays, and there were many of them, or the many who cancelled weddings or didn’t mark anniversaries.Be it the jobs that have been lost and the businesses that owners spent years building up only to watch it and their workforce suffer terribly.But for all of that, Kiwis from all walks of life were resolute and determined.Determined that this was a war we could eventually win, but only if we acted together. So we formed a team, and as a team we created a wall of protection for one another.Over the weekend I read a letter from a mother who spoke about what that team effort has meant to her.Her young son has compromised immunity and as a result is on constant medication. When COVID arrived in the form of a global pandemic she was terrified. But she was writing to me out of sheer relief. There may be no cure, no vaccine for COVID yet, but there was each and every one of you. Every single Kiwi who made the decision to stay home. To make sacrifices. You did that for her boy.You did it for someone’s mother. Someone’s father. Someone’s child. You created a wall that meant the virus couldn’t reach those that it could easily take. And for that, there are many people who are grateful to you – their team of 5 million.Case numbers remain low, and in the last week we have had two days in a row of no cases.By the end of Level 4 our R value, the number of people each case goes on to infect was 0.4. Under Level 3 it has remained low. Experts tell us that if the R value stays below 1 we will eventually achieve our goal of elimination.As of today we have only 90 New Zealanders recorded as having the virus of whom only 2 are in hospital.None of that has been through luck, but hard work. While we have been battling the virus, we have also built up our health system specifically to act as a defence.We can now undertake up to 12,000 tests a day. 3.5 per cent of the entire population has been tested and our testing rates are amongst the highest in the world per-capita, ahead of countries like Australia, the UK, Germany, Singapore and South Korea.A lot of work has gone into building up our contact tracing capability. Dr Ayesha Verrall’s report has been instrumental in this regard and the majority of the recommendations have been implemented.We can now contact trace 185 cases a day and have capacity to contact 10,000 people a day through a new national call centre, established since the beginning of the outbreak.Identifying new cases of the virus quickly through testing and rapid contact tracing can be 90 per cent as effective as a vaccine in stopping the spread of the virus. But I cannot emphasise enough that speed is of the essence. The clock starts as soon as someone feels sick. If you have COVID, we need every minute to find the people you have been in contact with and isolate them before they are in contact with someone else.In short, if you have a sniffle, or a sore throat, or a cough – get advice and get a test. Quickly. Please don’t be a stoic Kiwi.If you do your bit, we all must keep doing ours. That means continuing our strong border controls, hand hygiene and physical distancing which have, and will continue, to be our primary wall of defence against COVID.They’re tools that have worked.But we all know there is more to do. We may have won a few battles, but we have not won the war.We are still recording cases most days.New information about the virus indicates it could be spread prior to a person becoming symptomatic, meaning it can be passed on by seemingly healthy people.And the scientists who have advised us so well to date, say there is still a chance of silent spread in the future and therefore cases taking off again.So, today I am announcing that Cabinet agrees we are ready to move into Level 2, to open up the economy, but to do it as safely as possible.Let me set out how we will do that.On Thursday this week retail, malls, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and other public spaces including playgrounds and gyms, can reopen. All will be required to have physical distancing and strict hygiene measures in place.You can begin to move around New Zealand, but space yourself out especially if you’re using public transport.And of course health services will restart.On Monday 18 May, all children and young people will be able to return to school and early learning. This staging is to give parents, teachers and education facilities time to plan.And finally, on Thursday 21 May, bars will be able to open with all the requirements set out last week, including that seating must be provided, there must be space between tables, and there mustn’t be multiple waiters and waitresses serving a single table.We have left bars till last because they do pose the most risk, as we can see from South Korea that recently opened up there bars, only to close them again after one person created an outbreak of 40 people and 1500 tests.While we have put in place measures and expectations to make all hospitality as safe as possible, these few extra days really do give us a chance to lock in the data from level three and feel more secure that we’re ready for this move.Overall though, the upshot is that in 10 days’ time we will have reopened most businesses in New Zealand, and sooner than many other countries around the world. But that fits with our plan – go hard, go early – so we can get our economy moving again sooner, and so we get the economic benefit of getting our health response right.And so far, we have.But there does have to be a new normal. And that normal means that we will be breaking out of our bubbles, we will be around more people. But we can do that, and get more activity going, if we balance that with keeping our distance, and keeping our social gatherings small for now.Our strength so far has been our willingness to learn about this virus and change the way we behave to beat it.And we have learnt a lot, especially from our clusters. If you’ve followed their origin, you’ll know that are a slice of Kiwi life. They have started at wedding receptions, stag dos, a conference in Queenstown that included drinks and socialising, a bar in Matamata. There is a theme – when we come together to socialise in large numbers with one another, there is risk. The best insurance policy we have for that risk, is to reduce the size of our socialising for now. And that is what the Director General of Health has recommended we do, for now.Parties, big social events or anything designed to be for mixing and mingling won’t be allowed to happen for groups larger than 10 people.Gatherings at home, need to be capped at 10. Church and religious events, weddings, funerals, stag dos – all must be limited to 10 for now.And if you’re wanting to head to a restaurant, or a bar, they won’t be able to take group bookings larger than 10. This, alongside social distancing, is our insurance policy.And why 10? Simple. If something goes wrong with a group of 10, that’s much easier to contain, much easier to contact trace, and much less likely that if something goes wrong that the whole country will have to experience more restrictions.That doesn’t mean you won’t see larger gatherings than this. People will be at the movies – but they’ll be spaced out. They’ll be watching sports, but spaced out. People might go to show, but they’ll be spaced out. You’ll see bars and restaurants open – but they’ll be required to have people seated, and spaced out.We have done what we can to prioritise opening up businesses, but just alter the way we work within them for the next wee while. This strikes the balance between getting the economy moving, but also making sure we have got the next stage right.I know that many New Zealanders are looking forward to catching up with friends and family, and from this Thursday you can.But for now it needs to be small. This is a transition out of bubbles, where you can see people you haven’t seen in a while; you just can’t do it all at once.I should also add that if you have a family that is larger than 10, you don’t need to throw anyone out of the house. We are being pragmatic. But we don’t want you having a big gathering yet.This is also one of the reasons we decided to allow travel again as we signalled last week. It wasn’t so much the movement around the country – it was what people did when they got there that mattered. So go and see your mum – just don’t turn it into a massive family reunion while you’re at it. Instead, maybe visit a local tourism site or support a local business.We will look at these remaining restrictions again in two weeks’ time and if our numbers continue to look good the number of people you can socialise with, and hold events with, will grow.Last Thursday when announcing what Level 2 looks like I said the key rule is to play it safe. That we all need to take individual responsibility for our actions and continue to behave like the virus is still amongst us, especially when in public and among people we don’t know.At level 4 and 3 we had success because staying home meant we broke the chain of transmission. We simply weren’t in contact with others to spread the virus.At Level 2 we are now out and about again, just about all parts of the economy are opening up again. What we have balanced in these decisions, is how we can do that, get restaurants opens, malls open, shops open, but also how we can keep them open.That’s why we are asking you all to be incredibly careful as we get back to a new safer normal. None of us can assume COVID isn’t with us.So with that in mind, a reminder of the golden rules of Level 2:Keep your distance from other people when you are out in public, including on transport.If you’re sick, stay home. Don’t go to work or school. Don’t socialise. This should be a really low bar.If you have symptoms of cold or flu call your doctor or Healthline immediately and get tested.Wash your hands. Wash your hands. Wash your hands. Do it properly.Don’t get together socially or mix and mingle with more than 10 people at once.And keep a track of where you’ve been and who you’ve seen.Your efforts New Zealand have got us to this place ahead of most of the world and without the carnage COVID inflicted in many other places.But there are risks ahead, so please be vigilant at level 2. Irresponsible behaviour will take us backwards.Getting to this position early has saved jobs and businesses but there is a long road ahead to full recovery, and things will continue to be very, very tough before they get better. We are looking to provide more support for the businesses most affected, and to do that soon.This week the Government will release our Budget, our plan to respond to the economic toll the virus has caused.It will be one of many steps we take in our efforts to rebuild together.In fact that is what the Budget is called, “Rebuilding together”. At its heart it is the simple idea that our team of 5 million has united to beat the virus, now together we can also unite to rebuild our economy.And that there is an opportunity to build back even better addressing issues like inequality, our run-down infrastructure and challenges to our environment.The Finance Minister will have much, much more to say on that on Thursday.For now we are in Level 3 for just two more days.From Thursday when you wake up, play it safe.Remember that wall of defence we built together as a team, now rests with every one of us. So when you’re out and about acknowledge your fellow team mates. Enjoy being out more, and seeing others – but keep it small, keep your distance, and be kind."

Thanks for joining me.Before I start I do want to apologise in advance for the length of these remarks – and I don’t expect all of you will want to stay to the end – except perhaps those deeply ingrained in these issues. In the current environment, meeting large audiences face to face is out of the question. So it seemed that a Facebook Live video was a good way to address these important issues in what would otherwise have been delivered in a public speech.My comments today are intended especially for the legal profession, academics and media covering these issues.There are plenty of commentators poring over every remark made by the Prime Minister, the Director-General of Health and me - and there will be some who will ask whether I am trying to influence court proceedings upcoming and may argue I should not have made these comments.However, I would reflect on the fact that the tone of some of those attacks has the potential, and is sometimes intended, to undermine public confidence in the measures that we have all taken to stamp out Covid-19. Those measure are vital to saving many lives and important for our economy, but ultimately rely mainly on voluntary compliance and trust in the Police powers to enforce significant breaches  I feel it is proper for me as Attorney-General to make these comments. More so, because we have seen in other countries the impact of public confidence being undermined. I don’t want to see that happen. It would be a strange outcome if critics can publicly critique, but I cannot justify.For the record, I asked the Solicitor-General to pass on to the judiciary a message that the invitation to this Facebook Live speech via the New Zealand Law Society was not directed to them, and this is not an attempt to influence them. I will though, at the end, comment on measures being taken as the Courts reopen more widely.The global COVID-19 pandemic is a matter of major concern to all.  It has led the Government to declare only its second ever state of national emergency, and to issue an Epidemic Notice in relation to the virus.  The Government has adopted an Alert Level system together with our strategy for COVID-19, which aims to stop the spread of the virus, stamp it out and save thousands of lives.  Our response has been dictated by the nature of the threat that we suddenly faced as a nation and a Government.There is no vaccine, there is no cure, and the health advice was clear. If we wanted to avoid the awful loss of life we saw unfolding overseas, and to prevent our health system being overwhelmed, we should wash our hands, practice good hygiene but most of all we had to keep physically distant from one another.The measures we took put the most significant restrictions on New Zealanders’ movements in modern history and closed our borders to overseas travellers in an unprecedented way. Yet together New Zealanders embraced the challenge and as a nation we’ve achieved an extraordinary feat, though we mourn the loss of 21 loved ones. Our goal of stamping out the virus within our shores has seen the number of new cases dwindle to less than a handful. We had feared for our hospital system. As of yesterday just two Covid patients were in hospital and none was in intensive care. Looking overseas we can see that together we have saved thousands of lives.Today I want to discuss the steps we took, the legal underpinning of our lockdown decisions and refute some of the speculation you may have heard questioning the legality of the powers of enforcement, including erroneous claims about the legal advice we have received. Let me say it again, as I have previously, that on the advice we have received from Crown Law there is no gap in the legality of the powers of enforcement under levels 3 and 4. This issue is the subject of judicial determination and that will be resolved soon. The courts are where – quite rightly – disputes will be determined.  I also want to explain my position on privilege, and why I have to date refused to release Crown Law’s specific legal advice – even though it supports the legality of the Government’s position. I will address the rationale for legal professional privilege and why that is equally applicable to the Crown.  Indeed legal professional privilege is essential for good government, as I set out later.  I also want to highlight the dangerous route the Opposition is taking in targeting public servants. By summonsing to the Epidemic Response Committee the Solicitor-General, the Police Commissioner and the Director-General of Health (when they would no doubt have agreed to a simple request to appear) in order to attempt to force the disclosure of privileged legal advice. By doing this the Committee is attacking not just fair processs but the privileges of the Court. Legal privilege is not Parliament’s. Parliament has its own parliamentary privilege, and it is not for the Courts to remove that. Legal privilege is grounded in the common law. It is the Courts not Parliament that have care of legal privilege. We must both make efforts not to intrude on each other’s privileges.  The current attack on that is an attack on comity – the constitutional separation of powers – between Parliament and the courts. That constitutional outrage is made worse in my view because it comes at a time when the Crown is facing legal action over the lockdown laws. I should put on record that the Chair of the committee The Honourable Simon Bridges was offered a confidential briefing on the advice and declined. I also note the questions I received on the legal basis for the Government’s actions by the Select Committee were cursory when I appeared before the committee and I have not been asked back.Let me now set out the steps we have taken so far; to outline the statutory framework and legal underpinnings to those steps.  As you will know aspects of legality are currently before the Courts, so my approach today can only be a high-level one. I emphasise at the outset that I am satisfied the Director-General’s orders were lawfully made.  Further, there has always been a lawful basis for enforcement action by Police, under both the Health Act and the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002.Background To give context to the legal discussion, I will first sketch out some necessary background matters.COVID-19 was added to the list of notifiable and quarantinable infectious diseases under the Health Act 1956 earlier this year. Shortly after the WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, there was evidence of community transmission emerging in New Zealand. This was in mid-March. Prior to this, all cases could be traced to overseas travel or contact with a known case. Modelling suggested that unless measures were put in place to break the chain of transmission, case numbers would increase exponentially, overwhelming health services, resulting in extra mortality amongst New Zealanders. On 21 March 2020, the Prime Minister announced the National Four Stage Alert System.  We set out to stop and stamp out COVID-19. Right from the start we have been educating and giving guidelines to the public about how to protect themselves and others, and how to avoid the potentially catastrophic impact of the virus.  Public understanding of these issues and voluntary compliance with what needs to be done has always been key. As I have said significant legal restrictions were also needed to stop the continued transmission of COVID-19.  It was also clear at the early stage that international travel represented the highest risk area, so strict border controls would be needed.  That remains the position now.  On 25 March 2020, the Epidemic Preparedness (COVID-19) Notice 2020 came into force. It provided that the Prime Minister was satisfied the effects of the outbreak were likely to disrupt or continue to significantly disrupt essential government and business activity in New Zealand.On 25 March 2020, a state of national emergency was declared.  It has been extended 6 times and is currently in place until 12 May. When she announced it the Prime Minister said that the purpose of the state of national emergency was to fight a global pandemic, save New Zealanders’ lives and prevent the very worst that we’ve seen around the world from happening here.New Zealand went to Alert Level 4 at 11:59pm, 25 March 2020, and down to Level 3 at 11.59 on 27 April.  The Director-General gave orders/directions to the public about permissible conduct at each of these levels, reflecting his view of the prevailing public health risks and steps necessary to mitigate those risks.  Parliamentary adjustmentsConsistent with that, and in parallel with the above, on 25 March 2020, Parliament was adjourned until 2 pm on Tuesday, 28 April 2020. This followed a number of earlier preparatory steps. The courts themselves saw the situation as so serious that they had already on March 18 of their own volition suspended new jury trials until the end of May, then extended to the end of July. This suspension of the right of an untried accused to have their day in court – and perhaps not be found guilty  and released shows the seriousness that all New Zealand institutions put on the crisis. The House adopted a number of procedures included empowering the Business Committee to meet and make determinations by electronic means, including remote participation; and removing the 25 per cent limit on proxy votes that may be cast by a party during a party vote. The rules also empowered the Speaker to approve special arrangements for select committees to meet and conduct business.On 25 March 2020, the Epidemic Response Committee was established by the House. The Committee was to consider and report to the House any matter relating to the Government's management of the COVID-19 epidemic. This was seen as “a mechanism, whereby the Opposition in particular, will be able to continue to scrutinise the Government and the actions that the Government is taking, even though the House will not be sitting”.At 2 p.m. on 28 April 2020, Parliament resumed sitting. However, to ensure physical distancing only 33 members of Parliament are allowed to be seated in the Chamber at any one time; and Members can lodge their oral questions electronically, rather than on paper.Sittings are shorter than usual and there are no members’ days. For the 3 week sitting block any Bills referred to Select Committee can be debated immediately after being reported back to the House, rather than being delayed to the third sitting day.  Orders made by Director-General of HealthI return now to the legal basis for the orders made by the Director-General of Health. Section 70 of the Health Act provides a medical officer of health with special powers to make a wide range of orders for the purpose of preventing the outbreak or spread of an infectious disease, if authorised to do so by the Minister of Health; or if a state of emergency has been declared; or while an epidemic notice is in force.  Both the issuing of the epidemic notice and the declaration of a state of emergency thus activated the special powers.  The Director-General (and a Director of Public Health) then decided to make a series of orders under s70, in light of the health information and risks known at the time. The orders are all available on the Government’s COVID-19 website.Several relate to the handling of people arriving into New Zealand, who were at first directed to self-isolate at home, but now requires them to be isolated or quarantined for 14-days at specified facilities, with some (albeit limited) personal movement allowed.  New arrivals must also submit to a medical examination and, as required, testing for the virus. Orders have been made that forbid people from congregating in outdoor places of amusement or recreation; and which close premises, with exceptions.  The closures became significantly less restrictive under the Director-General’s Alert Level 3 Order of 27 April, where the controlling measure for opening premises of businesses or services became in general whether relevant infection control measures are in place.    The Director-General has made specific orders that isolate and quarantine people by requiring them to remain at their homes except as permitted for essential personal movement.   Again, what constitutes essential personal movement has expanded under Alert Level 3.All orders have ensured people can access the necessities of life and move around in situations of emergency and exemptions are allowed for.   Again, I’m acutely conscious legality issues are before the Courts. At a high level the components which the government points to for the legality of the s 70 orders are:  The necessary preconditions (Ministerial authorisation, state of emergency, or epidemic notice) were established at the time each of the orders were made (as stated at the start of each order).  The orders were made by authorised medical officers of health, exercising their discretion personally and based on their expert assessments as to the measures necessary to prevent the outbreak and spread of COVID-19.  Those orders were explicitly made for that purpose.Relevant public law considerations, including the public health assessments and analysis, were taken into account by the decision-makers before the s 70 powers were exercised.  There has been some debate as to whether the Director-General could legitimately isolate or quarantine the entire nation under s 70(1)(f) of the Health Act. I consider that subsection is apt to cover a direction to all New Zealanders for isolation and quarantine, with exceptions as mentioned and is not limited to use only in relation to specified individuals. The provision is that persons can be isolated or quarantined (with no statutory pre-condition that they may have or carry the disease), so there is no stretch of language; and this is entirely consistent with the purpose of these powers – which is to prevent the outbreak or spread of infectious disease.  I observe that the powers set out in s 70 may be contrasted with the powers in Part 3A of the Health Act, which apply to the conduct of an “individual” considered by a medical officer of health to constitute a public health risk.  In cases under Part 3A, the directions in question are directed to the “individual” concerned.The interpretation and approach taken by the Director-General has of course recently been confirmed by Justice Peters in the habeas judgements A & B v Ardern & Ors, where Her Honour accepted that the orders which may be made under s 70(1) are very broad and that the reference to “persons” in s 70(1)(f) is capable of encompassing the entire population.   Bill of Rights Act The Director-General of Health, acting as a medical officer of health, is required to exercise his powers consistently with the New Zealand Bill of Right Act.  Thus the orders he has made cannot breach the rights affirmed in the BORA.Isolation and quarantine requirements, the general prohibition of outdoor public congregation and restricted access to premises, are all measures that limit our rights to freedom of movement, association and assembly.  To be lawful, they must be reasonable limits that are demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.  This means the measures must serve a sufficiently important objective, and be proportionate (in that they are rationally connected to the purpose, limit the rights no more than is reasonably necessary, and are in due proportion to the importance of the objective). As I said earlier, there is no vaccine, no cure for this disease and the medical advice self-evidently based on real and recent overseas experience is that left unchecked the disease would cause the death of thousands of New Zealanders and cause serious economic harm.The objective of the s 70 orders is legitimate and of significant public importance – preventing the spread of Covid-19, eradicating the disease, protecting public health and saving lives, and ensuring the sustainability of our health system.  Given the public health assessment of risks to New Zealand and need for strict compliance to control the spread, I considered and still consider the measures imposed are a necessary and proportionate response.  Preventing the spread of the virus could not be achieved in a less liberty-restricting way, acknowledging that the restrictions have been loosened and tailored as time has passed to reflect the nature and stage of the risk. I am mindful also that there have always been exceptions and exclusions available.  The more stringent isolation and quarantine requirements that relate to those who arrive in New Zealand are similarly justifiable, given the high risk posed by overseas travel and consequent threat to public health from those entering New Zealand, and having regard to the period and nature of confinement which is necessary to contain the public health risk.    The measures have also engaged other rights set out in the BORA, such as the rights of minorities in s 20. They could potentially limit the right to be free from discrimination affirmed in section 19(1) of BORA, in that the same treatment could have differential and disadvantageous effects on some groups.  Interference with these rights can be justified, given the significant public health objective.  It is not possible to go into this in more detail at this juncture, but I make the point so that people are aware that impacts on human rights are being taken into account.  I am very mindful of the coercive controls that have been imposed under the s 70 orders but all of the orders are compliant with the Bill of Rights Act.  I should highlight here that the Solicitor-General has put in place an inter-agency process to keep all relevant legal instruments under scrutiny to ensure they have a firm legal basis, are sufficiently well-defined, can be demonstrably justified in the circumstances, and remain proportionate to the threat posed by COVID-19. I conclude this section by saying that legal challenges to certain of the Director-General’s decisions and/or orders have now been commenced in Court.  As I said at the outset, this has necessarily constrained me in what I can say.   While the Crown will conduct a robust defence, now, as should occur under our constitutional structure, it is the Courts that will determine the legality of the challenged decisions.  Enforcement powers Section 71A of the Health Act provides Police with various powers to assist medical officers of health:  to prevent persons from obstructing or hindering the medical officers, and/or to compel/enforce/ensure compliance with a requirement made by a medical officer of health.Section 72 of the Health Act sets out offences relating to obstructing a medical officer of health in the exercise or performance of his or her powers or functions, and obstructing or hindering a constable acting under s 71A.  Police are empowered to arrest without warrant for these offences. The s 70 notices set out clear expectations and behavioural requirements that all New Zealanders can understand, and there is a clear basis for Police constables to enforce these requirements under s 71A.  They must, however, be exercised lawfully in each particular case.For the duration of the state of emergency, Police also have emergency and enforcement powers under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act.  The use of these powers is assessed against the purpose of the declaration – that is to slow the spread and reduce the impact of COVID-19 (and thereby save lives). These include the power to enter premises, restrict public access to roads or places, and to direct and request people to stop activities or take actions to limit the extent of the emergency.  These powers too must be exercised lawfully.  The notices under s 70 of the Health Act provide clarity as to behavioural requirements and permissible movements, and hence clarity as to the exercise of these powers. Legal professional privilege – purpose and scopeThere has been a high level of interest in the specific legal advice that has been provided throughout this emergency.  This Facebook Live event gives me the opportunity to talk about legal professional privilege.The purpose of legal professional privilege is to enable legal advice to be sought and given in confidence. The basic principles arise from the public interest requiring full and frank exchange of confidence between solicitor and client to enable the client to receive necessary legal advice.  It is a necessary corollary to the right of any person to obtain skilled advice about the law. People must be able to consult their lawyers in absolute confidence, as otherwise they might hold back information, in fear it may afterwards be disclosed and used to their prejudice. This is why the House of Lords has described legal professional privilege as much more than an ordinary rule of evidence; it is a fundamental condition on which the administration of justice as a whole rests. Similarly, legal professional privilege has been said to be a fundamental right, long established at common law.These principles have been endorsed on numerous occasions.As Professor Andrew Geddis has said of legal privilege: “That privilege allows the Crown (as is the case with any client) to refuse to divulge the advice’s content, and it exists for a very good reason. Privilege permits legal advisers to give their full and frank views on the legal risks and challenges involved in any particular policy decision. Receiving that full and frank advice then helps the government to make the best decision on the matter at had.Without such legal privilege in place, legal advisers may hedge and trim their views to avoid having them rebound on their client (the crown) at a later date. So, rather than saying “this policy proposal has very weak legal foundations and there is a high risk it will be overturned if challenged in court”, they may instead say “there might be a potential legal issue with this policy proposal”. Which actually would be bad for deciding what is the best thing to do.So, given that there’s another institution in place that is going to examine the lockdown rules’ legality (the courts), and the institutional value in enabling the crown to receive full and frank legal advice, it probably would be best if the Epidemic Response Committee backed off here. It probably doesn’t need to inquire into this issue, and by doing so it may well do longer term harm to our processes of government.”Legal professional privilege - waiverOnce established, legal privilege is absolute and can only be removed by statute or by client waiver. (Under the Cabinet Manual, it is the Attorney-General who has the right to determine and be consulted on whether the privilege in any legal advice given to the Crown should be waived.)  On occasion I will proactively waive the Crown’s privilege in legal advice because there are issues which the public need to understand. This often happens when we are looking backwards after a significant lapse in time, for example the Crown has waived privilege in respect of a lot of advice through the years relating to abuse in state care. A lot of but not all advice given in relation to abuse in state care has been released. On occasion we do it with select committees on condition that advice is kept confidential to the committee.This Select Committee is purporting to take power to themselves to waive privilege. (The committee I would add was set up with the leader of the Opposition as its chair and with a majority of Opposition MPs in a signal by the Government of its willingness to allow scrutiny at a time the House could not sit.)We have been more open than many countries in this regard and this reflects well on our democracy.Why did it just target the Crown? Imagine if the plaintiff in the habeas corpus case or other applicants were forced to disclose their legal advice.Where there is litigation on foot, everyone, including the Government, must be entitled to retain their privilege and defend themselves in Court without any risk of prejudice arising by way of disclosure of privileged communications.Legal professional privilege in the public serviceIt is clear that the Crown can rely on legal professional privilege in respect of the legal advice it receives (from departmental legal advisers, from the Crown Law Office, or advice from outside legal firms to either Ministers or government agencies). The privilege is expressly recognised in the Official Information Act 1982 and confirmed in the Cabinet Manual 2017. Government needs to be able to rely on legal professional privilege just like anyone else.  It enables government decision makers to have clear advice from their lawyers about the extent of their powers, and the risks.  Their legal advisors need also to be free to be frank about the same issues to decision makers.  Courts in Australia the UK and New Zealand have upheld the importance of legal professional privilege in the public sector.Government needs to obtain frank legal advice from their advisors without the potential chilling effect that the prospect of possible disclosure would have.  A select committee can ask me or the Solicitor-General or Police to again explain the basis of their powers. A select committees can ask for its own legal advice. None of these things are closed to them.But according to McGee’s Parliamentary Practice in New Zealand “the House has acknowledged that a legal opinion is the property of the person who commissioned it, and that a select committee cannot expect the opinion to be furnished to it without the consent of the owner”.In my opinion the current effort to turn over centuries of legal principle is not just unprincipled but may in fact be beyond the powers of the Select Committee. An important matter of comity with the courts, and a matter of constitutional principle is raised. I will be asking the Speaker of the House to refer the matter to the privileges committee to consider. Constitutional law experts may themselves be interested to reflect on whether this issue is the mirror opposite of what was considered in the privileges committee decision arising out of purported limitations to Parliamentary Privilege in breach of the 1688 Bill of Rights division of powers. I’m not sure that even Parliament has the jurisdiction to do what the Select Committee is seeking to do. Turning back to the underlying substance, recent speculation that our legal advice throws doubt on the legal basis is wrong. It appears to be based on draft views provided to agencies for feedback. That was not the considered advice of Crown Law, which was that there was no gap in enforcement powers.Level 2 powers   The position under level 2 will be different.A new law providing a legal framework for Covid-19 Alert Level 2 will be introduced and debated next week.The changes we propose will ensure that controls on gatherings of people and physical distancing are still enforceable. Enforceability to date has relied on the Epidemic Notice, the Health Act and the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act. There will be fewer restrictions under Alert Level 2 but those remaining still need to be enforceable. We don’t want these narrower controls to rely on a National State of Emergency. I reiterate what the Prime Minister has said: There has been no gap in the legal underpinning or in the enforcement powers under the notices that have been issued under Level 3 and Level 4. The proposed changes we are making are not retrospective and do not need to be.The new law will also:Recognise the centrality of health factors in the measures we need to take;Provide that the Minister of Health become the decision maker on the advice of the Director-General of Health; (we have been listening to some of the academic commentary that that is a more proper route).Provide a transparent basis for how the rules will work and how they can be enforced;Provide for economic and social factors to be taken into account in determining appropriate measures.The country has achieved considerable success in addressing the Covid-19 threat. We have all given up some of our liberties as we have worked together to save thousands of lives. We have taken into account civil liberties and other human rights. As we reduce strictures and restore freedoms, we expect the vast majority of New Zealanders will continue to comply voluntarily with the necessary measures at all Alert Levels, but as we have consistently said, we will need to enforce the rules where there is serious non-compliance.The importance of Courts continuing to operateAccess to justice and access to the courts is a fundamental aspect of the rule of law in Aotearoa. As much as is possible, within the constraints of the epidemic and Alert Level restrictions, we have been striving to maintain this. The courts also have an important role to play in scrutinising the actions of the Executive, and this may be particularly so during a crisis or emergency such as this.Under the leadership of the Chief Justice of New Zealand, the Heads of Bench have worked together to develop clear protocols to ensure that as an essential service, our courts can continue to operate. At Alert Level 4, this work included the prioritisation of categories of hearings – those that affect liberty, those that affect personal safety and wellbeing and those that are time-sensitive matters. These are the hearings that have the most impact on the welfare of New Zealanders and maintaining this service ensured that those who are more vulnerable were not further disadvantaged, even at a time when New Zealanders day-to-day activity was severely restricted. This also reflect the rights to liberty, to minimum standards of criminal procedure and justice that are affirmed in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act. These are fundamental rights and a corner stone of our judicial system. As changes to the COVID-19 alert levels have occurred, Heads of Bench have also worked closely with the judiciary to expand service delivery as safely as possible.There have also been legislative amendments to enable better access to justice through enabling more use of audio-visual links technology. For example, amendments to the Oaths and Declarations Act, the Wills Act, and the Personal and Property Rights Act enable people to make an oath, declaration, or affirmation, or sign or witness documents via AVL (or phone in the case of the Oaths and Declarations Act) rather than requiring a physical presence.On PPE and safety You will have heard the Prime Minister speak to the need to continue a way of life that protects us all from the spread of COVID-19.  In our courts, the health and safety of all participants, as well as staff, has been paramount since day one. The cleaning regime the Ministry of Justice implemented at court buildings across the country has been comprehensive and in line with Ministry of Health guidelines. I hope this, alongside other measures such as contact tracing registers and drop boxes for filing, has given you an assurance that they are doing their best to keep everyone safe inside the court buildings. Many court users have asked what they can do to keep themselves and others safe.  The normal hygiene rules apply.  And, in addition, the Chief Justice has confirmed that those attending court in person are able to use their own PPE while in the courtroom. For anybody coming in the main entrance of a court building, the Ministry of Justice will provide PPE if the participant requests it.Please also do continue to approach local site managers with any concerns about health and safety in the courts. Your feedback whether that be ideas or constructive criticism is crucial as we ensure access to justice continues, in a safe environment, for those who need it most.  The profession plays an important role in providing access to justice. Thank you for your patience and understanding as you’ve adapted to the new ways in which the courts are having to work. The challenges have been significant but your work to ensure that New Zealanders can still meaningfully participate in the legal system and effectively assert their legal rights is essential. The individual impact this disruption has had on individuals, particularly victims and witnesses, is something the Judiciary with support from the Ministry of Justice will be working hard to address as restrictions ease across the country.Courthouses serve an important role as the local face of justice for their communities and the Chief Justice of New Zealand has stressed that our system of justice is a face-to-face and in person system, which she sees as a fundamental aspect. She has indicated that the end of the COVID-19 emergency will predominantly see face-to-face justice return in courthouses around New Zealand. Working closely with the judiciary, the Ministry where possible will also look at how to keep measures that have improved accessibility and efficiency for the justice system. As has occurred in the moves to Level 4 and Level 3, the Judiciary will share practice notes about how the courts will operate in Level 2. Ngā mihi. Thank you. "
2020-05-07T03:05:47Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  Alert Level 2 restrictions announced,"For six weeks now, our lives have been quite different. We have gone from a lockdown, into Level 3 and the reopening of parts of our economy, as our team of 5 million has stuck to our strategy of going hard and going early to win the battle against COVID-19.We can be proud of what we achieved. Low numbers of new cases, and 2 days where we were without any. Increases in testing, including actively testing those who might be at risk of COVID-19 as we hunt to find any burning embers of the virus. Amongst the health response, we have seen the ingenuity of Kiwis who have understood what was needed to operate at Level 3 safely, and have made it work. Even more pleasing, is how well these owners and operators have been supported, with Kiwis being mindful of the people and livelihoods that sit behind a meal, a parcel, a takeaway lunch. Those businesses reopened their doors, and we have begun reopening our economy. Now we find ourselves in a unique position again. On Monday Cabinet will consider the next stage of our response. We will do that with the best evidence and advice we can, with all of the data we have from almost one more full cycle of the virus.We need every number from every single day to get the full set of data and we need of course the view of the Director General of Health. We will make a balanced decision. One that recognises the impact of restrictions, and the huge impact of restrictions on people’s livelihoods but doesn’t risk all of the gains that we have made today. After-all, no one wants a second wave. No one. As restrictions have been relaxed in other countries around the world, the virus has had the opportunity to bounce back. And in some places it has. Ultimately we need to stay in controlSo, the key for us has always been to understand where we are at, at any given time in our battle with COVID, and then make sure we are at the right alert level to put us in the best position to continue beating it. Every alert level therefore has its own battle. And even when you win one, it doesn’t mean that the war is over. So a quick reminder again of the framework we have been using to help us on this journey. As the Alert Level system makes clear, different levels allow different amounts of contact with one another, depending on how bad the spread of COVID-19 is. At Alert Level 4 the aim is to ‘eliminate’ contact with each other, and that is what a full lockdown achieves. At Level 3 – Restrict – there is still a high risk the virus can get out of control and bounce back, so the goal remains to restrict contact with one another as much as possible. At Level 2 – The aim is still to reduce close contact with strangers. It acknowledges that the virus is probably still with us, so we do need to behave differently to prevent it taking off again. It is very unlikely that we have hunted down every single case of COVID-19. If stray cases start new chains of transmission we might not find them for a month. So we all have to stay on guard.Level 2 has been designed to get as many people back to work as possible and the economy back up and running but in the safest way possible.In a nutshell, the principle behind Level 2, is play it safe. We will only move there if things are under control, but it won’t mean the fight is over. If we adopt a safer way of operating as part of our new normal, we can keep it in check and remain on our path of elimination. So, now for the principles of playing it safe. First, we have our constants. Public health measures remain unchanged. If you are even slightly sick, stay home. I know this is against New Zealander’s stoic intuition, but I cannot reiterate this enough, if you are sick, please stay at home. If you have symptoms, even if it’s just a runny nose, a sore throat, get a test.And now more than ever, wash your hands, often and properly, all of the time. Wash all high-touch surfaces regularly, like your keys and door handles. And don’t pass other people your phone.The border remains unchanged. We will continue to keep our borders closed except to Kiwis. We will continue to isolate Kiwis who come in from overseas in managed hotels away from others. And our elimination strategy remains in place. Test. Contact trace. Isolate. This is our COVID business as usual. There are a few other things we want you to keep the same. And that includes your distance. You’ll hear people talk a lot about how far you should stay apart from others. Let me give you the rationale behind that. If you are sick, then you will sometimes have symptoms that will make you spread your illness – things like coughing. If that’s the case, the safest place for you is at home. But, if someone doesn’t follow those rules, or doesn’t know they are sick, and leaves the house, the safest distance between you and that sick person is 2 metres. So that’s why we use that guideline. Now, as we have moved through the alert levels, you will be coming into contact with more people, in more places. It’s not always easy to keep that much distance between you. So at Alert Level 2, playing it safe means 2 metres from strangers, but in your workplace, or places where you’re around people you know or who we can contact trace later, we can live with less. Because we can find you and we can find them. Let’s talk then about workplaces at Level 2. Businesses can restart for staff and for customers. Services can be provided on customers’ premises, for example in people’s homes. And people who haven’t been into their office spaces can return, but with good hygiene practices in place. But one thing to remember. COVID is still with us. The fewer people we may have to contact trace in a workplace the better. So while you can go back, it is still worth the conversation with your boss whether you have to be there in person. After-all, many businesses may well have experienced the productivity gains of staggered start times, less congestion, and working from home. There’s no reason we should lose what we have learnt.Each business can work out its own situation. There is flexibility there. What is non-negotiable though is key basic hygiene practices.That brings me to those places of work where working from home was never an option. Domestic cleaners, hairdressers, retail stores, cafes, restaurants, hospitality – at Level 2, when we get there, these operations can reopen. But they all must play it safe, and means doing things differently. For retail, that means physical distancing in store for both staff and customers. It means good hygiene practices and regular cleaning of surfaces and those things people touch often.Larger retailers and malls will follow the lead of our supermarkets with measures like limiting the number of people in store to enable enough space for physical distancing.For hairdressers and beauticians, it means wearing appropriate PPE because of the close proximity you have with your customers throughout the day – because we want to protect you, and your clients.  This in an area we where have given specific advice, because it is virtually impossible to do this job without being in close proximity to your clients and having a large number of clients in any single day so this system is to mitigate this risk.And for hospitality, be it a cafe, a restaurant, or a bar, playing it safe means using all of the evidence and advice we have to make rules that work. This means that only those businesses that can apply the three ‘s’ will be able to operate. They are:1) People must be seated. That means you can only have as many people in your venue as you can safely seat, and no one, regardless of venue size, can have more than 100. The reason for this is simple – COVID loves congregations. Crowds of strangers with no physical distancing, and no ability to tell who you were standing near is very very difficult. It is much easier to separate people, keep them physically distanced, and trace them, if we make sure people are seated. This also helps to prevent the spread. Congested bars have already produced a massive cluster in New Zealand and we must avoid another. 2) People must be separated – so there must be social distance in a venue between people and tables. I acknowledge that this may mean for some it is not economical to open but that is up to each venue. 3) Each table must have a single server. At every venue there must be table service, not people going up to counters, as this minimises contact and helps us to trace if we need to. So the three s’s again are seated, separated, and single-server. Finally, as you can imagine, contact tracing will also be key here. We are working on a nationwide technological fix to make it easier for businesses to record who comes into their premises. This is likely to include QR codes but in the meantime manual or basic digital recording will be used, which was being done by venues before we moved up alert levels.  Of course it matters what happens outside the hospitality venue too – as we have seen in recent weeks.  Operators will have a responsibility to manage customer contact outside their venue. If there are lines for instance – people must be separated.  Those who do not comply with these guidelines will be shut down and lose their ability to operate.  As you can see, there are significant risks in hospitality, and so there are significant rules to manage those risks. These are all principles we have worked through with the Hospitality Association, including the three S’s and we both believe they can be made to work.That brings me to the issue of gatherings. Our journey in understanding this virus has also led us to reaffirm that at Level 2, indoor gatherings are limited to a maximum of 100. I do just want to just acknowledge – that is a maximum, of course many venues for their fire regulations will not be able to have that many and many will not be able to sit that many, and some can’t due to physical venue size but we have also learned enough, to also limit outdoor gatherings to 100 people also. Previously you’ll recall it was 500 for outdoors but I think everyone can see that big events lead to risk, and that risk can mean big clusters. I know this will affect many, but we have to keep working on getting things right so that we can get to a place where larger events are possible again. In the meantime, we are thinking about the extra support required for sectors that are impacted by this. For managed events like weddings, music events, religious services, funerals – these can be held at Level 2 when we get there but with all the same public health guidance, and with the 100-person limit. Public venues such as museums and markets can also open again, but again, the same rules of keeping your distance, and good hygiene apply. Success or failure could depend on something as simple as how often you clean the handrails.This brings me to issue of bubbles.First you no longer need to stick to your bubble.  You can begin seeing family and friends again. But, we do want you to hang onto the same principles we are using general in hospitality. Space, hygiene, and contact tracing. If we have large scale events held in people’s homes, then all of that becomes harder. That is why at alert level two, we are saying that you can have friends and family over to your home, but keep numbers small so that you can practice safe distancing. This is not the time for a large party or function at your home. We will providing more specific guidance on this in the coming days. Personal movementAnd finally, I come to the issue of moving around New Zealand. At the time of creating the alert level framework, our case numbers were limited. We now know a lot about risk. We know for instance, that so long as you play it safe when you travel, we can minimise the risks. It’s what you do when you get there that is the problem. A trip from Wellington to Napier to see your mum is fine. A trip from Wellington to Napier to go to a big conference with an open bar, is not fine. That’s why at Level 2, we will be allowing people to move around the country again, but to do it safely. Keep your distance on public transport, and at airports. Manage your social distancing. Remember the same practices apply wherever you go in the country. And those are practices that those involved in large scale transport are already putting in place.I know this change will mean a lot to the likes of our tourism industry, and I know a lot of people are keen to support you. In fact I got an email just last night from a wonderful Kiwi named Judith who told me that “when we are on the other side of this, I plan to get a haircut then to take a trip somewhere in New Zealand.”A lot of Kiwis share this sentiment but we need to support our tourism industry safely to avoid going back to square one.That brings me to recreation and sport. It’s quite different at Level 2.At Level 2, playgrounds, gyms, pools and public courts are permitted to reopen, subject to meeting the required public health measures.  All water activities, including sailing and motorised boating can resume.Some community sports will be able to return to play more quickly than others while the necessary health requirements are worked through, so we ask that you give your club a chance to get up and running again. We all want to get back to sport, but we want to take enough time to do it safely.Professional sport will be able to resume domestically under Level 2 with the necessary public health measures in place. Super Rugby and the Netball Premiership League have already confirmed their intention to resume a domestic competition at Alert Level 2 which I know will be cause for great excitement for many. The rules around mass gatherings will still apply, so there won’t be any stadium crowds for now. But sport will be played. Again there is more detail to come on this area and it will be made publicly available.And last but not least, education.Early learning services, schools and tertiary education facilities can open at Level 2.I do want to emphasise that, with so few cases in New Zealand, schools and early learning services are safe environments for children, young people and staff. Additional public health control measures are in place to prevent the spread of disease and to support contact tracing. Schools and early learning services will engage with parents about children returning at Level 2.Distance learning is available for those unable to attend school, for example those who are self-isolating, because of potential contact with Covid.Tertiary education facilities too will maintain the core capability to deliver comprehensive distance learning to students if needed. If an education facility has a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19, they must close on an individual or group basis for 72 hours, to allow contact tracing, and then potentially for a further 14 days if required.We also agreed that when we make the decision to move levels, schools won’t be opened midweek – whenever the decision is made – they will open at the beginning of the following week. The same public health messages continue to apply to schools; keep children at home if they’re even slightly sick, and good hygiene such as hand washing are very important.Where possible physical distancing is a good precaution. We do, however, know it is near impossible in an early learning environment and challenging in schools. So staying home if sick, good hygiene practices and regular cleaning become even more important here.And all schools and early learning services will collect information about who’s there, so public health can contact people quickly if they needed.We know parents will have lots of questions, but please give schools and early learning centres time to plan and contact you.And again a reminder we’re not moving yet, this is just the frameworkSo that I hope gives you a good sense of the rationale and principles of Level 2. The place where we are still limiting contact with strangers, and playing it safe.As you can see, it is a large step from where we are now. So my last message is an important one. When it comes the time to move, we want to move with confidence. That means the Ministry of Health and experts giving us the best advice on how to do that.If that advice is to move in a phased way because Level 2 taken all at once has too many risks, because for instance it includes gatherings of people, I would rather take that advice and move out slowly than be in Level 3 longer than we need to. And equally, no one wants to make a decision that leads to us yo-yoing between levels.Now again, no decisions have been made. The Director General has not provided us with advice yet on what decision we should take on Monday. We wait for all of the data to do that.  But if reducing risk means taking several steps into Level 2 rather than one big one, that may be what happens. But we all need to wait, and make that call when the time comes. And finally, a reminder to stick to the plan.I know it’s Mother’s Day this weekend, and the urge to reach out will be strong, but we remain at Level 3, and so if your mum is not in your bubble, then reach out over the phone, or video, send a wee local present and make plans to catch up when it’s safe to do so. There will no doubt be additional questions beyond the broad overview I have given today. Details are available at the COVID website, including examples for different workplaces. We have tried to provide as much as we can, and we’ve tried to work alongside industry and industry associations to provide guidance, but we cannot necessarily provide every answer. We have given ourselves time though, so if you’re a business in particular, and you need a question answered, please do reach out to MBIE for further information.Ultimately, Level 2 is our safer normal. Not a return to business as usual. Treasury modelling has told us that we are better off in the longer term to move down through alert levels progressively and not yo-yo, so that does mean getting every stage right. That means both the decision to go there, but also what we do when we get there. If we think of ourselves as halfway down Everest, I think it’s clear no one wants to hike back up that peak.The descent is known to be even more dangerous, and so we need to proceed with caution, with the highest degree of confidence, and to look after one another on the way.I absolutely believe we can do that.I’m now happy to take your questions."

I know it must have been difficult pulling together an event in circumstances such as these, not least because your guest speaker is in a different part of town than you are. But in this Zoom era, we are nothing if not flexible.One week from today I will be in a different part of this building, delivering Budget 2020. It will be of no surprise to you that it will not be the Budget I thought I would be delivering if you had asked me only a couple of months ago.It is a Budget delivered in the shadow of 1-in-100 year shock to our society and economy. The sweeping global health crisis has left almost every country in the world facing a devastating death toll, health systems under strain, and economies that have all but ground to a halt, with millions around the world losing their jobs and businesses.So, it is far from business as usual. In most years the Budget represents the end of a process that began six months before, the sum total of the Government’s economic action plan for the year ahead. That is one clear difference. The Budget this year is just one staging post in our fight against, and recovery from, COVID-19.  Our response to COVID-19 has been characterised by swift, regular and pragmatic actions. This will continue. The Budget next week will set our direction for the next stages of responding and rebuilding. But COVID-19 requires far more than that. It is a tricky virus, one that keeps moving. Its impact is only just beginning to be felt in our economy.Our economic response to COVID-19 has to happen every day, not just on Budget Day. Just as businesses and workers are fighting every day to secure their futures, so we will keep fighting to protect lives and livelihoods. Every day, supporting New Zealanders to get through and to rebuild stronger and better.  Our plan in the face of COVID 19 is simple:RespondRecover Rebuild1. Respond: Go Hard, Go EarlyOur purpose is clear: to fight the virus, to keep people in work and to support those in need.I’ve said from the start of our response to this crisis that the best economic response is a health response – the two are closely connected. Our best chance to get our economy back up and running and get people back to work is to stay the course. As any good tradie would say, do it once and do it right.  We can look all around the world at the devastation of the exponential curve of cases and deaths and see the prospects of social and economic restrictions for many, many months to know what that could do for our economy. And we can celebrate our success so far in fighting the virus.Let’s not forget that New Zealand confirmed its first case of the virus on the 28th of February, when global cases outside China numbered just 5,000. From that day on, global cases rose to 782,000 by the end of March, and to 3.3 million by the end of April.We were rapidly faced with a choice between a public health catastrophe, as has been seen in other countries, or unprecedented and difficult measures. As part our first support package released on the 17th of March we provided half a billion dollars to ensure our health response was up to speed. And, touch wood, thanks to the commitment of all 5 million New Zealanders, we have been successful in our initial fight against the virus. I know this success has come at a price. The Level 4 and Level 3 restrictions have meant hundreds of thousands of Kiwi workers have had to stay home. We are acutely aware of the stress this has caused to businesses and households, and the sacrifices they have had to make.There are no costless decisions in this situation, nor is there any playbook to go by. But had we not escalated to Alert Level 4, the effects on business and the economy could have been far worse. By going hard and early – and getting on top of the virus – we have maximised our chances of getting things moving faster than many other economies which could be seriously crippled for months or years.That’s why our economic response has matched our public health efforts by going hard and early. On March 17, a week before we went into lockdown, we announced an unprecedented $12.1 billion package to support businesses, jobs and incomes. This included the wage subsidy scheme, income support package for low income New Zealanders, business tax changes, and the aviation support package.Since then, the wage subsidy has paid out more than $10.6 billion to support 1.7 million employees. I have seen some criticism of the scheme, and given the circumstances of its birth it was never going to be perfect. But I stand by our approach. Unlike many countries, we got money into the pockets of Kiwis right away, kept them in work and supported the businesses who urgently needed it. I know that we saved jobs by this action. We always said that there would be transparency about who got funded, and consequences for those who abused the scheme. We’ve implemented enforcement measures, with MSD’s audits requiring dozens of firms to return funds they were not eligible for.We have also been agile and prepared to shift to account for the unfolding situation. Since the package was announced on March 17, we’ve made adjustments to the wage subsidy and also implemented the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme and further small business support including the loss carry-back tax refund initiative.I want to emphasise that from the outset we have worked alongside businesses in the development of this initial response. Their input at every stage of the process has been invaluable. Rob Fyfe and his fellow business leaders have leveraged their resources and networks to provide critical assistance to the All-of-Government response.Business New Zealand, Retail NZ, the CTU and other sector groups have advocated hard for their members, providing useful insights and advice, and I want to thank them for that.The retail banks have worked constructively with the Government and the Reserve Bank to assist the worst-affected businesses and households.One example of this collaboration that has not had the attention it might is the work to keep vital links going for our exporters. With flights being grounded, we knew we had to act. We have put in place a $330 million scheme to restore vital international air freight capacity, with 56 additional weekly cargo flights from New Zealand, and more to come. This scheme is market-led; funding is provided to guarantee cargo on key routes under agreements with the carriers. Carriers then offer that capacity directly to freight customers on commercial terms.Our exporters are continuing to do well in trying circumstances. Statistics out last week showed that overall primary sector export revenue between 1 February and 22 April remains higher than for the same period in 2018. Apples and kiwifruit are performing strongly, while dairy and meat are holding their own.Our strong exports and commitment to trading fairly and freely with the world will be a big part of our recovery and rebuilding. While there are things to celebrate, make no mistake that this global pandemic and the resulting economic damage will be felt acutely here. As we have said from the beginning, we know that we won't be able to save every job and every business, but we are doing everything we can to cushion the blow.Taken together, the commitments announced in the first stage of our economic response represent over $20 billion in support from the Government to help businesses and households weather the initial shock.2. Recover – Back to WorkAs we move forward from our immediate response, our purpose is to see people back at work, to clear the pathway back for communities and sectors most affected by COVID 19, and to lay the foundations for our rebuild.The move into Level 3 saw the very beginning of recovery, with around 400,000 people back at work as more parts of our economy opened up including forestry, construction, manufacturing, and online retail. Next week, Cabinet will decide on moving to Alert Level 2. A move to Level 2 will see the vast majority of our businesses and workers back at it.With more options available for consumers to spend, the Government’s ability to stimulate the wider economy is greatly increased, as is the effectiveness of more targeted support measures.This was reflected in the Small Business Loan Scheme announced last Friday. It will deliver up to $100,000 to small businesses to meet fixed costs. It’s a scheme that reflects a targeted and balanced approach to recovery for viable businesses. Our recovery will continue with interventions to sustain households and businesses and get people working, in combination with sector-specific support to help boost wider economic confidence, and regenerate some of the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic. We have already supported early hit industries like forestry, tourism and the media. Budget 2020 will carry on this work.Continuing our collaborative approach, the support packages for sectors are being designed in consultation with industry leadership. Support will naturally become more targeted, as some industries and firms are able to survive and recover on the back of broader stimulus measures.Our response goes far beyond direct financial support. Making it easier for activity to get going again will speed the recovery and get the economy back on its feet faster. That’s why we’re making the regulatory and legislative changes necessary to help speed up the recovery through this period. One important example is the changes to the Resource Management Act announced by Environment Minister David Parker. These will enable fast-track consenting to get job-rich projects like core infrastructure, housing, and environmental restoration moving quickly. 3. Rebuild BetterOur purpose in rebuilding is to grow jobs that pay well, to support businesses and communities who will sustain our future, and to come back stronger as a country. In the midst of the crisis and our desire to return to a sense of normality, we should all acknowledge that things weren’t perfect before COVID-19 hit us. Let’s be up front about that. While many of our economic indicators were strong – low debt, low unemployment, rising wages and government surpluses – there were ways in which we had not reached the standards we aspire to as a country. Too many children were growing up without the basics, housing has been too expensive, many of our waterways are still not swimmable, our emissions have been rising, people are working harder but don’t feel they are getting ahead. In other words, we are not quite the nation we like to think we are.There are few times in life when the clock is reset. Now is the time we should address these long-term issues. It is a privilege many countries won’t have. It’s not one we should squander. As someone said to me the other day, if your house were to burn down, you probably wouldn’t build it back exactly the same, would you?Budget 2020 gives us the chance to begin this rebuild, better and together. Some significant long-term issues are now right in front of us.The Future of Work has arrived, even if not how we expected. Enabling businesses to grow in a digital age, to trade with a country they might not be able to even visit and to sell new added-value products to the world is essential.Equipping workers with new skills, training opportunities and apprenticeships, and breaking down the digital divide for our workers and families is more critical than ever. We will build the infrastructure we need to unclog our cities, to connect our towns, and support sustainable development. We began this with our $12 billion New Zealand Upgrade Programme announced in January. We look forward to seeing the proposals generated by the private sector, local government and more in the coming weeks.The opportunity is there to break our housing shortage once and for all, and give New Zealanders the shot at the Kiwi dream they have been denied.In short, in the wake of this dreadful and devastating crisis we have a shot at making things better. And we will take it.Budget 2020So this year’s Budget will continue our response, recovery and rebuilding. It is, as I said at the start of the speech, different to what we had intended. As we have faced up to COVID-19, and deployed such significant support in such a short space of time, we took another look at our plans as a Government. Just as will have been the case for countless businesses, important work has had to be slowed or postponed, and resources have had to be reprioritised in light of the fight against COVID-19.The Budget is no exception. The new spending packages planned on our five priorities that were announced in the Budget Policy Statement have been re-assessed. Unless they are meeting a core cost pressure, we have put them on ice. We may revisit them in future, but the focus for Budget 2020 has now very quickly become providing the strong public services we need and taking our next steps to recover and rebuild.  I want to be clear that there will be further support for the recovery and rebuild after Budget Day. As I said earlier, we have to keep working every day to get through this together and to thrive again. To recall an earlier politician’s words, Budget 2020 is part of a rolling maul of support.Our work is still guided by the wellbeing approach, ensuring we balance the needs of our economy, our people, our environment and our communities.  These principles are more important than ever in getting our response to COVID-19 right.New Zealand’s ability to respond strongly to COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of investing in and maintaining effective core government services. For example, agencies such as Health, Inland Revenue, MSD, MBIE, MCDEM and the Treasury have all managed to quickly adapt to the rapid pace of the COVID-19 crisis. I know for many of you who accessed the wage subsidy, you would have been astonished with the response time from MSD, having the money paid out within days.The effectiveness of the Government’s response is down to the professionals in these agencies. Strengthening and improving these services is crucial to the ongoing protection of our collective wellbeing.Economic outlookYou will see in the Treasury’s Budget forecasts next week that the path forward to recovery will be challenging. While I cannot go into specifics today, obviously we are no longer talking about growth in the near term, but about the scale and length of the economy’s contraction. Business investment and confidence will take a hit. Unemployment will rise.We will be doing everything in our power to push back on these trends. And we come from a position of strength. Going into this, we have had better economic growth over the past two years than most of our trading partners, unemployment near a ten year low, and wage growth at a ten year high. But we’ve also seen from modelling released previously by the Treasury how much worse the situation could be if we were to keep moving up and down alert levels. The alternative would not only mean more cases of the virus, but also more businesses going under and more jobs lost.While the numbers we will see in the Budget next week are sobering, we must remember that we’ve moved decisively on the health front to stamp out the virus, giving us more options in terms of getting the economy moving again. This happens faster if our trajectory out of restrictions is smooth and safe.The global economy is of course also taking a serious hit. The IMF is forecasting that global growth will reduce by 3% in 2020 – worse than the global financial crisis – and that advanced economies will contract by more than 6%. The WTO have said that trade volumes could reduce by up to 32%.  Unemployment growth in countries such as the US and Australia far outstrips what we have experienced. We are not alone in facing up to these challenges, and we will need to build on the excellent relationships we have internationally. This is another area where we can re-imagine our future. Our reputation as being free of corruption, and an easy place to do business (we top the world in both right now) can now be added to our success in fighting the virus. There is opportunity to build that not only into brand New Zealand, but also to our immediate economic approach. The trans-Tasman safe zone is but one example, and further afield with countries such as Singapore we are already making great strides. Fiscal outlookIt is the reality of life that all the support and rebuilding we are doing must be paid for. Fortunately, New Zealand’s fiscal position was strong going into the COVID-19 pandemic. We delivered on our plan to reduce net core Crown debt below 20 per cent of GDP and achieved $13 billion of operating surpluses in our first two years in office.These were conscious choices that did not go unchallenged. But planning for a rainy day was part of the way I was brought up. We all hoped it would not happen but this strong fiscal position now means we are in a much better place to cushion the blow of COVID-19 on New Zealanders than most other countries we compare ourselves to. However, I will not sugar coat what the scale of these investments will mean. We will be running operating deficits for an extended period and allowing net core Crown debt to increase to levels well beyond our previous targets. This is a necessary and responsible move as we fight the virus, reduce the impact on businesses and workers, and rebuild our country. This is what other countries around the world are doing. But they are not starting from our position of strength. The UK started with net debt above 75%, the USA 90%, and Ireland 40%. Many countries are already well over 100% as they respond to the virus. Despite the additional borrowing we will need to undertake, we will remain among the least indebted countries among our peers.I remain committed to managing our books carefully and responsibly. Right now, being responsible means investing our money to support our people, businesses and communities to get through this and to rebuild. In time, we will need to return to a more sustainable fiscal path as we have shown we can. But for now, the rainy day has arrived.ConclusionWe said at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that we would do everything we could to protect our people and our economy, and we are doing that. But we could not have done it without the support and buy-in of all New Zealanders.I know that what we have asked New Zealanders to do in this crisis is huge. As we have all had to make sacrifices in doing our bit to stop the spread, so too the Government will ensure we are all able to benefit from our recovery on the other side. By building off our existing strengths and seizing the opportunities that lie in front of us, we will rebuild our economy and our country to be better than it was before – to be the country we’ve always said we want it to be."
2020-04-29T00:08:09Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Winston Peters                    ,  Foreign Minister commends New Zealand’s COVID-19 international response,"***To be checked against delivery*** Good afternoon –Today, we’d like to discuss New Zealand’s foreign policy response to COVID-19.From the beginning of the outbreak we have engaged in a highly dynamic diplomacy, despite the fact that the crisis is preventing Foreign Ministers from meeting face-to-face.As Foreign Minister, calls have taken place with 23 colleagues from around the globe. From the very first call with China’s Wang Yi to the latest with Prime Minister Marape from PNG, we’ve grappled with complex issues around border control, repatriation, and we’ve shared COVID-19 experiences.This dynamic diplomacy has been premised on the idea that no single country has a monopoly on wisdom, and we can make New Zealanders safer by learning from the experience of others.We are also witnessing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s largest and most important consular operation in its storied 77-year history. Here in New Zealand, more than 400 MFAT staff were mobilised, working three shifts to provide a 24/7 emergency response service focused on helping New Zealanders spread across 150 countries. And our almost 60 Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Consuls-General around the world have as their number one task leading their teams to help our citizens stranded offshore.It is also the most complex consular response a New Zealand Government has ever attempted – because rules around lockdowns, border crossings, transits and flight links were and are changing every minute of every day.To give you a sense of its magnitude, during an average three-month period last year, the Ministry managed around 700 consular cases. This year, in the three months since 27 January, MFAT’s Wellington Consular Call Centre has received over 11,000 enquiries; and provided consular support or advice to more than 4,500 New Zealanders in about 150 countries and territories. On behalf of the Coalition Government, and as responsible Minister, we extend our thanks to Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade Chris Seed and his team of dedicated diplomats, consular officials and other professionals working on behalf of their country. We are very proud of your performance.We acknowledge criticisms of the government’s efforts from individual citizens caught in difficult situations offshore, and by the media on their behalf. That is natural but sometimes the anecdotal can shade the larger response effort.So, today offers an opportunity to explain the foreign policy dimension to choices the government has made in its COVID-19 response.One criticism is that we should have closed our border sooner, that we did too little too late. Another criticism was that the government’s response has been too myopic and captured by advice from the Ministry of Health. Both critiques could not be further from the truth.We went hard and we went early. International comparisons show that New Zealand was extremely unusual in closing its borders to foreigners and in implementing a lockdown before we lost a single person to COVID-19. Very few other countries did that.More generally, we were faster than countries we generally compare ourselves with, to:Require self-isolation by international arrivals, 17 days after the first Covid-19 case was confirmed;Close our borders to foreign nationals, 20 days after the first confirmed case, and;Impose a lockdown, 26 days after our first case. These decisions were neither straightforward nor without debate. Indeed, the Ministry of Health recommended a total shutdown of the border, including to returning New Zealanders. From its health perspective this was understandable and appropriate advice. But the Coalition Cabinet rejected that advice because it was and is inconceivable that we will ever turn our backs on our own. So, on March 17, New Zealanders were urged to come home while commercial options remained available. We built from scratch managed isolation and quarantine systems to mitigate against the heightened health risk posed by returning New Zealanders.  It was the right thing to do. Around 80,000 New Zealanders have so far answered that call and travelled home since 14 March. Many thousands of those returning were assisted by MFAT. This assistance has ranged from chartering planes to fly stranded New Zealanders home; getting Kiwis on to repatriation flights run by our partners, including Australia, Singapore and the United Kingdom; smoothing transit issues; and providing advice about travel options. The managed exit of foreign citizens stranded here was another complex decision. The domestic movement of thousands of people risked our national health goals.But one of the underpinnings of relations between nations is reciprocity. That is, we expect other countries to help return our people to New Zealand – so it would be wrong and dangerous to prevent foreign nationals from leaving here.Cabinet rightly decided that, despite advice raising risks about the potential negative health consequences of such a decision, we needed to safely manage the exit of foreign nationals. So we did.Around 45,000 foreign nationals departed our shores during the Level 4 lockdown.Through these experiences we have built an effective delivery system for people safely entering and exiting the country, now and into the future.Notwithstanding the ongoing massive consular effort, MFAT was also tasked three weeks ago with considering our post-COVID foreign policy priorities – and how we could use our foreign policy to support the domestic recovery and trade recovery that are starting to get underway.Along with Minister of Trade David Parker, we’ll soon be discussing with our Cabinet colleagues how New Zealand positions itself in the new normal that emerges post this COVID crisis.How we adapt internationally, how quickly, and how effectively, is crucial in promoting the peace and prosperity of New Zealand, and its regions, as it recovers from the massive disruption of COVID-19.Thank you.ENDS"
2020-04-20T04:13:13Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  Prime Minister’s remarks on COVID-19 alert level decision – April 20,"Tēnā koutou katoaOver the past few weeks I have often used my time at this podium to acknowledge the people on the frontline. Today I want to remember the people in New Zealand who have lost someone to COVID-19, or the many more who had the terror of almost losing someone.Throughout this pandemic there have been individuals who I have tracked the progress of. I didn’t know their names, but I knew their status. And I still get a phone call for every individual person we lose to COVID-19. We may be amongst a small number of countries where that is still able to happen, where the numbers we have lost have been small, but we cannot forget that every number is someone’s father, someone’s mum, a relative and a friend and someone we have all been united in an effort to protect and to save.And that is why we as a country took on the challenge of staring down COVID-19 – because we believed that decisive action, going hard and going early, gave us the very best chance of stamping out the virus. And it has. We have done what very few countries have been able to do. We have stopped a wave of devastation. Our transmission rate, the number of cases each person with the virus passes it onto, is now 0.48, less than half a person each. Overseas the average is 2.5 people. We have amongst the lowest number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the world. We have a relatively low proportion of serious cases and, according to the Oxford University Coronavirus Government Response Tracker, one of the lowest mortality rates in the world. Nearly every case identified since April 1 is as a result of overseas travel or contact with someone with the virus, often in existing clusters. The number of individual cases that don’t have an obvious connection in that period stands now at only 8. Our testing has scaled up and we have now tested over 85,000 New Zealanders, one of the highest testing rates per capita in the world. In the last few days, we expanded testing to include random testing in Queenstown, the Waikato, Canterbury and Auckland. We have tested over a thousand people this way and so far have produced not a single positive result. The Director General of Health is confident that there is currently no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. In short, the effort of our team of 5 million has broken the chain of transmission and taken a quantum leap forward in our goal to eliminate the virus. Elimination doesn’t mean zero cases, it means zero tolerance for cases. It means when a case emerges, and it will, we test, we contact trace, we isolate, and we do that every single time with the ambition that when we see COVID-19, we eliminate it. That is how we will keep our transmission rate under 1, and it is how we will keep succeeding. And we have seen success. You, all of you, have stopped the uncontrolled explosion of COVID-19 in New Zealand, and I couldn’t feel prouder of the start we have made together. But I also feel a huge responsibility to ensure that we do not lose any of the gains we have made either. On that basis, New Zealand will move out of Alert Level 4 lockdown at 11.59pm on Monday April 27, one week from today.  We will then hold in Alert Level 3 for two weeks, before reviewing how we are tracking again, and making further decisions at Cabinet on the 11th of May. In making this decision, Cabinet discussed in depth all of the data we have shared with you daily. We looked at the gains we have made in our results, but also our systems. We considered that the longer we are in lockdown, the less likely it is we will need to go back. We also considered moving alert levels on the 23rd of April, in just 48 hours’ time.  The sacrifice made to date has been huge. And Cabinet wanted to make sure we lock in our gains, and give ourselves some additional certainty. Waiting to move to alert levels next week costs us two more business days, but gives us much greater longer term health and economic returns down the track. It means we are less likely to go backwards.Ultimately, we have taken a balanced approach, and one that the Director General of Health not only supported, but also recommended. This time we now have will be used to prepare, on all fronts. This week businesses will be allowed to get ready to open, such as employers re-entering premises to receive stock if necessary, but we ask that in doing so they stick to social distancing and their bubbles. The same principle applies for preparing schools. Schools and early learning centres can be accessed this week for cleaning, maintenance and any other preparations. The current plan is for schools to be able to re-open for a Teacher Only Day on 28 April as part of their preparation, and we expect those who need to attend, to be able to from 29 April. It may take a bit longer for some schools and early learning centres to be ready.And from a health perspective, testing will continue including giving ongoing public confidence that we are reaching isolated, rural, maōri and pacific communities, contact tracing will be bolstered even further, and we will continue to use the best evidence, advice and modelling we have to make daily decisions to serve New Zealanders. The most important thing to remember in the meantime though, is that all of this preparation takes us to an alert level in one week’s time – a recovery room of sorts – that has many restrictions. Yes Alert Level 3 allows more economic activity like construction, manufacturing and forestry, but it does not allow more social activity. And for good reason. If we want to make sure that we are a health success story, and ensure our economy can start to operate again without the virus taking off, we need to get the next phase right. The worst thing we can do for our country is to yo-yo between levels, with all of the uncertainty that this would bring. We need to move with confidence. And that means following the rules.So here’s a reminder of the principles for Level 3 when we get there.  Stay home. If you are not at work, school, exercising or getting essentials, then you must be at home, the same as at Level 4.   Work and learn from home if you can. We still want the vast majority of people working from home, and children and young people learning from home. At-risk students and staff should also stay at home, and they will be supported to do so. Early learning centres and schools will physically be open for up to Year 10 for families that need them.  Make your business COVID-19 safe. COVID-19 has spread in workplaces, so the quid pro quo of being able to open is doing it in a way that doesn’t spread the virus. Important industries like construction, manufacturing and forestry will be able to open, as will retail so long as it is contactless retail.   Stay regional. You can exercise at parks or beaches within your region, but the closer to home the better. Activities must be safe – keep 2 metres away from anybody not in your bubble. Make minimal trips.   Keep your bubble as small as possible. If you need to, you can expand your bubble a small amount to bring in close family, isolated people or caregivers. <  Wash your hands often with soap. Then dry them. Cough into your elbow.  If you’re sick stay at home and seek advice from your GP or Healthline about getting a test. And quickly. There is no stigma to COVID-19. None. We will only be successful if everyone is willing to play their part in finding it wherever it is.These rules will be so important. We all want to continue to progress down the levels. The best hope of getting back to normal as soon as possible, is never getting ahead of where we are right now. So, to recap. We are currently in lockdown, and are staying there for the next week.   From Tuesday morning the 28th of April we will move to Level 3 and stay there for two weeks. Those two weeks gives us another cycle of transmission to assess how we are doing. From there, we will move if we can and if we’re ready.  But only when we’re ready, and only when it’s safe. And so, this weekend, ANZAC weekend, enjoy the company of your bubble, stay local, and reflect on the amazing sacrifice of our forebears. Decades ago they came together in the most testing of circumstances half a world away and helped forge who we are today. It was a very different battle than the one we are in now, but the character of who we are as a country remains exactly the same.   So please, stay strong, stay home, be kind. And let’s finish what we started.  "
2020-04-15T01:45:30Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Grant Robertson                    ,  Finance Minister Speech to Business New Zealand,"Thank you to Kirk and Business NZ for hosting me again today, and indeed for all your help and input into the Government’s response to the COVID pandemic thus far. The relationship has been extremely beneficial and I look forward to continuing to work together as we move through the lockdown and out the other side.For me, like many New Zealanders I think, the last month has been the most extraordinary of my life. Not least because having spent the last two and a half years as Finance Minister operating a tight fiscal ship, I have approved expenditure of more than $20 billion in three weeks.  Despite the dramatic shift I am convinced it has been the right thing to do.I am not saying for a minute that we have got every single action as a government 100% right but in a fast moving, uncertain and uncharted situation we have been as decisive, clear and compassionate as we possible could be.And it appears to be working. We have turned the corner, or come down from the peak as the Director General of Health said yesterday.  It’s the result of the whānau of five million pulling off a monumental team effort.  I recall when we were getting ready to move to Alert Level Four someone saying to me that they did not think New Zealanders had the discipline or the temperament to deal with a lockdown, as compared with countries who were seemingly having some success with these sorts of measures.Well, New Zealanders have well and truly proved that wrong.  I actually don’t think it’s about discipline so much as our innate sense of loyalty to one another and pride in our country to beat any enemy who comes our way.And to carry that thought on - that’s why as I said to the PM, we can’t squander a good halftime lead by getting complacent. We will stay the course, break the chain, control the virus and come out the other side, ready to build our nation again.Of all the things we have done, the wage subsidy scheme has been one of the most extraordinary aspects of an extraordinary time. In just over three weeks more than $9 billion has been paid out to support nearly 1.5 million employees. And actually paid out too. While some may argue that schemes being put in place overseas are more generous, ours has paid out. No money will be paid across the Tasman from their scheme until May. In the UK it is just about to start- but only for furloughed workers.The Wage Subsidy Scheme has as its core principle keeping people attached to their jobs. Giving business and households the cashflow and confidence to look to the future, uncertain as it is.In some senses for me this draws together the threads of one of my driving forces for being in politics. My fundamental belief in the dignity and importance of decent work. Many of you know that the project that gave me the greatest satisfaction in opposition was The Future of Work Commission. It was both about how we make sure there is decent work and higher wages in our future, but also working differently, drawing together business, unions, academics, entrepreneurs and more to develop ideas and solutions.Well now the Future of Work has arrived, and it looks a bit different than I imagined, but it is the challenge I have been waiting for, and one I want to work with you on making the best of for our people.What I want to do today is further fill out the detail our plan for the response and recovery from COVID19, through the first wave of the immediate response, to the second wave of kickstarting the economy and the third wave where we reset and rebuild our nation from this once in a century shock.I also want to spend a little bit of time on the economic context, and the topic on so many people’s minds - what our exit from Level 4 and moves through Level 3 and Level 2 look and feels like.Our Plan to Respond and RecoverWave One: Fight The Virus and Cushion the BlowFrom the outset we have acted decisively to contain the virus and avoid the extreme human and economic costs of an uncontrolled outbreak.That’s why this is first and foremost a health response - because the best protection for the economy is to stop the spread and eliminate the virus from New Zealand.In doing so, we have applied three key principles to our economic approach: First to act swiftly with no regrets. Second to improve cashflow and confidence. Third to act in coordination to secure and support our financial and business sector.Our response has already seen unprecedented support rapidly deployed by the Government. Our initial $12 billion package included an initial $500 million boost for health, wage subsidies for affected businesses in all sectors and regions, a $2.8 billion income support package for our most vulnerable, a $100 million worker redeployment package, $2.8 billion in business tax changes to free up cashflow encourage investment, and support working from home, and a $600 million aviation support package.But in acting swiftly, we have been prepared to shift our response as conditions change or new information comes to light. We have continued to add to and modify the range of policies aimed at cushioning the blow of COVID-19 on New Zealanders.We’ve put together the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme, alongside the Reserve Bank and retail banks. The Scheme is designed to help enable banks to provide credit to customers where otherwise the bank may not be willing to do so.Nine banks have signed up to participate in the scheme including ANZ, ASB, BNZ, Heartland Bank, HSBC, Kiwibank, SBS Bank, TSB and Westpac. Over the weekend I signed the deed, executing the agreement between the Crown and the banks, with some banks now able to deliver on the scheme as of yesterday.We’ve also recently announced changes to the Companies Act to help companies facing insolvency remain viable.These changes include giving directors of companies a ‘safe harbour’ from insolvency duties under the Companies Act, enabling businesses to place existing debts into hibernation, allowing the use of electronic signatures, and giving temporary relief for entities that are unable to comply with requirements in their constitutions or rules because of COVID-19.In addition to these changes, this morning we announced a suite of further support measures for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises.Our tax loss carry-back scheme will allow a large number of businesses to access their previous tax payments as cash refunds, at an estimated benefit of $3.1 billion.We are bringing forward the tax loss continuity rules to make it easier for firms to raise new capital without losing the tax benefit of their existing losses. This is a useful initiative particularly for start-up companies. We also know that some businesses are struggling to meet their non-wage fixed costs, like interest, rent and insurance, but are not currently in a position to take on additional debt.That’s why we’re providing greater flexibility for businesses to meet their tax obligations, which should provide cashflow relief, as well as providing tailored support services to help businesses weather the storm, at no charge to the business.Using established services including the Regional Business Partner Network and the helplines run by the Employers and Manufacturers Association and Canterbury Chamber of Commerce, we are providing $25 million to fund specialist, tailored advice to where it is needed, fast. We have been getting clear feedback that particularly small and medium enterprises are asking for support on business continuity.We have also introduced measures to support commercial tenants and landlords. Many businesses may be finding it difficult or impossible to pay rent if they are no longer able to access their property, and if landlords are not receiving rent, they may not be able to meet their mortgage obligations.As a result, the Government will extend the current 10 working day timeframe that commercial landlords may cancel the lease to 30 working days. This will be for both the period the tenant is in arrears before the notice is given, and for the period to remedy the breach.The Government will also extend the timeframes for lenders from 20 to 40 working days for mortgaged land, and from 10 to 20 working days for mortgaged goods. These measures will support an orderly process to deal with commercial lease disputes caused by COVID-19.These changes will require legislation, however we have announced these decisions early to give businesses certainty, and will be asking Parliament to agree to make some of these changes retrospective.Wave Two: Kickstarting the EconomyOur response is not about distinct phases that follow one after the other.  They are waves that are all under way at once, lapping over and under each other. Much of the work we have done and continue to do on the first phase – cushioning the blow and fighting the virus - will continue in the coming months.We are also actively working on what comes after the Wage Subsidy Scheme, assessing what further backing businesses and households need as we further understand the impact of COVID 19, alongside further support for the health system. The guidance we are releasing on Thursday for coming out of Level 4 will give businesses and workers a much better idea of what the more medium-term picture looks like for them, for the economy, and for society.But we also have an obligation to work together now to prepare to kick start the economy as we move down the alert levels. Our way of working has to continue to be collaborative and decisive.We have a range of workstreams well underway aimed at the medium term positioning for recovery.  I will mention some critical ones today.We have established the Economically Significant Business Group inside the Treasury to guide our work with New Zealand’s major businesses.  We have brought in outside commercial expertise to support this, and have begun conversations with a range of network critical businesses.  There are a variety of options available should the Government need to support businesses that are essential to our recovery and our supply chains.  We showed with our $900 million package for Air New Zealand what we can do. Phil Twyford and Shane Jones have tasked the Infrastructure Industry Reference Group to prepare a list of infrastructure projects and programmes from across central and local government, and the private sector, that are shovelready. These could be deployed as part of a stimulatory package as soon as the construction industry returns to normal.The Reference Group is headed by the Chair of Crown Infrastructure Partners, Mark Binns.  It is supported by the work David Parker is doing in terms of changes to the RMA and consenting process to move things forward as quickly as possible.Phil Twyford and Shane Jones have also continued to work on redeployment support, especially in our regions and they will have more announcements to make about that in the near future.  Megan Woods as Housing Minister is working to bring forward projects that will drive not only jobs, but also deal with our long term housing issues.  I have asked Chris Hipkins to lead the work on the critical training and employment support programme that has to take place from here.  Thousands of New Zealanders are going to need to retrain, gain new skills and support the kickstarting of our economy.  This work is in partnership with business, with unions and with training providers. The Prime Minister, drawing on advice from her Business Advisory Group, has called for the creation of the world’s smartest border.  Using technology and our ‘natural moat’ as she calls it, to give us not just protection against the virus but a window to a future where we can move people and goods safely again.Winston Peters and David Parker are charting a new course for trade and diplomacy in a radically changed world.  We need to continue to trade, and look again at our relationships to see how we can leverage our natural advantages and excellent progress on controlling the virus. In every sector of our economy and society we have a need, and an opportunity, to come through the other side of this with a strong recovery plan. We have tasked all Ministers with reaching out to their sector to help develop these plans. It is important not to see this narrowly. Our ingenuity and innovation will matter as we re-imagine what our arts and music scenes look like in an era of physical distancing, as much as in other sectors of the economy. As we move towards the Budget on the 14th of May we are drawing these recovery plans together to play our part in kickstarting the economy. The Budget will be a Recovery Budget. It will include funding for the cost pressures that are necessary part of keeping our country ticking over.  But we will devote much of our resources to kickstarting this recovery. We will do this through the lens of the intergenerational wellbeing of our people and with the long term adjustments we need to make in our sights. And I know the same thing is happening in businesses around the country.  I have heard the stories of people re-imagining their café or restaurant in a world of physical distancing.  The manufacturers shifting gear to meet needs in the health sector, the exporters altering their supply chains in real time to keep exports going.Supporting that optimism and spirit is essential to making this work. Wave Three:  Reset and Rebuild We must also make this the opportunity to reset our economy, to take account of the massive disruption to some sectors, but also to address some of the long standing challenges we face.  In doing so we also must chart a course to return to a sustainable fiscal position.This work will again require us to develop new ways of working and break down the barriers between partners in our economy.  We have formed a core Ministerial Oversight Group for this work with the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, myself and Minister Parker.  We will soon be reaching out to both Ministerial colleagues but also the private sector, unions and more to have input into this work.We must answer the big questions about our economy in these unprecedented times.  What should we make and do here in New Zealand to ensure our sustainability; what institutions do we need to support our economy; what is the role of the State; how do we trade with the rest of the world in this new environment; and how will the financial system, both here and globally, cope? Climate Change will continue to be a major challenge long after the effects of this pandemic have been mitigated. As Rod Carr raised yesterday, our economic recovery needs to be one where emissions continue to reduce and more sustainable technologies are invested in and taken up.New Zealand has had a long-run problem of low productivity. We need to look at our uptake of new technology and new ways of working to ensure that this problem does not again become baked into the New Zealand economy through our recovery.Underpinning all of this, as the Prime Minister said yesterday we must also not allow inequality to take hold in our recovery. In fact we need to take this opportunity to improve the prospects of all New Zealanders and tackle those long standing divisions.We’ve seen through this virus what happens when sectors and industries are overly reliant on certain markets for their export revenue. New Zealand must always remain a trading nation, but we will need to look at greater diversification of our export markets to make sure we are prepared for any future shocks to trade networks.The importance of the role of the state has been underlined by this crisis. I hold a strong personal belief in the power of the state to do good. It is through a well-funded, highly functional public service, that we have had the ability to coordinate and provide leadership for New Zealanders, guiding both the public health response and the economic response to this crisis.I believe it is of the utmost importance that the state continues to play an active part in the economic recovery, providing leadership and direction as we move forward through the challenging times ahead.Finally, I know that what we have asked New Zealanders to do in this crisis is huge. As we have all had to make sacrifices in doing our bit to stop the spread of the virus, so too will we all have a part to play in our economic recovery. And as we have all made sacrifices, we all should benefit from our collective recovery on the other side.A final note on our way of working in this wave. We recognise the important role that the business community has in supporting this big picture thinking. You will hear more from us soon on how we will look to shape that engagement.Economic context To finish, no doubt you will all be aware of the Prime Minister’s announcement last week that on the 20th of April, two days before the lockdown is due to finish, Cabinet will make a decision on next steps based on the most up to date data that we have.That means, if we are ready to move to Alert Level 3, businesses will have two days to implement arrangements. In order to support that, tomorrow we will release guidance for how businesses could operate under reduced alert levels and what measures need to be taken for them to do so. We are taking lessons from the swift move into Alert Level 4, and aim to give as much clarity in advance as possible. This means developing some basic principles for safe economic activity and then working through that on a sector-by-sector basis, and providing examples to businesses to guide their decisions. We will consult and iterate on these in the development and application.What I can say now is that our emphasis at level 3 moves from “essential” economic activity to “safe” economic activity.I am aware of the work that businesses large and small are doing to change their way of working to operate in as safe a way as possible so we can allow as much activity as possible. The critical questions are: is it possible for your business to have social distancing? Can you build in contact tracing tools or mechanisms to keep track of your supply chain and customers?To be clear, any decision to move out of Level 4 will be made within the context of an elimination strategy for COVID-19. The primary factor that Cabinet will take into consideration is whether the Director-General of Health is confident that the disease is under control. But I can also assure you that Cabinet will consider evidence of the impact of current containment measures on the economy and wider society.The economic modelling released by the Treasury yesterday will help inform this decision, but I would caution that the path the economy takes from here remains extremely uncertain. What this analysis does do is help us weigh up the implications of different fiscal and regulatory policy decisions.The Treasury’s economic scenarios detail how the COVID situation could play out differently for the economy based on the amount of time spent at each Alert Level.These scenarios back our decision to go hard and go early in the fight against COVID-19 because the quicker we stamp it out, the quicker the economy can recover. The longer we waited, the more cases and deaths New Zealand would have had.This also shows the importance of everyone continuing to do the amazing job they are doing to stay home, break the chain and save lives. This is giving our businesses and the economy the best chance to get going again on the other side. "
2020-04-09T01:07:21Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  Prime Minister’s remarks halfway through Alert Level 4 lockdown,"Today is day 15 of Alert Level 4 lockdown. And at the halfway mark I have no hesitation in saying, that what New Zealanders have done over the last two weeks is huge.In the face of the greatest threat to human health we have seen in over a century, Kiwis have quietly and collectively implemented a nationwide wall of defence.You are breaking the chain of transmission. And you did it for each other. As a Government, we may have had pandemic notices. We may have had powers that come with being in a national emergency. But you held the greatest power of all. You made the decision that together, we could protect one other. And you have. You have saved lives.Modelling provided to my office by economist Rodney Jones on the eve of the lockdown suggested New Zealand was on a similar trajectory to potentially Italy and Spain and that our 205 cases on the 25th of March could have grown to over 10,000 by now without the actions we have taken together.And new modelling due to be released later today by Te Punaha Matatini suggests that the current controls at Alert Level 4 have already had a significant impact on new case numbers and we are on track to meet their most optimistic scenario.Instead of the horrific scenes we have seen abroad we are at 1239 cases, and the total number of cases has fallen for the last four days with 29 new cases today, the lowest daily number of cases since the 23rd of March, before the lockdown began.We are turning a corner, and your commitment means our plan is working.But to succeed, we need it to keep working. Success does not mean we change the course. Removing restrictions now would allow the virus to spread rapidly once again and we would be back to the starting line within two weeks. That’s also why we will keep enforcing the rules. In addition you will have seen an increase in police enforcement in recent days, I expect that to continue, including road blocks in some places this Easter weekend. While most people are doing the right thing, some are not. We cannot let the selfish actions of a few set us back. And we won't. Especially after all that everyone has sacrificed to get us here.I have read messages from those who have lost loved ones they couldn’t come together to grieve for, brand new parents whose most joyful time has been made so difficult because of separation. Businesses who are worried for their livelihoods and for the family that are their employees.I am acutely aware of the pain many New Zealanders are feeling.Over 1 million of our fellow citizens are now supported by a wage subsidy, many of whom will be experiencing a cut in income. At the end of March there were already an extra 4,866 Kiwis on a benefit, and last week that number increased by another 10,000. And many businesses are reporting that they may not be able to re-open at the end of the lockdown period.I want to give you all the assurance that I can, that the health and wellbeing of you and our communities has always been on our minds as we have made decisions on COVID-19, but so has your livelihoods. We will continue to stand alongside you.We have made record investments to keep as many businesses as possible afloat and people in jobs. We are doing what we can to cushion the blow and plan for our recovery.But as I’ve said, this is going to be a marathon. Our plan for that marathon, is to keep eliminating the virus from New Zealand. We can do that by keeping it out of the country, but also by rapidly stamping out any outbreaks that flare up. And that plan is the very best thing we can also do for the New Zealand economy. The best economic response continues to be a strong health response.That’s why I am announcing the next stage of initiatives to scale up our health response to put us in the best position possible to exit Level 4 and prepare for Level 3.No matter what level we are at in the future, there are three areas where we need to become water tight. Firstly, our borders must be tightly managed. That’s why from midnight tonight every New Zealander boarding a flight to return home will be required to undergo quarantine or what we have called managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days.I am also signalling that the requirement for 14 days of quarantine or managed self-isolation in a government-approved facility, will be a prerequisite for anyone entering the country in order to keep the virus out.As an island nation we have a distinct advantage in our ability to eliminate the virus, but our borders are also our biggest risk.The Government has gone harder earlier with border measures compared to other countries, but even one person slipping through the cracks and bringing the virus in can see an explosion in cases as we have observed with some of our bigger clusters.The quarantining of returning New Zealanders will be a significant undertaking.For context nearly 40,000 New Zealanders have returned home since the 20th of March, when we closed the border to foreign nationals. That is more than all of the hotel rooms across the country that we could have properly housed people in. There has always been urgency around this matter, but simply put, we could not have done it from the beginning, but we  can and are doing it now. A network of up to 18 hotels will be used to implement this approach, of which one to two will be specifically set aside for those under strict quarantine conditions.The second aspect of our ongoing COVID-19 response is significantly scaled up and faster contact tracing and greater use of technology.The more we improve the speed and effectiveness of our contact tracing, the better placed we will be in breaking the chain of transmission.The Ministry of Health is already working on a locally developed app that will assist with contact tracing.I should caution that it is in the early stages, it will have basic functionality, but even that will be important as it will help update our national health database with users contact details.  Then they will look to add functions. We are investigating the Singaporean Government’s Bluetooth-based app TraceTogether that can record interactions between a phone and any other phones nearby that have the app installed.  It will often pick up phones at a distance so is not perfect.The data is stored on the phone and if the user tests positive they then release the data to the government for contact tracing. Close contacts can then be automatically notified of their need to self-isolate and be tested.Singapore are planning to open source their technology in the next few weeks. We have made initial contact with the Singaporean Government and registered our interest, and I have a phone call with Prime Minister Lee of Singapore this evening where I will be discussing this technology further. I think it’s important to note that these kinds of apps are useful, but don’t solve everything. What’s most important is that you have good people, and enough people, working on contact tracing as quickly as possible. We do, and we continue to improve every day. And finally, this ongoing plan must be underpinned by testing. We already have incredibly high rates of testing compared to others, but we want to be even better. We will be maintaining high levels of testing and supplementing it with additional testing to ensure we have greater levels of certainty around the decline in the viruses' spread.With these three pillars, border controls, rigorous testing and contact tracing,  and making sure we use all the technology available we have what we need to win this marathon. But I know in a race it’s important to have some signposts.  To know where we are, and exactly what we need to do when we get there so we can all plan. Let me set out the timelines then for some key decisions that will affect everyone. Level 4 has come with some heavy restrictions. That has required difficult decisions around services and businesses that can and cannot operate. We need to give similar more detailed guidance on what life at Level 3 looks like, and we will do that next week. That will give us a window to iron out questions and issues, and make sure we’re as prepared as we can be when it comes time to move. It is then my intention that on the 20th of April, two days before the lockdown is due to finish, Cabinet will make a decision on our next steps. That’s because we need to use the most up to date data that we have to make that decision. That means, if we are ready to move to Alert Level 3, business we will have two days to implement arrangements. But let me say again, we will not be moving out of Level 4 early. If we move too early, we will go backwards. In the meantime I ask every business to use the time you have to prepare for what every alert level may mean for you. Treat COVID-19 like a health and safety issue. Ask whether it’s possible for your business to have social distancing? Can you build in contact tracing tools or mechanisms to keep track of your supply train and customers? Help us get ready as a nation for the marathon we must all run together. I know we can do this. And I know that, because we are already. So as we head in to Easter I say thank you to you and your bubble. You have stayed calm, you’ve been strong, you’ve saved lives, and now we need to keep going. "
2020-03-25T01:06:59Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  Prime Minister’s statement on State of National Emergency and Epidemic Notice,"Mr SpeakerI wish to make a Ministerial Statement under Standing Order 347 in relation to the recent declaration of a State of National Emergency.Having considered the advice of the Director Civil Defence Emergency Management, the Minister of Civil Defence declared a State of National Emergency for the whole of New Zealand under section 66 of the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002 on March the 25th 2020 at 12.21pm.This is to manage the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic within New Zealand.The Minister of Civil Defence took this step because of the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic, and because he considered the response required to combat COVID-19 is of such a degree that it will be beyond the capacity of local Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups to respond to on their own.This pandemic also requires a significant and coordinated response by and across central and local government. Also, under section 5 of the Epidemic Preparedness Act 2006, yesterday I issued an Epidemic Notice, nationwide, to help ensure the continuity of essential Government business due to the unprecedented effects of the global pandemic, COVID-19, which is likely to significantly disrupt essential governmental and business activity in New Zealand.This Epidemic Notice came into effect today, the 25th of March 2020, just after midnight and it will remain for three months with ongoing review, and from which, now further Epidemic Management Notices and Epidemic Modification Orders can be given – particularly across local government, immigration and social services – crucial services that now need flexibility to operate due to the effects of an epidemic in our country and an impending lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19.At 11.59pm tonight, we move to the highest Alert Level of 4, and we, as a nation, go into self-isolation.The trigger: early evidence of community transmission of COVID-19 in New Zealand. But unlike so many other gravely inundated countries, we have a window of opportunity to stay home, break the chain of transmission, and save lives. It’s that simple. In this fight against a virus, we have some things on our side. We are moving into this next phase of our response early. Ahead of any potential over-run of our hospitals, and ahead of any deaths on New Zealand soil. But that doesn’t mean we should be complacent. And that’s why we must take this period of self-isolation deadly seriously.This means we will go about life very differently to help slow down the spread of COVID-19. We all have a role to play.Only those in essential services will leave home to go to work. All others stay home and stop interactions with those outside the home.Non-essential business premises close. Events and gatherings are cancelled. Schools close.Public transport is reserved for those undertaking essential services and transport of freight.Domestic air travel is very limited.New Zealanders entering at our borders undergo strict measures to isolate or quarantine.From midnight tonight, we bunker down for four weeks to try and stop the virus in its tracks, to break the chain. Make no mistake this will get worse before it gets better. We will have a lag and cases will increase for the next week or so. Then we’ll begin to know how successful we have been.I am fully aware that we have moved with huge speed. No other country in the world has moved to these measures with no deaths and so few infections. We have 5 people in our hospitals, none in ICUs or needing ventilators at this stage.But we have no time to waste. We could have waited to plan ever intricate detail required to execute this closure, till we could answer every single question or circumstance. But, every hour we wait, is one more person, two more people, three more people, exposed to Covid-19. That is why we did not wait. We established an alert system with clear guidance on when we must act, and why. We asked people to prepare, and then moved decisively.These moves will be enforced. And we will be the enforcer. Yesterday I issued the Epidemic Notice and today the Minister of Civil Defence declared a State of National Emergency, both of which provide us the powers for Government to move the country to Alert Level 4. This is the second time in New Zealand’s history that a State of National Emergency has been declared.The first was on February the 23rd 2011.It followed the 6.3 magnitude earthquake in Christchurch. It followed the death of many New Zealanders, the total destruction of much infrastructure and the crippling of essential services.It was declared to allow the greatest possible coordination of local, national, and international resources to work on rescue and recovery. As the other side of the House would recall well.Today we put in place our country’s second State of National Emergency as we fight a global pandemic, as we fight to save New Zealanders’ lives. To prevent the very worst that we’ve seen in other countries around the world from happening here. To protect our essential health services. To cushion the economic impacts of COVID-19. A State of National Emergency to preserve our way of life.Every person still at work, interacting with others, increases the risk of the virus spreading exponentially and means we will be in lockdown for longer.That means people will be out of work longer, doing further damage to livelihood and lives. There will be no tolerance for that. We will not hesitate to use our enforcement powers if needed.Through the early and hard measures we’ve taken at the border, using the powers under the Health Act, the signing of epidemic notices, now, being in a State of National Emergency, we have all of the legislative means possible, all the enforcement powers, all the tools we need, at our disposal to combat the spread of COVID-19.Under the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002, today’s declaration of a State of National Emergency will allow the Director Civil Defence Emergency Management to direct, coordinate and use the resources made available to manage the response to COVID-19. The Director of Civil Defence Emergency Management may also control the exercise and performance of functions, duties, and powers of Civil Defence Emergency Management Groups and Group Controllers across the country. While in force, it will allow Civil Defence Emergency Management Controllers to provide for the:conservation and supply of food, fuel and other essential suppliesregulate land, water and air trafficto close roads and public placesto evacuate any premises, including any public place, And if necessary to exclude people or vehicles from any premises or place.This declaration helps us limit our exposure, and the exposure of the most vulnerable members of our community, to COVID-19. In short, it will help save lives.An Epidemic Notice further strengthens our response to COVID-19 and helps us manage effectively shutting down the country for the first time.It does a number of things including allowing for special powers of medical officers of health – and immediately unlocks powers under the Corrections, Health and Electoral Acts. But importantly an Epidemic Notice sits as an umbrella over further notices that can now be issued, and which have now been issued, to change and modify specific parts of legislation in a common-sense and pragmatic way to keep our systems working in a time of lockdown – and get rid of particular requirements that are impractical to comply with in a time of an epidemic and when in lockdown.Specifically for our immigration sector: Temporary visas are automatically extended to late September.This comes into effect from Thursday the 2nd of April 2020 and means travellers with a temporary work, student, visitor, interim and limited, visa expiring before 1 April 2020 who are unable to leave New Zealand must apply online for a new visa. An interim visa will be issued.Travellers with a temporary visa due to expire between 1 April and 9 July 2020 will have their visas extended to late September. Confirmation of extensions will be emailed directly to all visa holders.Detailed information is on the Immigration NZ website and covid19.govt.nz website but anyone in New Zealand and concerned about their visa should get in touch with Immigration New Zealand. For our social service sector, an epidemic notice means:The Ministry for Social Development can grant emergency benefits to people who would otherwise not be entitled to them (including temporary workers who lose a job) – this sits as a necessary partner to the Government’s multi-billion dollar economic assistance package that aims to keep people in jobs and with an income – including wage subsidies for all workers working legally in New Zealand and a deployment package.It also allows for extra flexibility in relation to the payment, reinstatement, grant, increase, cancellation, suspension, or variation of benefitsThese notices and the powers which they carry are not issued lightly. The restrictions in place on New Zealanders’ movements are the most significant in our modern history. I do not underestimate the gravity of what is being asked of you. But we have a limited window of opportunity and we must use every weapon we have.New Zealanders want to see that these measures are being complied with but in a way that we’re used to seeing as New Zealanders. As Police Commissioner Mike Bush said, the Police and the Military will be working together and there is assistance at the ready as required. If people do not follow the message here today, then the police will remind people of their obligations. They have the ability to escalate if required. They can arrest if needed, they can detain if needed. But these are tools of last resort, in a time when I know New Zealanders will rally. Because that is what we do. And so, as we enter into a stage that none of us have experienced before, I want to share a few final messages. Firstly, you are not alone. You will hear us, and see us, daily as we guide New Zealand through this period. It won’t always be perfect. But the principle of what we are trying to do is the right one.Secondly, success won’t be instant. The benefit of what we do today, won’t be felt for many days to come. Expect our numbers to keep rising, because they will. But over time, we will see change if we all stick to the rules. Thirdly, you may not be at work, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have a job. Your job is to save lives, and you can do that by staying home, and breaking the chain. And finally, if you have any questions about what you can or can’t do, apply a simple principle. Act like you have COVID-19. Every move you then make is a risk to someone else. That is how we must all collectively think. That’s why the joy of physically visiting other family, children, grandchildren, friends, neighbours is on hold. Because we’re all now putting each other first. And that is what we as a nation do so well. So New Zealand, be calm, be kind, stay at home. We can break the chain."
2020-03-23T01:11:37Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  Prime Minister: COVID-19 Alert Level increased,"Good afternoon The Cabinet met this morning to discuss our next actions in the fight against COVID-19. Like the rest of the world, we are facing the potential for devastating impacts from this virus. But, through decisive action, and through working together, we have a small window to get ahead of it.   On Saturday I announced a COVID-19 alert level system and placed New Zealand at Alert Level 2. I also said we should all be prepared to move quickly. Now is the time to put our plans into action. We are fortunate to still be some way behind the majority of overseas countries in terms of cases, but the trajectory is clear. Act now, or risk the virus taking hold as it has elsewhere. We currently have 102 cases. But so did Italy once. Now the virus has overwhelmed their health system and hundreds of people are dying every day. The situation here is moving at pace, and so must we.We have always said we would act early. Today 36 new cases were announced. While the majority of these cases continue to be linked to overseas travel in some way, I can also confirm, as did the Director General of Health, that we have 2 cases where public health officials have been unable to find how they came in contact with COVID-19. On that basis, we now consider that there is transmission within our communities.If community transmission takes off in New Zealand the number of cases will double every five days. If that happens unchecked, our health system will be inundated, and tens of thousands of New Zealanders will die. There is no easy way to say that – but it is the reality we have seen overseas – and the possibility we must now face here.Together, we must stop that happening, and we can.Right now we have a window of opportunity to break the chain of community transmission – to contain the virus – to stop it multiplying and to protect New Zealanders from the worst.Our plan is simple. We can stop the spread by staying at home and reducing contact. Now is the time to act.That’s why Cabinet met today and agreed that, effective immediately, we will move to Alert Level 3 nationwide.  After 48 hours, the time required to ensure essential services are in place, we will move to Level 4. These decisions will place the most significant restriction on New Zealanders' movements in modern history. This is not a decision taken lightly. But this is our best chance to slow the virus and to save lives.Let me set out what these changes will mean for everyone. Supermarkets, doctors, pharmacies, service stations, access to essential banking services, will all be available throughout New Zealand at every alert level. If you do not have immediate needs, do not go to the supermarket. It will be there for you today, tomorrow, and the day after that. We must give time for supermarkets to restock their shelves, there will be enough for everyone if we shop normally. In the meantime, we will be working through practices like those used overseas to make sure that social distancing is maintained at supermarkets when people are undertaking essential shops.Non-essential businesses in New Zealand must now close. All bars, restaurants, cafes, gyms, cinemas, pools, museums, libraries, playgrounds and any other place where the public congregate must close their face-to-face function. Over the next 48 hours as we move to Level 4, takeaway services must move to close their operations.All indoor and outdoor events cannot proceed.  In short: we are all now preparing to go into self isolation as a nation. Just as you’ve seen with other countries. Staying at home is essential. It’s a simple but highly effective way to constrain the virus – it denies it places to go, and will help give our healthcare system a fighting chance. So over the next 48 hours every workplace must implement alternative ways of working, people must work from home so that interactions with others are limited.Essential services will need to put in place alternative ways of working that ensure physical distancing of staff of 2 metres, or utilise appropriate Personal Protective Equipment. Schools will be closed from tomorrow, except to the children of essential workers such as our doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers and police – this will give them time to plan. This will be temporary, and schools will close entirely from midnight Wednesday. The school term break will be brought forward. For the remainder of this week and through the term break schools will establish ways to deliver teaching online and remotely. All students across the country are currently being given information on this decision for their parents, including the list of who is considered an essential service. This will be communicated directly to parents.To be absolutely clear we are now asking all New Zealanders who are outside essential services to stay at home, and to stop all interactions with others outside of those in your household.I understand that self isolation is a daunting prospect. So we are being practical. You can leave your home for fresh air, a walk, exercise. To take your children outside. But remember the simple principle. It must be solitary. We are asking that you only spend time with those you are in self isolation with. And if you are outside, keep your distance from others. That means 2 metres at all times. This is the single most important thing we can do right now to stop further community transmission.Travel around New Zealand will also change. Over the next 48 hours, people will need to get home, be it locally or throughout the country. We have asked all air transport providers to ensure social distancing for that period. After 48 hours we will be moving to air travel only applying to the transport of people undertaking essential services and the transport of freight.Public transport will also begin to transition over the next 48 hours and will only be available for those working in essential services, for medical reasons, and to move essential goods – including ferry services between the North and South Island.Further details on the transition we are all now making will be made publicly available on the COVID-19 website. Now I want to share with you what will happen while we are all in Alert Level 4 to get ahead of COVID-19.We will continue to vigorously contact trace every single case. Testing will continue at pace to help us understand the current number of cases in New Zealand and where they are based. If we flush out the cases we already have and see transmission slow, we will potentially be able to move areas out of Level 4 over time. But for the next wee while, things will look worse before they look better. In the short term the number of cases will likely rise because the virus is already in our community. But these new measures can slow the virus down and prevent our health system from being overwhelmed and ultimately save lives. To be successful though, to stop community transmission which has a lag time, these measures will need to be in place for 4 weeks. Again, I want to reiterate, you will be able to make regular visits to essential services in that time. If we after those 4 weeks we have been successful, we hope we will be able to ease up on restrictions. If we haven’t, we’ll find ourselves living with them for longer. That’s why sticking to the rules matters. If we don’t – if you hang out with that friend at a park or see that family member for lunch, you risk spreading COVID -19 and extending everyone’s time in Level 4.Our low number of cases compared to the rest of the world gives us a chance, but does not mean we have escaped. I do not underestimate what I am asking New Zealanders to do. It’s huge. And I know it will feel daunting. But I wanted to share with you the stark choice we face.New medical modelling considered by the Cabinet today suggests that without the measures I have just announced up to tens of thousands of New Zealanders could die from COVID-19. Everything you will all give up for the next few weeks, all of the lost contact with others, all of the isolation, and difficult time entertaining children – it will literally save lives. Thousands of lives. The worst case scenario is simply intolerable. It would represent the greatest loss of New Zealanders’ lives in our country’s history. I will not take that chance. I would rather make this decision now, and save those lives, and be in lockdown for a shorter period, than delay, and see New Zealanders lose loved ones and their contact with each other for an even longer period. I hope you are all with me on that.Together we have an opportunity to contain the spread and prevent the worst. I cannot stress enough the need for every New Zealander to follow the advice I have laid out today.The Government will do all it can to protect you .Now I’m asking you to do everything you can to protect us all. None of us can do this alone. Your actions will be critical to our collective ability to stop the spread of COVID-19.Failure to play your part in the coming days will put the lives of others at risk. There will be no tolerance for that and we will not hesitate in using enforcement powers if needed. We’re in this together and must unite against COVID-19.I am in no doubt that the measures I have announced today will cause unprecedented economic and social disruption. But they are necessary. I have one final message. Be kind. I know people will want to act as enforcers. And I understand that, people are afraid and anxious. We will play that role for you. What we need from you, is to support one another. Go home tonight and check in on your neighbours. Start a phone tree with your street. Plan how you’ll keep in touch with one another. We will get through this together, but only if we stick together. Be strong and be kind. I am now going to hand over to the Finance Minister to set out the additional support measures agreed by Cabinet today to provide income guarantees to those whose livelihood is disrupted by the virus.Straight after that Minister Hipkins will talk through some of the specific decisions as they relate to education. Following that we are making available Commissioner of Police, Mike Bush, who has been playing a key role in the operational side, and John Ombler the Controller of the All of Government response to speak with you and answer additional questions. "
2020-03-20T23:19:20Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  PM Address - Covid-19 Update ,"Kia ora koutou katoaI’m speaking directly to all New Zealanders today to give you as much certainty and clarity as we can as we fight Covid-19.Over the past few weeks, the world has changed. And it has changed very quickly. In February it would have seemed unimaginable to close New Zealand’s borders to the world, and now it has been an obvious step as we fight COVID-19.This is because we are experiencing an unprecedented event – a global pandemic that in New Zealand, we have moved to fight by going hard, and going early.I understand that all of this rapid change creates anxiety, and uncertainty. Especially when it means changing how we live. That’s why today I am going to set out for you as clearly as possible, what you can expect as we continue to fight the virus together.The first really important thing to remember, is that the vast majority of people who will ever have COVID 19 will only experience mild to moderate symptoms. But there will be some who need more care.That’s why we have to focus on one simple goal – to slow down Covid 19.Slowing it down, means not having one big tidal wave of cases, but instead, smaller waves - groups of cases that we can manage properly as they arise. That means we reduce the impact on health, on jobs and on our economy. Some countries have successfully managed to do this –but it does mean we have to be ready to step up our action when we need to.Here’s how we will know what to do and when.Already in New Zealand we have warning systems to try and get ahead of problems and hazards. We all know and recognise signs that tell us when we have fire risk Or when to reduce our water use.Today I am announcing an alert system for COVID-19. That alert system can apply to the whole country, but sometimes, it may only apply to certain towns or cities.There are four levels to the alert system. At each level there are things we need you to do, to keep you safe. And there are things the government will do too.Alert Level One is where COVID-19 is here, but contained. In this phase we prepare. The basics, like border measures, contact tracing, and cancelling mass gatherings are activated. You’ll see that this is where we have been when COVID first arrived in New Zealand.Alert Level Two is where the disease is contained but the risks are growing because we have more cases. This is when we move to reduce our contact with one another. We increase our border measures, and we cancel events. This is also the level where we ask people to work differently if they can, and cancel unnecessary travel.Alert Level Three is where the disease is increasingly difficult to contain. This is where we restrict our contact by stepping things up again. We close public venues and ask non-essential businesses to close.Alert Level Four is where we have sustained transmission. This is where we eliminate contact with each other altogether. We keep essential services going but ask everyone to stay at home until COVID-19 is back under control.It’s important to note, that at every alert level supermarkets and essential services, like access to pharmaceuticals will continue. Shop normally. If we do that, our supermarkets will have time to restock their shelves.We will use this alert system every time we update our cases, so you’ll know if the status in your area has gone up, or down, or stayed the same. And what you’ll need to do.Today I am confirming that New Zealand is at alert level two.That means the risk of community transmission is growing, and so to stay ahead and reduce the chances of the wave growing, we need to step things up.We already have many of the measures for level two in place. But there are some that are new.Here are the things that we need from you:Today we are asking people over 70 years of age, or people who have compromised immunity or have underlying respiratory conditions to stay at home as much as they can.That means we need friends, family and neighbours to support our older New Zealanders and people who may be in this group by doing simple things like keeping in contact and dropping off food or other supplies. And when you do, make sure you are not sick, that you are using good handwashing practices, and keeping your distance.We also need everyone to start working differently. Many offices have plans for workers to work from home. Others have staggered meal breaks or shift based working. We are now asking you to implement these plans.We know not everyone can do this. We need and will continue to have health and emergency professionals, transport and delivery staff, supermarket and food production workers, and other essential people continuing on at their place of work. And there are some sectors where work from home is impossible. There are steps these workplaces should take all the same, like additional cleaning, and physical distancing as much as possible.And finally, we are asking that you limit your movement around the country. This will help us track and contain any spread of COVID-19. That means cutting non-essential domestic travel.Every unnecessary movement gives COVID-19 a chance to spread.For those of you who are parents or caregivers, you will have questions about schools and education facilities. At alert level two, schools will be closed if there is a case that effects a school, as we have been doing to date. That may change if we move into higher alert levels. Sending children home at this stage though, doesn’t necessarily reduce transmission in the community, but I can assure you we are constantly monitoring these settings to keep children safe. As a mum, I can assure you that is my key consideration.Finally, this is a time when I know people will want as much information as possible. It’s also a time when there is plenty of mis-information. All the advice from the government about COVID-19 and how it affects you is available at www.covid19.govt.nz including more detailed guidance on this announcement.Till then, I know this current situation is causing huge disruption and uncertainty. And right now I cannot tell you when that will end. This alert system is designed to help us through that – so please do stay tuned as we share daily updates – especially as alert levels can move from one level to the next in a short space of time, as we have seen elsewhere in the world.For now, I ask that New Zealand does what we do so well. We are a country that is creative, practical, and community minded. We may not have experienced anything like this in our lifetimes, but we know how to rally and we know how to look after one another, and right now what could be more important than that. So thank you for all that you’re about to do.Please be strong, be kind, and unite against COVID-19"

That relationship is a respected long standing one.The work we do at Te Puni Kōkiri now sits alongside a broad Government commitment to deliver housing solutions from the homeless to homeowners . ·       Māori are overrepresented among people experiencing homelessness. We know compared to December 2015 in December last year there has been a 300 percent increase in the demand on the housing register for Māori alone. ·       In Whangārei alone there were 321 whānau who required assistance last year compared to 2015 where there was only 70 whānau who needed assistance. ·       We need new approaches to tackle the issues that whānau with insecure housing face. ·       That’s why earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a plan to ensure our whānau who are homeless or most at risk of homelessness are looked after. ·       This Plan has four key pillars; Prevention, supply, support and system enablers. This includes 1000 new transitional housing places delivered by the end of the year. ·       More funding to programmes that prevent those at risk of losing their rentals and supporting people out of motels and into permanent accommodation.·       We also believe Kaupapa Māori approaches provide a different approach that model solutions for whānau and their community. ·       It’s about people, housing and the supports that can be provided from the community. ·       This model in Ōtangarei will include wrap around social services and support for whanau. ·       The three-phase process being adopted will move whānau into more secure transitional housing, then on to permanent housing and employment; and finally, secure housing or home ownership and community contribution. ·       This approach recognises that we need to work in partnership and we want to ensure that we are able to walk alongside you to achieve these broader aspirations. ·       Kāinga Ora Homes and Communities, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development and Te Puni Kōkiri working in partnership with Te Hau Āwhiowhio ō Ōtangarei and Ōtangarei Papakāinga Limited are involved in this approach as is MSD and I anticipate as the model evolves the Council and other providers will support a kaupapa Māori approach. ·       When I initially  visited Otangarei, it was clear that your community had a sense of what would work for Otangarei whanau first – nobody else except yourselves. ·       So projects such as this is one way we can learn from your approach and perhaps apply elsewhere.·       From the sod-turn, laying the foundation and the infrastructure works through to construction and all the planning and specialist trades in between.·       I understand that this project used local businesses and suppliers. Knowing that we have a high need for employment in the region and community you too can enable and empower our whānau to be utilised and employed as part of these types of projects.·       Housing is a big issue for our whānau in Te Taitokerau. In 2019 we together with the Ministry of Social Development and Housing New Zealand commissioned research to look at supply and demand of housing in Te Taitokerau. ·       Key findings included:o  Large proportions of Māori households are stressed and are in need;o  Declining affordability affects both renters and owner-occupier households;o  Home ownership level are lower for Māori compared to non-Māori and renting levels are higher; ando  Overcrowding is the most significant housing issue and occurs in both owned and rented housing. ·       Further the report identifies immediate action through: o  Increasing the supple of new build, affordable, right sized housing;o  Upgrading existing stock where viable or replacement of non-upgradeable dwellings with new builds; ando  Partnered, cross-government and Iwi/Māori service provider approached being implemented to generate evidence and solutions. ·       In Te Taitokerau we’ve aligned our work programme to respond to these recommended actions highlighted in the report. ·       Te Puni Kōkiri has been able to support 18 housing project and distribute over $4.6 million in the region to provide a broad range of housing support options for whānau Māori. ·       We have supported over 30 whānau to repair their properties to ensure they the new standards of living, with the hope that all New Zealanders have a safe, warm and healthy home. ·       Last year between July and December we manage to approve over 16 new housing projects in Te Taitokerau. ·       The projects include, Te Rūnanga o Whaingaroa who are working on essential repairs to whānau homes in Tākou Bay for the past three years.  ·       Their initiative – Te Oranga o Ngā Hapori – takes an integrated approach towards enabling a thriving, sustainable and self-reliant Tākou Bay community.  ·       This is a whānau-led community development approach where housing contributes toward achieving intergenerational wellbeing in Māori communities. ·       In Kaitaia since October 2019, eight whānau totalling 34 people are now in homes on the rent-to-own programme at He Korowai Trust.  ·       The programme used surplus houses re-located from Auckland to Kaitāia, with a long-term rent-to-own model for low income whānau Māori. This is part of Te Puni Kōkiri’s trialling of innovative home ownership models. ·       Housing is just one part of the government’s support for whānau Māori; the other focus has been on whenua. In Te Taitokerau we have supported over 3,900 hectares of Māori-owned land for whenua development. ·       In addition to this over 1,400 owners of Māori-owned land are being supported with whenua development.·       We’ve launched tupu.nz, the whenua knowledge website to help land owners access important data and information about the specific land block and its potential capability for productive use. ·       Regional advisory services are also available throughout team at TPK to help land owners map out a plan from succession to governance to accessing finance. ·       I also just announced a package of changes to the Local government (Rating) Act which will remove some of the barriers to using and developing Māori land. I mention these changes because we know there is a direct link to significant challenges.·       The other topic which I just want to also mention is the kaupapa of water. I know that the north is currently experiencing issues with water.·       I want to acknowledge the efforts Councils from Whangarei to the Far North have gone to develop an immediate response during the drought. Long term resilience and planning for meeting drinking water, municipal and industry needs is a serious next step as we consider a future where land development and housing needs will grow.·       We have also made an initial contribution of $ 2 million to support the local response to the drought with Minister Henare working with Local Mayors and NIWA on a plan going forward. ·       To close, housing is an anchor for overall well-being. Good quality housing and access to good education, employment, transport and cultural services, is a building block for thriving whānau and developing strong Māori communities. ·       Ko te whare e hanga te tangata, ko te tangata e hangaia e te whare. The whare (whare tangata) builds the people and the people build the whare. ·       I look forward to seeing further updates and watching as I hear stories of the whānau who will occupy this papakāinga flourish and thrive. ·       Nō reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā rā koutou katoa.

That commitment is of the utmost importance as New Zealand faces its greatest health and economic challenge in over a generation. Our response in these times must be to put our people first.  This period of time will be a test of our resilience but also of our commitment to each other.  He Waka Eke Noa. We are all in this together.Today’s economic package is about cashflow and confidence. It is only the beginning of what this government will do to support New Zealanders through this time of crisis and lead our recovery and rebuilding. We will fight this virus. We will cushion the blow for businesses and workersWe will position for recovery.We have been and we will be swift, decisive and compassionate.Mr Speaker, the global COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc around the world. The virus’ exponential spread has seen whole countries shut down in their attempts to slow and contain the spread. The result has been unprecedented economic and social disruption right across the globe. And we are not immune of course.  I cannot, and must not sugar coat this.  A recession in New Zealand is now almost certain, with the advice that we are receiving that the shock will be larger than that seen during the Global Financial Crisis.This will affect every part of our economy, now and for some time to come.  We are going to see many New Zealanders lose their jobs, and some businesses fail, we will have an extended period of deficits and our debt as a country will have to substantially increase.  Our package announced today, and the support that will continue to come will do all we can to cushion the blow.It is heartening though Mr Speaker that we face this with our books in good shape.  We have kept net debt low at 19.5%, which is lower than we inherited it.  We have worked hard to be ready for the rainy day that has now arrived. There is no costless decision in this situation.  The economic impacts of the spread of COVID 19 were clear before our decision to extend border restrictions.  I stand by the wisdom and courage of that decision. We are taking decisive action to avoid what we have seen overseas and implement measures that give ourselves a fighting chance of mitigating the worst here – and I make no apologies for that.Whatever costs we are now dealing with pale in comparison to the loss of life and devastation that would come with inaction.Clearly there are tough times ahead. I acknowledge the anxiety and uncertainty many will be feeling right now. I want to say directly to those people- we will get through this, together.The Government’s Economic Response Package is the largest investment in our lifetimes, designed for the unique nature of the disruption caused by COVID-19. It comes on top of the $12 billion NZ Upgrade programme. I want to thank New Zealand First and the Green Party for their work in helping put this package together.The overall investment in the Economic Response Package is $12.1 billion across the forecast period, one of the largest response packages in the world on a per capita basis. To give you an idea of the scale the package I am announcing today it represents nearly 4% of GDP and more than the total of all of the new operating spending in the three Budgets in this term of government put together.The package has three components:Extra support for the health system to enable an increased public health response so New Zealand can slow any potential domestic outbreak,A substantial package to cushion the impact of the economic shock on businesses and workers, and support confidence in the near term; andThe first phase of a broader recovery package to support household incomes through the shock and to spur the economic recovery. Obviously the ultimate recovery package will go beyond these measures, and this year’s Budget to be the second phase of the broader recovery package.Our first response is a public health one.  It is our fundamental duty.  It is also the first and best economic response.  The hard work and dedication of our health workforce, and the personal responsibility that New Zealanders are showing with regard to protecting themselves and others is a great first line of defence. We must continue that work to smooth the curve of the inevitable increase in infections. Today’s package includes a commitment of an additional $500 million to support our ‘Go hard, Go early, Contain COVID-19’ strategy. There will be further support to come.  Under this plan the health system is increasing capacity and capability. This will mean:Scaling up public communications to ensure people have practical advice and support to contain the virus and stay healthy, and on how to self-isolate.Ensuring continuity of care in the community. This has two elements: surging support for vulnerable populations, and supporting the health workforce to respond.Strengthening our ability to test and trace cases in communities. Strengthening our ability to treat cases – in both the community and in hospitals.To achieve this, our actions over the next 30 days will be split into two phases:Immediate actions include a public information campaign, upscaling testing, boosting Healthline, surging containment and isolation procedures, establishing Community Based Assessment Clinics, and a whole-of-system focus on meeting workforce demand and PPE needs. Our Medium-term actions include further support for hospitals and community providers to deal with a surge of patients, including further advice for caring for people at home.Mr Speaker I want to pay tribute to the health professionals and staff who are working around the clock to protect New Zealanders well-being.   We owe you so much and today’s package is just the first sign of our support for your work. In addition to the significant boost to the health system I have mentioned we are also introducing a COVID-19 leave payment scheme to incentivise self-isolation by employees, the self-employed and contractors.  Self-isolation is critical to the success of our public health strategy, and we know that some workers are facing financial barriers to self-isolation.This scheme will provide support through employers (and to sole traders and the self-employed) for those people unable to work who are either in self-isolation, are sick or are caring for dependents who are in either of these situations. Employers will still be expected to meet all of their sick leave and other employment expectations. The key parameters for the scheme are:An entitlement period of 14 days for those self-isolating, and for the entire period of sickness for those who contract COVID-19.Eligibility is open to all firms, the self-employed, and for contractors, but not for those who can work from home.Full time workers will receive $585 per week under the scheme.The scheme will be in place for an initial 8 week period, at which point the Government will reassess based on the health situation at the time. Employers will have to sign a declaration confirming that they meet the criteria for receiving this funding. Any false declaration would be committing fraud.Given the size and speed of the economic shock we are facing, we recognise the immediate need to support businesses and workers to cushion the economic impact on households and firms. We want to help boost both cash flow and confidence in the economy through this uncertain period.  That is why we are establishing a wage subsidy scheme.The scheme will help keep people attached to their workplace, so that both workers and businesses are in a better position to adjust to the difficult prevailing economic conditions.The scheme will be available to all businesses in all sectors nationwide, and includes the self-employed and sole traders. Eligible firms will be provided a lump sum payment of the equivalent of $585 per week per full-time employee and $350 per week per part time employee for 12 weeks up to a cap of $150,000. To qualify businesses must declare they have had a 30% decline in revenue due to COVID-19 month-on-month for any month between January and June this year (compared to last year), and that they have talked to their bank about assistance. Employers can make applications for the scheme from today by filling out a simple form on the Work and Income website and making a declaration.  The Ministry of Social Development have advised us that they will be able to make payments starting in five days time.At this point I want to acknowledge the extraordinary work by the Ministry of Social Development and other public servants in pulling this package together under incredible time constraints.  I ask everyone for patience in working with our public servants at this stressful time.  Depending on uptake, this package could inject up to $5.1 billion into the economy over the next two months.Where possible, we want to keep people actively engaged with the labour market, or in training to smooth their return to work. To support this we have established a $100 million funding to support worker redeployment and training. The first announcement on this will be a package for the Tairawhiti region in the coming days.The Government is undertaking work on how to support large and complex employers on a case by case basis.The Government is also actively working in partnership with the banks to understand the impact of Covid-19 on access to working capital for businesses.We recognise that it is in the interests of businesses, banks and the government to work together to support firms through this situation.In collaboration with the banks we will monitor pressure points as they emerge, and we reinforce the NZBA message advising any business facing issues to talk with their bank for advice and support.The decisions of the Reserve Bank to cut the official cash rate, and to delay the introduction of the new capital requirements for banks frees up banks to further support customers.  I continue to urge banks and customers to talk now about their plans to get through this crisis.  The government and the Reserve Bank are coordinating our actions to support the overall stability of the economy. Today’s package also contains an indicative investment in our aviation sector that will be finalised in the coming days.  It is essential that we keep open air routes to support returning New Zealanders and to keep vital supply chains open, and that we support essential services at and around our border. Mr Speaker, today’s package also implements a number of tax changes to help increase businesses’ cash flows and stimulate investment. The changes include:The reinstatement of depreciation deductions for commercial and industrial buildings at a 2% diminishing value applying from the 2020-21 tax year (generally beginning next month);Increasing the threshold for provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000 applying from the 2020-21 tax year (generally beginning next month);Increasing the threshold for writing off low value assets to $5,000 for the next tax year, before reverting to $1,000 in the longer term;Giving a time-limited discretion to Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (the interest on tax debt) if a taxpayer is unable to pay on time due to the impacts of COVID-19.We also recognise that the Government must provide further support to boost the economy to ensure that a recovery takes and support our most vulnerable at this time. This first part of the package comprises: A $25 across the board permanent increase to main benefits, from 1 April 2020;A doubling of the amount paid in 2020 through the Winter Energy Payment; andRemoving the hours test from the In Work Tax Credit to assist those who may face variable hours.The ultimate recovery package will go well beyond these measures, and I intend to re-orient this year’s Budget to be the second phase of the broader recovery package. Today is not the day to go into further detail about the recovery and re-building phase. But for now let me say this. In New Zealand we have been here before with major economic and social crises. In my lifetime we have seen governments respond with austerity and ideology that has done enormous damage to the fabric of our society. But we also have other examples such as the first Labour Government who responded with investment, pragmatism, optimism and kindness. It is from them that I take my lesson on how we recover and rebuild in a just, fair and far-sighted manner.Mr Speaker we are in for a fight.  A fight against a virus, an outside force beyond our control that is wreaking havoc around the globe.  We are up for the fight.  There is no better defensive line than the All Blacks.  Just is it as with our people facing this virus.We are in as good a position going into this as we can be. We are taking bold and decisive actions to respond to uncertain and unprecedented times.My message to New Zealanders is simple.  Look after yourself, look after your family, look after our elderly. Look out for each other. There are tough days ahead, but we will get through this together.  "

When this event was first organised the focus for my contribution was going to be to look at some of the longer term issues and opportunities facing the New Zealand and Wellington economies, and I will still briefly touch on them, but for reasons that you will all understand I am going to focus my comments today on the Government’s planning for, and response to, the economic impacts of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.It’s important to remember at the outset that this is first and foremost a public health issue. It is also the case that the best and first way to protect the economy is by containing the spread of this virus.People’s health remains our top priority. We’ve acted swiftly and decisively to keep New Zealanders safe, putting in place extra border controls, requiring higher risk travellers to self-isolate in accordance with expert medical advice, and scaling up health staff at airports to check passengers arriving on international flights.  A critical element for countries who have been able to manage the spread of the virus remains contact tracing.  For the five cases that we have had so far we have traced 100% of the close contacts they have had while carrying the virus.  That will be a tough percentage to keep up as we have more cases but it must continue to be our goal.The other part of our response that is working well is self-isolation. Well over 8,000 New Zealanders have self-isolated.  This kind of personal responsibility is essential to containing the virus.  New Zealanders should be proud of their response in this regard.Simple but effective actions like washing your hands properly, sneezing into the inside of your elbow, and staying away from work or public events if you’re sick are vitally important.For both the public health and economic response this is not just a government response or a business response.  It must be a New Zealand response.  We are all in this together and we will get through this.New Zealand has a world-class health system and we’re well-prepared to keep New Zealanders safe.  The declaration today by the World Health Organisation of a global pandemic changes little about New Zealand’s response. Our Pandemic Plan has been operational since the beginning of the year.  It gives us the framework to manage the different phases of this kind of situation.  We have the medical supplies, the access to specialist facilities and the workforce to guide us through the coming months.The increased investment we have made in our health system over the last two Budgets sees us facing this situation with improved confidence in the resilience of our health sector. I have made clear to the Minister of Health that there is no question here about resources.  We will do what it takes to keep our people healthy and safe.There will no doubt be bumps along the road, but we’re taking expert advice, and making decisive calls in the best interests of New Zealand and New Zealanders. This is a rapidly evolving situation and while there is much uncertainty about the COVID-19 outbreak, it is clear that it is going to impact the world economy, and therefore New Zealand's economy, for all of 2020. As we know from events like the global financial crisis and the Canterbury earthquakes, New Zealand is not immune to economic shocks that are beyond our control. However, this situation is very different to other challenges the New Zealand economy has faced in the past decade. We need to remember that this is not a structural economic problem, nor a natural disaster.The Canterbury and Kaikōura earthquakes were events that impacted defined areas, where it was clear which businesses were affected, why, and how. Through the GFC we saw structural issues that nearly led to the collapse of the global financial system. With COVID-19, which is an evolving, global health crisis, we are seeing different businesses in the same industries and in the same regions impacted differently.For some this is a supply problem, which may be short term as China begins to return to a sense of normality.  For others it is a demand issue driven by a severe reduction in tourism or the phenomenon of social distancing.But this is a not a about a fundamental weakness in the New Zealand economy.  It therefore requires a tailor-made response, not wholesale changes and knee jerk reactions.We are focussed on supporting the wellbeing and livelihoods of New Zealanders and their businesses through this difficult period, so that when the economy recovers we are all in a strong position to bounce back. While the Government has an important leadership role to play throughout this time, it is up to all New Zealanders and businesses to do their part as well.Our position going inBefore I run through the next phases of our economic response I do want to begin by restating the strong position New Zealand has in going into this global health crisis.We go into this situation with the economy in good shape.The economy showed solid momentum in late 2019.The Government’s accounts for the first six months of the fiscal year – to the end of December 2019 – were strong. We had a surplus over the first six months of our fiscal year, sitting $500 million higher than expected due to the stronger economy. Tax revenue, including corporate tax and GST, were running ahead of forecast – highlighting the underlying strength of our businesses and our economy.We saw both consumer and business confidence lift higher through the end of 2019.We go into this with our unemployment rate having ticked down to 4%. By contrast, Australia’s rate has ticked up to 5.3%.Wage growth was around decade highs in the December 2019 quarter at 3.6% - well above inflation.On Tuesday, we saw Stats NZ data showing the total volume of manufacturing sales had its strongest quarterly rise in six years in the final quarter of 2019, up 2.7 percent.And last week we saw data showing the terms of trade hit a record high in the December quarter.We go into this with our OCR higher than many other advanced economies, and therefore more room to move if the Reserve Bank Monetary Policy Committee decides to do so. We have had $12 billion of surpluses in our first two years in Government, and are forecast to have further surpluses across the forecast period.And of course, we have very low Government debt compared to the rest of the world.  At 19.5% of GDP as at the end of January we are well below the 22% that we inherited from the previous Government. Credit ratings agency Moody’s recently reported that New Zealand’s Government debt position is significantly lower than other countries with its top Aaa rating.As our friends in Australia look to boost infrastructure, we have already got ahead of the curve with the announcement of our $12 billion investment in infrastructure through the New Zealand Upgrade Programme. This will continue to support growth long after the impacts of coronavirus have worn off, by making targeted investments around the country, creating jobs and supporting businesses and local communities.All of this demonstrates the solid underlying momentum of the New Zealand economy at the end of 2019, which has us in a strong position to respond now to the uncertainty that we face.Where we are nowAs we all know, the effects of COVID 19 are already being felt and will continue to be so.  In a rapidly evolving situation we have used three scenarios to guide our planning and our response.As I have previously outlined, scenario one predicted a temporary global demand shock where we experienced a short sharp shock on the New Zealand economy across the first half of 2020, before growth rebounded in the second half as exports return to normal.It is clear that we moved beyond that over the last couple of weeks to be firmly in to scenario two with a longer lasting shock to the domestic economy, as the global impact feeds through to the economy for the whole of 2020, and where there are cases in New Zealand. That is the phase we are in and where we are deploying our plan to target those workers, businesses and industries most affected.The third scenario that we are planning for is to respond to a sustained global downturn, if that were to occur.In terms of China the impact has been huge. China’s manufacturing PMI fell from 50 in January to just 35.7 in February, its lowest level on record. The non-manufacturing PMI fell from 54.1 to 29.6.Higher frequency data on Chinese activity is showing that there has been some improvement, but the economy continues to operate at a greatly reduced capacity.In other countries the spread of the virus has been dramatic in places such as Italy. South Korea and Iran.  It is in every corner of the globe. We can see these global impacts playing out across various sectors and locations around New Zealand.Data from Customs shows that Chinese arrivals between 1 February and 9 March were down 80% compared to the same period in 2019. New Zealanders also appear to be travelling a little less, with departures down 5% over the same period.Experimental data from Stats NZ indicates that exports to China have declined in the last 6 weeks or so, particularly in forestry and seafood, although the dairy sector is proving resilient and appears to still be seeing export growth.While other export markets have held up there will clearly be an impact should further restrictive actions be taken, such as Italy’s nationwide containment measures.We have started to see the employment impacts resulting from this economic disruption, particularly in forestry in Tairawhiti. And in the Tourism and Hospitality sectors effects are showing now, and forward bookings have dried up. In other sectors and parts of the country the impacts are not as great, but naturally everyone is anxious. These factors are all starting to flow through to economic confidence. On Tuesday ANZ released preliminary business confidence data for March, showing firms’ activity intentions at their lowest since June 2009. ANZ’s latest consumer confidence index for February eased just 1 point, however I expect this will come out weaker when we see the March index.We are seeing this play out in the financial markets. The 90-day interest rate has fallen by around 40 basis points since the start of the year. Global stock markets are well down on the start of the year and remain volatile. So that is a brief summary of where we are at. Of course this situation is rapidly evolving and we are constantly seeing new developments. What we are doing immediatelyAs you know, we moved quickly to support particular industries that have been affected, including tourism and the seafood industry.  We have boosted funding for business advisory services, instructed government departments to pay their bills within 10 days and removed the stand down period for workers who lose their jobs. Inland Revenue and MSD are supporting businesses and workers on issues like provisional tax readjustments, remission of late payment and filing fees, wage instalment plans, and income support.MSD's rapid response teams are in place in regions like Tairāwhiti, and we have removed the stand-down period. I have been talking regularly with business groups, unions and individual business owners over the last few weeks.  As I said earlier, we are all in this together.Banks have stepped forward to provide an assurance that they will work with their customers to get through this difficult time.  They have committed to working with affected customers, are reducing or suspending principal payments on loans and temporarily moving to interest-only repayments, helping with restructuring business loans, consolidating loans to help make repayments more manageable, providing access to short-term funding, and referring individual customers to budgeting services. I want to reiterate the importance of conversations now between banks and customers as the first port of call.I want to thank businesses who have remained accommodating and flexible as they can around issues like sick leave, and I want to thank Business NZ and the CTU for their help in preparing advice on these issues which is available on the employment.govt.nz website.What’s nextThe Government’s is now moving to the next phases of responses to potential further ongoing impacts of the coronavirus.Any measures the Government takes must be: timely, fiscally sustainable, targeted to those who need it, andproportionate to the level of economic shock.Under these criteria, we are currently developing three further phases of response.1. The Business Continuity PackageEarly next week we will announce the details of the next phase of the Government’s economic response – our Business Continuity Package. This package is aimed at supporting cashflow and confidence, which are critical factors at present.The Business Continuity Package includes: a targeted wage subsidy scheme for workers in the most adversely affected sectorstraining and redeployment options for affected employees, and working with banks on the potential for future working capital support for companies that face temporary credit constraints. You will understand that a wage subsidy will have to have criteria and limits. It will also have to be tailor-made. We want to target the subsidies to those who are most affected and least able to adjust. We are also working on adjustments to the tax system to support businesses to manage cashflow and support them to maintain employment. And we are developing options to ensure that MSD can support individuals and businesses to provide temporary financial assistance and support to vulnerable individuals and families. Further details of this package will be announced next week.2. Preparing a macroeconomic package.Should the economic impact worsen, causing a major, sustained global downturn, we are working on a further phase of measures to respond as necessary. Under this scenario I have instructed officials to develop longer-term macroeconomic measures that may be required to support the economy, businesses, and workers if there is a major, sustained global downturn. Such measures could include tax and welfare changes that support incomes and consumption, and help businesses stay afloat.We want to make sure that this scale of intervention would not only support incomes but also our overall economic, environmental and social goals.  We need to support improving our productivity and sustainability through, for example, training and education, supporting infrastructure and conservation projects.Having managed the books well with surpluses and low debt, we are in a good position to be able to deliver these measures if we need to.I reiterate that while we are planning for that situation, we are not predicting it, but planning for it is the responsible thing to do.3. The Recovery PhaseThe further piece of work we have directed officials to commence work on is the recovery phase. As I have said, the economy will recover from this, so we need to ensure we are well-placed to bounce back strongly when we do.I have directed officials to begin working on a package designed to support the entire economy as we come out the other side. Already, plans are under way to adopt an NZ Inc. approach to re-engaging with China. I would like to see this approach for other markets, and in other sectors. The final shape of this package will obviously depend on the ultimate economic shock we feel from COVID-19. It will include measures to help us diversify our export and import markets – one of many lessons we will no doubt learn from all this.As the global public health and economic situations continue to evolve, these phases of response will ensure that we are ready and prepared for the different eventualities New Zealand may face over the coming months.All the while, the Government is continuing to focus on the implementation of our economic plan.  While we are in the eye of the storm it is vital we push on with addressing the core challenges and opportunities for our future prosperity.  Working to the goal of a more productive, sustainable and inclusive economy is even more important today than it ever has been. ConclusionI want to reiterate that we all need to work together in times like this. It is the Government’s role to provide leadership, guidance and to keep everyone updated on the facts, but all New Zealanders have a role to play in getting through this. Scaremongering and knee jerk reactions are not what we need right now. Our ongoing economic response will remain timely, targeted and sustainable. We will support Kiwi firms and families to make it through this shock so that they can bounce back on the other side.While the economic impacts are very real, this is first and foremost a public health issue. The best way to protect the economy is to contain the virus.So, wash your hands, cough or sneeze into your elbow, stay home if you are unwell.  And look out for each other and show some kindness.  That’s a Kiwi value at any time, but especially needed now. Thank you."

We are also privileged to have with us here today Ms Izumi Nakamitsu, the United Nations High Representative for Disarmament Affairs to New Zealand, and the United Nations Secretary-General’s foremost adviser on disarmament.  Ms Nakamitsu has travelled from New York to share her insights and speak with us on these important issues. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. And with the 2020 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference next month in New York, this Symposium offers an important opportunity to reflect on the state of nuclear disarmament around the globe.  We are pleased to host this event here in New Zealand’s Parliament – the very place where we adopted ground-breaking legislation to create a nuclear-free New Zealand, over 30 years ago.   Although the adoption of this legislation settled the nuclear issue for New Zealand - it is very far from being fixed for the world.  Nuclear disarmament remains a pressing item on the UN’s agenda and continues to be described as the UN membership’s oldest – as well as its highest - security priority.  For most members of the international community, the effort to reach a nuclear weapon-free world has long been channelled through the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. This year we celebrate the NPT’s fiftieth anniversary. New Zealand has a vision of a world free of nuclear weapons.  We will continue to advocate for this vision in New York at the Treaty’s Review Conference in April alongside our key partners and members of the New Agenda Coalition.   This vision informs our participation in initiatives aimed at breaking the current deadlock on nuclear disarmament, including New Zealand’s recent participation at the Ministerial meeting of the “Stepping Stones” initiative in Berlin. But despite these efforts, the global threat of use continues to increase. States possessing nuclear weapons have withdrawn from arms control agreements, are modernising their arsenals, and developing new capabilities.  The hopes for a world where nuclear weapon testing is prohibited by international law has not borne fruit: New Zealand and all our Pacific colleagues have fought hard for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.  It is almost 25 years since the last recorded nuclear test in our region took place at Mururoa. But despite the deplorable environmental and health consequences of testing in our region the possibility of the Test Ban Treaty entering into force remains very remote. We – in the Pacific – are too well aware of the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons.  However there have, however, been some positive developments worth mentioning. Two years ago we saw the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  This represents one of the few concrete steps taken in recent years towards the disarmament obligation in the NPT. We are seriously pleased that it is well on the way to entry into force.    Also on the positive side of the ledger are the UN’s renewed efforts to spur momentum on disarmament, which Secretary-General Guterres describes as “disarmament to save humanity”,  New Zealand remains a strong supporter of the Secretary General’s Agenda for Disarmament, and this Government will continue to support its work towarding reducing nuclear risk.New Zealand’s primary focus continues to be calling for a reduction in the operational launch readiness of nuclear weapons – a move away from so-called ‘hair-trigger status’.  We advocate for this via our membership of the ‘De-Alerting Group’, a grouping that we currently chair.As the Secretary General’s chief official responsible for the Agenda for Disarmament, we look forward to hearing Ms Nakamitsu’s assessment of how it has fared in the two years’ since its promulgation, what the prospects are for the NPT Review Conference in New York next month, and how we can begin to move forward on a path towards the total elimination of nuclear weapons. Let us now welcome Ms Nakamitsu, the UN’s High Representative for Disarmament Affairs, to the podium.  "
2020-03-05T05:57:57Z,                                                                                                                    Hon David Parker                    ,  Elevate NZ Venture Capital Fund is open for business,"Elevate Venture Capital Fund Launch event: Wednesday 4 March, 2020. Hon David Parker Associate Minister of Finance It is a pleasure to be here tonight at the launch of our new venture capital fund Elevate New Zealand. I know my colleagues Minister Robertson and Minister Twyford wanted to join us tonight, but had to stay in Wellington.I think we should acknowledge from the outset that we are making this announcement against the background of uncertain times; for the rules-based international trading system but also – more recently - the international health crisis of coronavirus and its rapidly-evolving impact on trade, growth and the global economy.Our response to coronavirus is led by our responsibility to protect the health and wellbeing of our people. That is why our first priority will always be a public health response.But we also must respond to the economic consequences. We are in a strong position to stand up to the economic impacts of coronavirus, with unemployment down to 4 per cent, low public debt (down to 19.5% of GDP from 22.5% when we took office) a surplus in the first seven months of the fiscal year, an extensive programme of infrastructure in the pipeline and stronger economic growth than the countries we usually compare ourselves to. The independent Reserve Bank has room to move on monetary policy – more than many of its counterparts -- and the so-called “automatic stabilisers” will play their part. They include the increased government spending on social support, which in hard times like these helps hold up consumer demand. A floating exchange rate also aids adjustment.The virus is having an impact and while the ultimate extent of that is, of course, unclear we know it will be significant in the short term.Only yesterday we learned that it may have cost as much as $300m in lost exports to China last month and we know it is also having a significant impact on tourism, our log exports and other businesses.That is why we are assessing and preparing for three scenarios. They are not predictions. The World was already coming to the end of an expansionary cycle, and COVID-19 was perhaps a trigger for the international economy, as well as a cause.While New Zealand now has the additional challenge caused by the substantial effects of COVID-19, the underlying objectives of improving productivity, diversifying the mix of our export goods and services and improving market access remain.That is why it is important to maintain the momentum of our efforts to diversify and expand our export markets while showing support for the rules-based order, which is so important to all countries – but especially smaller economies like ours. So far this year I have visited London, Switzerland, Fiji, the United Arab Emirates and, just last week, India after trips to Korea and China late last year, for trade talks with a range of economies, promoting the interests of our exporters and the workers who rely on them.As a Government, we have tried to weight the economy to productive investment through extension of the bright line test on residential property from two to five years, and also through the tax system via a 15 per cent R&D tax credit, which will be extended to pre-profit companies from April 1st. We are making productivity enhancement investments via the Provisional Growth Fund, the Green Investment Fund, and our record additional $12 billion investment in infrastructure – of which $8bn has been committed so far; looks like its counter cyclical timing will be damn near perfect.Measures that’s we’re taking in response to COVID-19 to date include:Expanding the Regional Business Partner programme by investing $4m to help regional partners to support local businesses.Bolstering MSD support with the set-up of Rapid Response Teams. These teams will hone in on the regions most affected by COVID-19 – with an initial focus on the most heavily affected workers, which are in the forestry sector across East Coast, Northland, Taranaki, and Bay of Plenty regions.Last night we convened a meeting of Business NZ, the Council of Trade Unions, and business representatives from affected industries to discuss the ongoing economic response to coronavirus.Common sense changes by Fisheries for our rock lobster industry, allowing release back into the wild to mitigate the impact of cancelled orders from China. Consultation has just closed on possible rock lobster quota carry-over and Cabinet is working through advice on this.$11m tourism package for marketing and support for the most affected areas.Ministry of Primary Industries is directly assisting affected exporters and also holding regular sessions with industry groups.	 We are well aligned with Stephen Toplis’ comments today in regards to what he believes the Government should be doing:- Educate folk about the impending risks- Focus aggressively on bolstering resources going to the health sector- Provide short term assistance to businesses with cash flow difficulties by such means as ensuring government payments to suppliers are timely and offering selective tax holidays- Ensure that folk who lose their jobs, or who can’t attend work for an extended period of time, have access to benefits they are entitled to in a timely fashion- Ensure that the infrastructure of government is maintained. Moving to the announcement we are making today. We are in the midst of a technological revolution with the confluence of global economic developments including the advent of rapidly rising computer power, automatic sensors, robotics, big data, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and genetics.These innovations usually have global application, and will often threaten existing businesses or ways of doing things. New firms and technologies can drive societal change at pace, which we sometimes don’t expect, but the potential upsides born out of this “revolution” are exponential. As Government we would like to maximise New Zealand’s share of these new market opportunities before they are exploited internationally and we experience the law of diminishing returns. There are huge opportunities for New Zealand to harness innovation and to develop the talent and technologies that will create a productive economy – generating economic and also social and environmental benefits.  A focus for the Government has been on the future of work – and enabling all New Zealanders to benefit from new technologies and lifting our productivity through innovation.Fostering innovation by investing in high growth tech savvy firms creates employment and gives New Zealand a competitive edge in global markets.  Ultimately, this raises the country’s productivity and leads to economic growth. To be more productive, sustainable, and inclusive we need to develop new points of comparative advantage, and if we want to develop these new sectors and encourage them to grow, we need to invest in them. Tonight is the realisation of the commitment we made to help bridge the venture capital gap with the $300 million that we announced in last year’s budget. This will increase the commercialisation of technology in New Zealand and lift the level of innovation and productivity across the country.But we also know that the commercialisation of science and the introduction of disruptive innovation and technology tend to require entrepreneurial skills and a business environment that supports these new firms. We have a growing start-up culture: Companies like MARS Bioimaging, who have developed a world-leading colour x-ray which produces clearer and more accurate images that will help doctors give more precise diagnosis all over the world. Or Hamilton agri-tech firm - Innovative Dairy Systems who have developed a machine with the capacity to produce up to eight tonnes of cheese per hour.Or Biolumic – the Palmerston North start-up whose UV technology is now helping to improve crop yields across North America and Europe.However, many of our high-growth early-stage New Zealand entities have historically struggled to access the capital or connections that they need to innovate and expand. Many are forced to delay growth ambitions or seek capital offshore where venture capital funding is significantly more advanced and large pools of capital are available.  This has often led to an increased risk of earlier-than-necessary sell off of New Zealand innovation to offshore interests, with the potential gains to investors and New Zealand being reaped overseas, rather than being recycled back into New Zealand and the next generation of emerging high growth companies. This was especially true in 2009 after the Global Financial Crisis hit. We don’t yet know what the liquidity effects of COVID-19 will be, but the importance of this contribution to venture capital markets may heighten.New Zealand has on average 300 – 500 start-up firms entering what we call the Series A and B investment pipeline. The challenge for these firms is getting the level of funding to scale up and grow.  Assuming natural attrition and failure rates we should expect to see around 40 of these firms securing Series A or B investment.  In reality only half that number secured investment deals in 2018. Over recent years, New Zealand has been averaging around one technology company with a market valuation of a billion dollars-plus a year, with the likes of Xero, Lanzatech and Rocket Lab.  Whilst most won’t be this big, as more capital becomes available we want to see more and more of these new companies emerging, with the resulting positive benefits on New Zealand’s productivity and economic performance.By establishing Elevate New Zealand we are not only supporting New Zealand’s most innovative firms that are looking for investment now, we are stimulating capital available to invest in young techy savvy firms in the future.   By leveraging the existing market credibility of the NZ Growth Capital Partners (NZVIF new name) and the expertise and skills residing in the Guardians of the NZ Super Fund, we are sending a signal to private market investors and institutions that this fund is set up for success. Initially, that success is to increase the venture capital available to high growth entities but ultimately is to develop New Zealand’s venture capital markets to function with less government support.Stimulating New Zealand’s capital markets overall will lift economic performance and contribute to building a productive nation. We are not trying to stop companies selling down overseas. There are many good reasons for doing so. We just don’t want that to be driven by the inadequacy of the NZ market.I must also reflect on the process that got us here tonight. Specifically, I must acknowledge the public submissions on the Venture Capital Act and the separate market consultation on the Policy Statement as this work was invaluable in improving the bill and now fund. Thank you for being part of this. We worked hard to listen to the market, as well as the Guardians and NZ Growth Capital Partners (NZVIF) – as experts in the field. I’m pleased to say that our engagement with the market showed widespread support for this initiative, a fund of funds model, which is a testament to everyone here. Lifting productivity and transitioning our economy is an important part of the Government’s overall economic strategy. Disruptive technologies that shift our economy away from emission-dependant sectors, or that offer innovative ways to use resources less intensely, will be fundamental to a sustainable future. This is another of the pillars of the September 2019 economic plan realised by the Minister of Finance, Grant Robertson. I expect the next wave of sustainable technologies to be supported to commercialisation by venture capital markets. This capital is increasingly raised from New Zealand investors, resulting in a sustainable New Zealand market. Before I finish I want to thank so many people for getting us here today:Matt Whineray, Catherine Savage, and their Guardian’s team Richard Dellabarca, Murray Gribben, and the NZVIF (now NZ Growth Capital Partners) teamLandon McMillan and his team at MBIE and Joe Sant and his team at Treasury for the policy sideThe Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Council, and Peter Beck in particularAnd lastly, to everyone in the room tonight. The whole of industry support and feedback is what got us here tonight. I think we all share the same aim; to improve the standard of living of new Zealanders, through supporting thriving capital markets in New Zealand that are comparable to global counterparts.Thank you for working with us as we work to realise this vision.

2020-02-28T03:28:19Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  PM’s remarks from joint stand-up with PM Morrison,"It’s my pleasure to be in Sydney today for our annual meeting, Prime Minister.It’s fair to say that since we last met, tragedy and disaster have befallen our two countries. They say that in moments of that nature, the true character of an individual comes to the fore.I believe the same can be said of nations too. Australia has proven once again to be the closest of friends to us. The eruption of Whakaari/White Island had a devastating impact, and you lost your own in that tragedy. And yet Prime Minister, you could not have been more supportive. From the offer of specialist staff, the collaboration on incredibly complex medivac operations, right through to the mere fact that those Australian families who lost loved ones still had the heart and extraordinary kindness to send letters back to New Zealand acknowledging the people who had touched them in Whakatane, and that Aotearoa will always be connected to them. I acknowledge too that this tragedy occurred in the back drop of your own, as Australia battled bushfires of such devastating intensity.  New Zealanders were devastated by the scale of what they saw your country experience. There was an incredible desire to help, and during this bushfire season we have contributed 276 firefighting personnel, two emergency management personnel and a number of defence assets, including 139 personnel. As we watched the smoke reach our shores, it only furthered our desire to do everything we could to support Australia, and my message today is that we are only a phone call away - quite literally as PM Morrison and I showed in a recent press conference that he inadvertently dialled into. But these are only recent illustrations of the way we are connected, and the ways we work together.  And Prime Minister we discussed many other ways today. Whether it’s work in the Pacific on climate related issues, boosting the circular economy and improving waste management, coordination and support of one another as we tackle covid-19, our ongoing commitment to make it easier for our businesses to transact with one another - including e-invoicing which is now operational and estimated to save the trans-Tasman economy $30 billion, biosecurity detection or the indigenous collaboration arrangements we signed today. Each of these initiatives is grounded in that history we have, and that friendship that we value. But friendships aren’t just reaffirmed in times of tragedy, they must stand up to the test of politics. And in the face of politics, the New Zealand and Australia relationship is being tested.We appreciate that many kiwis have taken up the opportunity to live and work in Australia - many more than has happened in reverse. Not every kiwi migrant will be perfect, but evidence shows that the vast majority are providing a net benefit to Australia. They earn more, are more likely to be employed and pay more tax than their Aussie-born counterparts - they are Australia’s best migrants. But rather than them being given security to keep contributing, in return their rights have been eroded. Simple rights, like assistance from the national disability insurance scheme - even though they pay into the scheme’s levy. Or the ability to join the defence force, or become a federal civil servant. Kiwis want to contribute to the place that is now their home. But they’re not being given the potential to do that to the fullest.Separate again is the issue of deportations. Australia is well within its rights to deport individuals who break your laws. New Zealand does the same. But we have a simple request. Send back kiwis, genuine kiwis - do not deport your people, and your problems. I have heard countless cases of individuals who, on any common sense test, identify as Australians. Just a few weeks ago I met a women who moved to Australia not much older than 1 year old. She told me that she had no connection to our country, but she had three children in Australia. She was in a crisis centre, having returned to a country she did not feel was her own. I have heard from those who work in our judiciary that they are seeing cases before our courts of individuals who are failing attempts to reintegrate and rehabilitate because the success of these programs is reliant on at least some network. These deportees have none.I am not asking that Australia stops this policy- you have deported more than 2000 individuals and amongst them will be genuine kiwis who do have to learn the consequences of their actions. But amongst those 2000 are individuals who were too young to become criminals on our watch. They were too young to become patched gang members. Too young to be organised criminals. We will own our people. We ask that Australia stop exporting theirs. I want to conclude by just reaffirming something I have said often before - we will continue to maintain rights for Australians in New Zealand. We do not wish to have a race to the bottom and we remain confident that by continuing to work together, we will find solutions that reaffirm just how important this relationship is to us. Finally again PM Morrison, thank you for the chance again today to discuss the issues that are important to each of us. I have no other leader that I can confidently work so closely together with - and that has proven so important in our darkest of hours. May we look forward to better times ahead."
2020-02-26T23:58:39Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Grant Robertson                    ,  NZ economy in strong position to respond to coronavirus,"Prepared remarks on coronavirus by Finance Minister Grant Robertson to the Auckland Chamber of Commerce and Massey University.Good morning ladies and gentlemen,The topic of this speech is the Budget 2020 priorities. But, given the considerable interest that I imagine is in the room about COVID-19 coronavirus, I do want to make some comments about that first.Because we do meet today in the shadow of one of the biggest uncertainties that the global economy has seen in recent times.This is a rapidly changing situation that the world finds itself in. This week we have seen stock markets react to news of the virus spreading. Just overnight, the World Health Organisation reported there were more new cases recorded outside China than inside it.I am going to spend a bit of time outlining what we are doing to respond to coronavirus, and how we are planning for a range of scenarios so that we are prepared and able to support the New Zealand economy as the global impact of the virus becomes clearer.First and foremost, our response to coronavirus must be led by our responsibility to protect the health and wellbeing of our people. That is why our first response has been a public health response.The Ministry of Health has done significant work over recent years on our pandemic planning and response. That means we are in a position to deploy that plan if this virus outbreak spreads and cases reach New Zealand.The Ministry is working closely with DHBs, public health units, general practitioners and other health providers, including holding daily teleconferences on emerging issues.The Prime Minister earlier this week set out some of that work. This includes even the level of detail of having 9 million P2 masks, and 9 million general purpose surgical masks available. We’ve initiated an intensive care network of clinical ICU directors. We’ve undertaken a national stocktake from DHBs, which shows that we can deploy new staff across ICUs and high-dependency unit beds around the country.We have access to negative pressure rooms across 15 DHBs, and New Zealand has the ability to test for the virus in Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington, with same-day turnaround.As you know, we’ve also put in place the travel ban on people who have left or transited through mainland China in the previous 14 days. We continue to review that ban every 48 hours, including taking into account the spread of the virus to other countries.Public health staff are at our international airports, providing advice and information, and they are available to undertake health assessments of passengers.That information includes guidance on self-isolation. Since early February there have been more than 5,000 registrations of people in self-isolation. I want to take a moment here to thank New Zealanders for showing that kind of responsibility.Healthline has established a dedicated phone line for coronavirus information – 0800 358 5453.It is, of course, welcome that we have not yet had a case of coronavirus in New Zealand. The advice from health experts is that, with an outbreak of this type, it remains a high probability that we will have a case at some point. But I want to congratulate our public health officials on their response. What it has done is buy us some time to prepare ourselves should a case arrive.Beyond the public health response, we are taking a whole-of-government approach to managing the outbreak and planning for further scenarios.A key part of this is our planning for the economic impacts of the virus.As we do this, we know that this Government’s economic plan has been strengthening and growing the economy, even in the face of the global headwinds we have faced over the past two years, like the US-China trade war and Brexit uncertainty.We go into this situation with the economy in good shape. We are in a strong position to stand up to the economic and health impacts of coronavirus.Looking across fiscal and monetary policy, our labour market, consumer and business confidence readings and our housing market, the economy showed solid signs of improvement in late 2019.The Government’s accounts for the first six months of the fiscal year – to the end of December 2019 – were strong. We had a surplus over the first six months of our fiscal year and we’re sitting $500 million higher than expected due to the stronger economy. This is on top of the $12 billion of surpluses in our first two years in Government. Tax revenue, including corporate tax and GST, were running ahead of forecast – highlighting the underlying strength of our businesses and our economy.Just yesterday, the New Zealand Institute for Economic Research reported how the fundamentals of the economy are still strong, saying “there is underlying momentum in the economy”. This was off the back of higher consumer and business confidence, and following the announcement of the Government’s significant infrastructure plans, which will boost domestic economic activity.We go into this with our unemployment rate having ticked down to 4%. Just last week, Australia’s rate ticked up to 5.3%.We go into this with our official interest rate higher than many other advanced economies – our Reserve Bank’s OCR at 1% is above Australia and the UK at 0.75%, and there are negative rates across Europe.We go into this with very low Government debt compared to the rest of the world. Credit ratings agency Moody’s recently reported that New Zealand’s Government debt position is significantly lower than other countries with its top Aaa rating.And we go into this situation off the back of our Government’s announcement of additional infrastructure investment in roads, rail, schools and hospitals under the New Zealand Upgrade Programme. We are investing to support, grow and modernise our economy.New Zealand is in a strong position to respond to the impacts of coronavirus.We are operating in an environment of high uncertainty. It is not possible for anyone at this stage to give definitive answers to significant questions, such as: How long will it last? What will the global reach be? How deep will the impact be felt?But while we look for answers for those questions, we can say some things with certainty.This will have a serious impact on the New Zealand economy in the short term.It is clear that there is an immediate impact on the tourism industry, particularly given there are now very few flights between China and New Zealand.Chinese tourists typically spend around $180 million per month in the peak travel months of January through to April.Within education exports, our tertiary sector has been impacted due to foreign students not travelling. The estimates we have are that around 40% of students have not been able to travel here.That’s why we are working closely with our tertiary education sector to see what they can do to make sure New Zealanders’ public health isn’t put at risk if the travel ban is lifted for students.It is obvious that if the docks in China are shut down because workers are not able to get to work, then this will impact New Zealand’s log and food exports. Although I will add that we are starting to hear reports of some shipments getting through. Chinese authorities are also prioritising food shipments into China, which is positive for a country like New Zealand.We also know that the supply chain disruption in China is having some effects here in New Zealand, where domestic companies rely on imports from China that are not moving at this time.Very early, we began speaking to industry groups about how we could help them respond to the initial impacts of coronavirus.This week, Minister Davis and I held a meeting with leaders from the tourism industry regarding the $11 million fund we set up to help identify new markets and opportunities as visitor numbers from China remain low due to the public health travel ban.At that meeting we agreed to establish a tourism industry advisory group to ensure a continuous flow of information between the industry and the Government.We also agreed on the importance of working together to rebuild the Chinese market from a New Zealand Inc. point of view once restrictions are lifted.In terms of Government departments, MSD and IRD are working closely with affected businesses and individuals to make sure they receive the support they need. The most recent numbers show the IRD has spoken directly with more than 100 businesses to give them advice and support.An MBIE website at business.govt.nz has been set up as a dedicated resource for businesses to source information about a range of potential issues like where exporters can go for assistance, implications for landlords and tenants, issues around tax obligations and questions around planning for travel. As of yesterday, there had been 45,000 hits on the site – so it’s good to see information flowing between Government and businesses.Minister Stuart Nash moved quickly to help our live rock lobster industry with a set of common sense changes to rules that he oversees to help them manage their stocks after it became difficult to export to China.Economic impactIt is important to keep in mind that this outbreak will end, just as we saw with other outbreaks like SARS. The question is a matter of, when that will be?New Zealand’s economy is in a strong position to respond to coronavirus. We are well prepared to respond to a range of scenarios that could play out.Current analysis of the economic impacts of coronavirus from various forecasters has focussed on a scenario where the virus is contained and there is a short, sharp impact on the global economy in the first half of 2020, before activity returns to normal levels.Over the weekend, the IMF downgraded its China growth forecast for 2020 from 6% to 5.6% under a scenario which assumes the spread of the virus is contained. The impact on global growth from this would take it from 3.3% in 2020 to 3.2%.The OECD publishes its next set of interim forecasts next week, which will contain further updates.The IMF’s Managing Director did say they are looking at further scenarios where the spread of the virus continued for longer, was more global, and had more protracted global growth consequences.This is similar to what we are doing here in New Zealand, through an Economic Advisory Group led by the Treasury and including the Reserve Bank and MBIE.Through this, we are assessing three scenarios: Scenario one predicts a temporary global demand shock where we experience a temporary but significant impact on the New Zealand economy across the first half of 2020, before growth rebounds in the second half as exports return to normal.The second scenario is based on a longer lasting shock to the domestic economy, as the global impact feeds through to the economy for a period of time, and where there are cases in New Zealand, and,The third scenario is planning for how to respond to a global downturn if the worst case plays out around the world, and we have a global pandemic.We believe it is sensible and responsible to plan for these multiple scenarios. It does not mean we are predicting them. But it means we can continue to act swiftly and decisively as the impacts of coronavirus on the global and domestic economies become clearer, so that we can support Kiwis and New Zealand businesses.This week NZIER released a piece of research showing they expect a “short, sharp shock”, with the effects expected to be temporary – in line with what I’ve outlined in scenario one, where containment works.But it is important to note that NZIER said that if its assumption around containment does not hold, then there would likely be a larger impact on export demand, meaning weaker GDP growth in the New Zealand economy.This is a rapidly changing situation that the world is in. You would have seen this week global stock markets reacting as new reports about outbreaks in places like Italy, South Korea and Iran hit the headlines.This does raise questions around whether the first scenario – that there will be a short, sharp impact over the first half of 2020 before activity returns to normal – will play out, or whether we are already heading to the second scenario where there are longer-run impacts.Our officials here are actively monitoring this situation, drawing on all data and analyses that they can to adjust our assumptions and forecasts. This includes administrative data that might provide more timely signals than traditional economic indicators which are reported with a lag. It also includes high-frequency data from China that economic analysts around the world are keeping tabs on – ranging from coal consumption to air pollution levels and traffic jams in Chinese cities to monitor activity there.We are in a good position to handle the situation, however it develops.The second scenario we are planning for has the domestic economy experiencing a longer period of slower growth – across the whole of 2020 – as a result of the global effects of coronavirus. Under this scenario, global uncertainty about the worldwide spread and containment of the virus causes deeper impacts on directly exposed sectors, as our trading partners feel the effects of coronavirus.We would expect to experience a decline in visitor arrivals from other markets outside of the temporary travel ban due to the economic impact that the virus has in other countries – like what we’re seeing now with South Korea.These external effects lead to broader indirect impacts across the domestic economy, with business and consumer confidence falling and the subsequent impact on investment and spending decisions.I do want to also briefly talk about scenario three. Effectively, scenario three is one where the virus outbreak becomes a global pandemic that in turn creates a global downturn or even a global recession. In such circumstances it may be necessary to consider immediate fiscal stimulus to support the economy as a whole and businesses and individuals through this period.I hasten to add that we are not predicting this scenario. But we are doing the planning for it. I also remind you that these scenarios are all temporary. The effects of this virus will pass.We are in a strong position to handle these scenarios. We have low public debt. We have been running budget surpluses, and we have forecast budget surpluses because we’re managing the Government’s books carefully. We know that Kiwi businesses are performing well, as we see record-low unemployment numbers, a greater proportion of small businesses with positive cash flows, and higher-than-forecast corporate tax revenue.The automatic stabilisers will also kick in:In this scenario, the New Zealand dollar is likely to depreciate, which will help our exporters. The Reserve Bank has noted publically that it has room to move if the situation deteriorates – and it is worth remembering that they have greater room to move than most of their peers.MSD is already actively on the ground assisting workers in the forestry and logging sectors, while IRD is actively in discussions with businesses about provisional tax arrangements.These and other Government agencies are set to step up their efforts as needed. I have asked the Treasury to provide further specific policy interventions for each scenario.As we move through our planning and response as a Government, I also urge New Zealand’s banks and their customers to sit down together and talk through their plans for managing the impacts of the virus on their business.And also for businesses to talk with their staff about any adjustments that might be necessary.Because we are all in this together.We are lucky in New Zealand that we are able to move swiftly and decisively due to our careful economic management.Our management of the Government’s books means we have the room to support the economy further through targeted Government investment. You’ve already seen examples of sector-based initiatives that we’ve been able to get underway quickly, in tourism and fisheries.Further sector-specific initiatives are able to be rolled out to support businesses and New Zealanders through this period if the second scenario that we are planning for does play out.We are also at a stage in the 2020 Budget process where we can consider the policies required if we need a greater response.So, in summary, we are continuing to focus on protecting the health of New Zealanders and we are taking a public health approach to our response to coronavirus. At the same time we are undertaking whole-of-Government planning, working with sectors and industries to ensure we respond as this situation evolves.We have the capacity and ability to do what it takes."

NamasteThank you Shamima, Hon. Minister Vuniwaqa, community leaders and Women’s Crisis Centre staff for your warm welcome. It’s an honour and privilege to officially open your new premises today. I am delighted to be part of the celebrations and to personally acknowledge the critical support services you provide to women and their families at their most vulnerable. Whilst it is tragic that our societies and our nations continue to require services to protect women and girls from violence and abuse, today, we pay tribute to the impact that the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre has had, and will continue to have, in improving the lives of thousands of Fijian women. In opening the Nadi centre this morning, I’d like to acknowledge the origins of the Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre. It began as a grassroots organisation, established by women, who came together out of concern for the impact of violence in their communities. From those humble beginnings, fast forward 35+ years, and FWCC is still stepping up to support Fijian women in crisis, as well as providing training and advocacy services for Pacific women more broadly through the Pacific Network to End Violence Against Women. Today I’d like to thank those pioneering women who championed and established the Centre, for their vision and determination in creating a movement for change. In particular I would like to acknowledge FWCC’s coordinator Shamima Ali, whom as we know has been the key architect of FWCC’s development since the very beginning. On behalf of many thousands of women, Shamima, we honour you and the difference you are making in the world. What a legacy you have built in promoting women’s rights as human’s rights.Thank you also to the many women, and men, involved in supporting and delivering the services of the Nadi Women’s Crisis Centre. You should be very proud of how you are serving your community. Thank you for your manaakitanga in hosting me this morning.New Zealand has shared an enduring relationship with Fiji Women’s Crisis Centre, as a key supporter of your movement since the 1990s. We are proud of this association and our continued commitment, in partnership with the Government of Australia, to support FWCC’s endeavours to ultimately break the cycle of violence. I must also acknowledge with respect and admiration the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation and Minister Mereseini Vuniwaqa on your commitment to tackling violence against women and girls through the development of a National Action Plan. Fiji is the first Pacific Island country to adopt an all-of-government approach to preventing violence against women and girls, grounded in strong, evidence-based policy. This national approach to address the root causes of gender based violence through policy action will further support the mandate and impact of civil society partners such as FWCC.2020 is the fifth anniversary of the Sustainable Development Goals, with ten years until their culmination. Whilst Goal Five focuses on gender, the fact is that women’s equality and empowerment is integral to all dimensions of inclusive and sustainable development. In short all the SDGs depend on the achievement of gender equality. The call to action for gender equality and women’s empowerment is therefore even more urgent and remains one of the most pressing development issues in the Pacific. Developing strong Pacific positions on key areas related to gender equality and women’s empowerment continues to be critical to ensuring the voice of the Pacific is heard on the international stage.At the bilateral level, New Zealand and Fiji’s principles and approach to gender equality and women’s empowerment are aligned. Last year we saw this alignment translate into real partnership with the preparation for the Beijing +25 Platform for Action Review and the 64th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. I am delighted to see our cooperation with Fiji increasing via our new partnership with the Ministry of Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation. This partnership will support the role of the Ministry as the Government of Fiji’s core policy coordinating unit for promoting gender equality in Fiji, and will contribute to the development of the National Action Plan. It will also enable other in kind support to develop deeper linkages with New Zealand’s Ministry of Women. I have great faith, like those pioneering women who founded FWCC, that together, we can address gender inequality and improve social and economic outcomes for girls and women in Fiji. I will leave you with a proverb from the indigenous people of New Zealand – the Maori: Me aro koe ki te hā o Hineahuone Pay heed to the dignity of womenI’d like to think that’s what this centre’s mission is all about. Vinaka vakalevu. "

As we approach the first anniversary of the terror attack in Christchurch against New Zealand’s Muslim community, we are filled with deep emotion. I want to remember Fiji’s own sons killed in this tragedy: Imam Hafiz Musa PatelAshraf Ali RazatAshraf AliThey were yours. And now they are part of us. Our love goes out to their family and friends, and to all of you, their Muslim brothers and sisters who have been left with painful memories to this day. While I will never know your pain, I carry with me many memories from that day, and the days that followed. I still recall visiting the hall where the day after the attack hundreds of members of the Muslim community gathered.Amongst them was Mrs Patel. I still remember talking with you that day as you desperately looked for your husband, your Imam. I remember talking with you as you retraced your steps and feeling pained as I handed you over to a member of the Red Cross to continue to support you and to assist you. In your darkest of hours I can tell you that I will never forget that grief I saw that day. I would also like to acknowledge having just met Ashraf’s family and his grandson, and I acknowledge that you have lost a mentor and friend. But please know that New Zealand now carries him in their hearts and that you have a home in New Zealand now too. I want to acknowledge Hafiz Khan and the Fiji Muslim League. Thank you for bringing us together in memory of those who lost their lives. As-salaam alaikum.Today is very important to us as New Zealanders. We wanted to be here today to thank you all in person, to thank you for being friends to New Zealand, to thank you for your understanding and support, and to acknowledge the important ties between Fiji’s Muslim community and the Muslim community in New Zealand. They existed before, they exist even more strongly now.I want to place on record our deep appreciation for the many messages of support and sympathy we received from Fiji following the March 15 attacks. It gave us strength to know that you stood in solidarity with us. And you sent those messages so swiftly. You were amongst the first. But it was especially moving to receive those messages knowing that you faced your own grief. When I attended a memorial service soon after the attacks, I felt lost for words – I had been so moved by the generosity of the Islamic faith. In this time of great pain mosques were opened by the community and we were met with a simple greeting: as-salaam alaikum. Peace be upon you. In the face of hate and violence, the Muslim community in New Zealand – and around the world – had every right to express pain and to express anger. Instead they chose love. Instead they chose to open their hearts for all of us to grieve with them and with you. Instead you chose to open your arms and embrace us. Instead you chose to comfort us as we sought to comfort you, and that was captured by the simple words: as-salaam alaikum. Peace be upon you.Those words humbled – and united – us as a country, at a time when an attack struck against our core values. An attack that was malicious, and racially and ideologically motivated. Today I want to talk about our commitment to working to ensure these attacks never happen again. Our commitment to eradicate the underlying drivers and ideology of such cowardly attacks. Our commitment to promoting the values that Fiji and New Zealand share – those of kindness and compassion. Championing those values must sit at core of our efforts to counter violent extremism. Combatting violent extremismBut we also know we that have a duty to take on the very tangible threats that existed and enabled this attack to occur in our home. The terrorist attack in Christchurch it did expose weaknesses for instance in our gun legislation. A week after the attack, we announced a ban on all military style semi-automatic weapons – like the one used in the attack – removing them from our communities. Within a month, both sides of New Zealand’s Parliament had united to effect this ban.The attack was also designed to weaponise the internet, to capitalise on an underbelly of online racism and hate. I have said before: we cannot confront these sorts of issues alone, none of us can. And so we united. Immediately after the attack, we reached out. We worked with France to develop the Christchurch Call. A call to action to eliminate terrorist and violent extremist content online – through collaboration between countries, tech companies and civil society. Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right. It is one that New Zealand protects, fiercely. But no one has the right to create and share terrorist and violent extremist content online. This call to action is now supported by 48 countries, three international organisations and eight online service providers.The Call is also a sign of our sense of responsibility – to honour the victims of the attacks and those like it, and to try to prevent this from ever happening again.But we don’t have to be politicians, or in positions of power, to honour those we lost in our thoughts and in our actions. Immediately after the attacks, Prime Minister Bainimarama called on all Fijians across all backgrounds and faiths to join him in making a pledge: where ever you are and wherever you encounter someone who says something racist or hateful, whether it is online or in person, say something. He said, ""Be the voice of love. Be the voice of change.""Social inclusionAnd so too do we carry that responsibly – to look to work as a nation to address the root causes of intolerance to build resilient, inclusive communities able to resist those hateful ideologies. Our approach ultimately revolves around a simple concept that is not bound by borders, that isn’t based on ethnicity, political or legal power, or even forms of governance. It lies in our common humanity.In New Zealand, we value and celebrate diversity. We are a nation of 200 ethnicities, 160 languages. Many of you, perhaps all of you, have family or connection in New Zealand. We celebrate diversity and inclusiveness. We pride ourselves on being open and peaceful. But we reflected deeply on the fact that March 15, that terror attack, happened in our country. Despite that celebration of diversity, we still have work to do to strengthen New Zealand society. We are not perfect. That means thinking about how we can build an inclusive society, one in which diversity doesn’t just exist but is valued. A place in which we break down the walls of “otherness” and instil in everyone a pride in being a New Zealander and what that means. It means building societies that are inclusive of all religions, races, gender, and where all cultures have a place, human rights are upheld, and so are New Zealand’s values of kindness, fairness and compassion.ConclusionI remain ever confident, ever optimistic, ever hopeful that countering violent extremism – with inclusion and basic humanity at its core – is the most effective way to prevent the tragedy of the Christchurch terror attack ever happening again. As we strive to create a society in this vein, we will take lessons from the Muslim community in New Zealand who, in the face of such brutal violence, helped New Zealand respond with compassion. We will remember your powerful greeting: as-salaam alaikum. Peace be upon you.And so too will we remember the words spoken by the first Māori King more than 150 years ago: “Kotahi te kohao o te ngira e kuhuna ai te miro ma, te miro pango, te miro whero.” “There is but one eye of the needle through which the white, red and black threads must pass.”It speaks about a piece of Māori artwork called the tukutuku and the process of weaving different coloured threads together. Individual threads can be weak but woven together, they make a strong and beautiful piece. That is the beauty of diversity and the beauty of unity. May we never forget that. And may we never forget those we have lost. As-salaam alaikumVinaka vakalevu. Thank you.   "
2020-02-26T12:23:48Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Winston Peters                    ,  The Indo-Pacific: from principles to partnerships,"Speech to the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA)Delhi, IndiaWednesday 26 February 2020[CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY]The Indo-Pacific: from principles to partnershipsDistinguished guests, good afternoon and thank you for your invitation.  It is good to be here at a time where New Zealand needs less of an introduction than might usually be the case.   The many millions of Indian cricket fans who have watched your team tour our country over the past two months will know all too well that New Zealand is geographical remote from your country.  But the reality is that our two countries are closer and more connected than you might think. The most dynamic link between us is in our population. Those of you who have spent the past few days watching the first test from Wellington will have seen the reality of this first-hand. The thousands and thousands of Indian faces in the Basin Reserve crowd are as likely to have been cheering for Ajaz Patel and the Black Caps as for Virat Kohli and the visitors.     Five percent of New Zealand’s people now identifies as being of Indian origin: that’s one in every twenty New Zealands. Hindi is our fifth most spoken language. That diaspora has made seriously impressive achievements across all parts of New Zealand society. Indian New Zealanders have made prominent contributions in all fields of endeavour: from business to the judiciary; politics to sport. Indian New Zealanders are represented in our national Parliament, with three current sitting MPs and a number of others having served at one point in time in nearly every major political party. Two of our Indian origin MPs, one present and one former, are part of our delegation on this trip - Priyanca Radakrishnan and Mahesh Bindra.The most accomplished of Indian New Zealanders include Sir Anand Satyanand, a renowned jurist and former governor general of New Zealand, who has been honoured formally by the governments of both our countries; and Dame Sukhi Turner, the first Indian New Zealander elected mayor of a major New Zealand city.  Our common status as democracies is another important connection.  India is the world’s largest democracy. Less well known is that New Zealand is among the world’s oldest, with an unbroken democratic record dating back more than one hundred and sixty five years. Just as Indians rightly feel proud of your historic “tryst with destiny” in 1947; New Zealanders are also singularly proud of one of our own constitutional firsts – the first country where women achieved the vote in 1893. Our history and traditions have shaped us both: legacies of indigenous populations and immigration, now with modern governments leading diverse populations. From our shared Commonwealth heritage we have inherited an array of familiar parliamentary conventions and traditions.   Democracies can be untidy and unwieldy.  Democracy is, as has famously been observed, the worst system of government apart from all others that have been tried from time to time. At their heart, democracies derive their strength from the sovereignty and consent of individual voters. It is a system which for decades has underpinned peace and order in both our countries as well as delivering profound growth and development.Our democratic traditions have also underpinned how we engage with the world.  Our systems, grounded in the sovereignty of the individual and the rule of law, instinctively desire the same things for sovereign nations. And it is precisely from our democratic status and values that we derive our credibility, trust and influence in world affairs.  Of course, we have had our differences, which have always been respectfully if robustly expressed.  One thing our foreign policies share in abundance is a stubborn independent streak.  For both of us, this tends to manifest in strong support for international law and the UN charter; in the expectation of a voice at decision-making tables relevant to our interests; and in the support of peace, development and multilateralism which is grounded in respect for the sovereignty of states.The geographical differences between us are immediately evident.  Yet with the emergence of the Indo-Pacific as a strategic concept we find ourselves increasingly linked by what we have in common.  At its heart, the Indo-Pacific is maritime.  And we are both responsible for vast areas of great Oceans on which our security and prosperity depend.  For India, 95 percent of your trade by volume and well over half your energy is transported via the Indian Ocean.  For New Zealand, the Pacific Ocean is likewise vital to our strategic interests and fundamental to our identity.   Our great oceans also face similar strategic challenges, with growing pressure on multiple fronts. Economic resilience, distance to market, and creating employment opportunities remain a real challenge for island states in both oceans. Human development, particularly health and education for remote populations, are key areas where government services are often stretched. Transnational crime is putting pressure on law enforcement agencies across the region. Climate change continues to have a major impact on our regions, as coasts erode, rivers salinate, sea levels rise, and fish stocks decline. In addition, strategic competition is at levels that we have not seen for decades. Like India, New Zealand has direct interests in the Indo-Pacific’s security:We trade with the world. Our defence interests include our contribution over more than 70 years to the security of the seas and the capacity of all to use them.  In the Pacific, our Search and Rescue area stretches over 1/6th of the world’s surface, from the Equator to Antarctica.  And our various naval deployments in the Gulf of Aden over the past ten years underline the contribution New Zealand has also made in the Indian Ocean.  New Zealanders travel to every part of the world and we welcome people from all over the world to our country.  This brings enormous benefits, but also risks, as the ongoing coronavirus outbreak continues to underscore.The terrorist attacks in India and New Zealand in February and March last year, and the Easter terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, were stark reminders that no country is disconnected from poisonous extremist ideologies or their appalling consequences.  Like India, our massive Ocean interests expose us to the most pressing security and development concerns of Island countries.  Eclipsing all of these is the threat of climate change, which has been identified by Pacific Leaders as the number one threat to Pacific peoples. The emergence of the Indo-Pacific terminology recognises these common interests. It unites New Zealand and India in a shared strategic geography as well as a shared commitment to a stable, peaceful, open and secure region.   This is reflected in the alignment of our Indo-Pacific policies. Like many in the region we welcomed Prime Minister Modi’s remarks to the Shangri La dialogue in 2018 where he affirmed India’s commitment to a “free, open, and inclusive” Indo-Pacific region – one based on the consent of all, not on the power of the few” and characterized by respect for international law, including freedom of navigation and overflight.  New Zealand’s own Indo-Pacific policy echoes and endorses these principles.   Like India, we also want to see an Indo-Pacific that is open and inclusive; that is committed to transparency; that respects sovereignty; that adheres to international law; that upholds freedoms of overflight and navigation; where markets are open; and that is grounded in ASEAN centrality.   We also know that safeguarding these principles and responding to the security concerns of our region will require collective action. New Zealand has welcomed ASEAN’s release of its Indo-Pacific Outlook, which has reaffirmed ASEAN’s role as a regional convenor at the geographical centre of the region. And we are seeking to reaffirm and reinvigorate our strategic partnership with ASEAN, building on our legacy as its second-oldest dialogue partner. We work closely together in ASEAN’s architecture, especially at the East Asia Summit.  India’s stated commitment to a proactive and stabilising leadership role in this region is therefore both appropriate and welcome.  The visit this week by President Trump has underlined New Delhi’s role as a centre of global discussion and active participation in mediating an evolving world order.  India’s convening power was also demonstrated in the last month with the latest iteration of the Raisina Dialogue. A forum which brings perspectives from the region and the world. New Zealand’s perspective is unsurprisingly concentrated in the Pacific. Just as the Indian Ocean matters hugely to India, the Pacific matters hugely to New Zealand.  It is where we wield the most influence, and where we can have the most positive impact. New Zealand’s foreign policy update, our Pacific Reset, has as its long-term goal a stable, prosperous and resilient Pacific. Our policy approach recognised the complexities of the Pacific context: the asymmetries at play in a time when larger players are renewing their interest; the attendant element of strategic competition; and the speed and intensity of the interests at play.  We have operationalised this through significant increases in development assistance; strengthening and broadening our diplomatic footprint; a new defence policy statement and the procurement of new maritime surveillance capabilities to promote regional security, while also contributing to reinforcing the international rules-based order. But alongside increasing our investment and ambition, our approach has been grounded in maturing our partnerships with Pacific Island Countries to support their independence and sustainable social and economic resilience. We have ‘reset’.  But there is much more to be done, and so we must also look ahead. We need to continue to encourage best practice and transparency in development cooperation, and ensure that the geopolitical environment does not detract from Pacific priorities, or risk regional security. We need to keep working on deepening political partnerships across the region and with other partners. Our partners often look to us, for insight, collaboration, and cooperation on engaging in the Pacific context. Above all, we need to put our principles into action, maintaining the ethos of partnership and respect that has underpinned New Zealand’s engagement to date.  We encourage others to listen and respond to the priorities of Pacific partners when engaging in the Pacific.  And we are committed to showing the same respect for other partners’ sovereignty and priorities when we engage with them in other parts of the Indo-Pacific.  We know India seeks to take a similar approach.  In that context, New Zealand welcomes India’s commitment to the Pacific Islands region. We recognise India’s long-standing cultural, historical and human ties across the region and its contribution to Pacific security priorities.  This includes India’s signing on to the Paris Agreement and its determination to increase investment in renewable energy and solar power generation in the Pacific, as reflected in Prime Minister Modi’s undertakings to Pacific leaders.  That contribution underlines the leadership role India can play across the region.  New Zealand wants to see India take a greater role in international political structures that support global security and regional economic governance.New Zealand has supported India’s bid for a permanent seat in a restructured UN Security Council. But we also see commensurate leadership responsibility in respect of global economic governance. Threats to the rules-based multilateral trading system should concern us all.  New Zealand has been active in supporting WTO reform efforts – but we need all countries to engage in these to preserve the stability and predictability that has been critical to our shared economic prosperity and security.  In the same way, we remain committed to building the economic architecture required for the Indo-Pacific.  New Zealand spent great diplomatic and political effort in ensuring that the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans Pacific Partnership was completed.  In doing so, its members have reaped significant benefits.  We therefore also strongly encourage India to become a full participant in the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).  New Zealand respects India’s wish to seriously consider the terms of its engagement.  But the blunt reality is that India’s absence from the region’s economic architecture is in neither our economic nor our strategic interests.  We want India to be a foundation member of a rules-based grouping committed to regional trade and development.  And if India wishes to be a key player in the region, securing an enduring and influential voice in the region’s economic and trade architecture will be essential.   Building on our shared interests is already showing promise. In addition to the alignment of our Indo-Pacific policies, our visit here will support a number of practical outcomes.  This includes an Air Services Agreement; enhanced customs cooperation; a commitment to greater collaboration in multilateral forums such as the UN Security Council and various business deals underlining the economic connectivity between our countries. But there is more we can do in the wider relationship. That’s why, as part of our visit here, we are launching a refreshed New Zealand – India strategy for investing in the relationship.  As our remarks today have underlined, we have an excellent foundation on which to build. The strategic reality of our shared Indo-Pacific region reinforces that New Zealand and India are closer than we might think and that we are embarked on a shared journey.  Thank you.[ENDS]  "

But then after that fairly heavy topic I’m going to answer your questions. And please do ask anything you would like. But first a little bit about me and where I come from, and how where I came from in many ways got me here I grew up in two small towns in New Zealand.  I’m talking something like 3000 people, so not quite island small, but small enough. It was living in a town called Murupara that taught me about inequality. In the 1980s and 1990s New Zealand went through a rapid period of privatisation and economic liberalisation. It was called Rogernomics after the Finance Minister of the time. Factories shut, jobs were lost.Welfare cuts for the poorest meant support for people shrunk. The gap between those with a lot and those with very little got a lot bigger.Now I was a child and a teenage when all this was going on, but I remember it. And I especially remember the impact it had on children. I built my social conscience as a school girl. My first value was fairness and my first dislike was injustice.So, when I became Prime Minister I made myself the Minister for Child Poverty Reduction – because I wanted to right those wrongs I saw growing up as a child.Those first injustices that I saw, I now want to remedy. And I want to install fairness and kindness as guiding values of good government, because frankly individualism and the politics of fear have failed us.  So those are my founding values. And my question today to you is what are yours? What injustices do you see before you that you will hold with you and seek to change? Because the New Zealand I lead today is different to the one I grew up in. And the Pacific you lead tomorrow will be different to the one you currently inhabit, so how do you want to shape it? And what is it about our Pacific character that can help shape new solutions?Because as a Pacific family we are facing some very real challenges – challenges I know deeply impact many people in this room.But these are not challenges you experience on your own, they are shared.New Zealand is a Pacific country; we share history, culture, politics, family and rugby sevens. As part of the Pacific family we are deeply conscious that our identity, our security and our prosperity are inextricably linked to yours. We have, in a very genuine sense, a shared Pacific future, perhaps more now than ever before.Climate change continues to have a significant impact on the people of the region, as coasts erode, sea levels rise, and fish stocks move. I know this is not hypothetical here, but a reality. As it is in the places I have seen with my own eyes – Tuvalu, Tokelau, Samoa. Each have a story. Add to that the challenge of economic resilience, distance to market, and creating employment opportunities.But with perhaps the exception of the climate crisis these challenges are not new. But what is new is the ever increasing global interest in the Pacific region, in your home. Pacific Island leaders last year noted that – alongside the impact of climate change – increasing strategic competition was exacerbating our region’s particular vulnerabilities.That serves to highlight why now more than ever our Pacific values must rise to the fore – cooperation. We here in the Pacific have long known that we are so much stronger and so much more effective, when we speak with one voice and act as a region both here and out into the world. Last year, as leaders, we highlighted the importance of maintaining regional solidarity and encouraging engagement in the region that aligns with and supports Pacific priorities and values. How else do we maintain our voice our strength and our focus. And so here and now I am recommitting New Zealand to supporting and investing in Pacific regionalism. After all, what happens in New Zealand, or Fiji, or anywhere else in the Pacific affects us all. The artificial lines between what we call domestic policy and international policy are just that – artificial. When we’re trying to address issues such as climate change, or infectious diseases, or trans-national crime, borders do not matter – these are borderless challenges and they demand a collective response. And thankfully collectivism and cooperation, listening and understanding one another’s needs – it’s the Pacific way. That’s why under the auspices of the Pacific Islands Forum, leaders have called for the development of a 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific to provide a long-term vision of what we want to achieve together for the region.  And that’s also why at the last Pacific Island Forum leaders issued the strongest collective statement on climate change that we’ve ever released. It recognises that there is no greater priority than the need to address the impacts of climate change. And it’s why New Zealand announced at the Pacific Islands Forum last August a $150 million package for Pacific-focused climate change assistance, as part of a wider commitment to invest at least $300 million globally in climate-related assistance over the next three years. Out of that $150 million, we have already approved projects worth $98 million in areas such as water security and invasive species. Today, I am pleased to announce that New Zealand is making under this programme a $2 million dedicated investment in supporting Fiji to manage one of the most confronting issues that climate change has already brought – the displacement of communities.  While we must do all we can to mitigate and prevent the full frontal assault of climate change we must also prepare, and that’s exactly what’s happening here in Fiji. We are contributing to the establishment of Fiji’s Climate Relocation and Displaced Peoples Trust Fund for Communities and Infrastructure, launched in September – a world first initiative that aims to sustainably and sensitively manage the relocation of Fiji’s communities. With five community relocations under way or completed in Fiji and a further forty identified, this is an issue for the here and now. I once said climate change was my generation’s nuclear free moment. That was a reference to how the generation before me had fought for and won nuclear free status for New Zealand, a position that we also fought for in the Pacific, especially supporting Pacific nations in their opposition to French nuclear testing here. So what is climate change to you? What injustices that you see now will motivate you to act and achieve more than what is currently being achieved. And most importantly what can you do to help bring the Pacific together as we address these challenges. It is fitting that I am here talking about the importance of regionalism and leadership at the University of the South Pacific (USP), a training ground for future leaders.  The USP is a wonderful example of regionalism in action. It is jointly owned by the governments of twelve Pacific countries and is so very important to the region, being the largest source of tertiary-educated graduates in the Pacific for over fifty years. Many Pacific leaders and politicians have studied at USP. But all of these organisations like USP and the PIF and other components of the regional architecture, these partnerships both young and old, they all distil down into a challenge and a solution. We are living in an increasingly borderless world. The desire of super-powers in the face of globalisation has been to exert their power and show signs of strength and influence. Our region is no longer a place of blue ocean, but strategically important. All of that adds up to a difficult position for small island nations – but not for ones that have the architecture we have as a region. That has a clear understanding of our joint challenges of what our shared values are and a willingness to work together because of it. In a tough world the Pacific way can be and is the answer. There is a well-known Māori proverb we often quote in New Zealand, for good reason: He aha te mea nui o tea ao? He tangata, he tangata, he tangata This means, what is the most important thing in the world? The people, the people, the people.We need to and will continue to focus on and invest in the people of our region, so our children and our grandchildren are able to continue to live fulfilling lives across this Blue Pacific continent of ours. Thank you all, for being here today, for caring about our region and its future. And I encourage you, the leaders of today and tomorrow, to continue to work collectively and think creatively about ways to address the challenges of our region.  It is only if we come together and work as a region that we will progress. Vinaka vakalevu. Thank you.  "

I especially wish to pay my respects to those who have died from the virus, those who are sick, and their families and loved ones.Ambassador Wu, New Zealand acknowledges the significant and sustained measures being taken by the Chinese Government to contain the virus. It is my sincere hope that the current precautionary restrictions we have in place can be lifted as soon as possible, and that when they do we work closely to normalise commerce and people to people links. I am confident that through cooperation we can both bounce back quickly. The virus has highlighted the breadth of connection between our countries. From Chinese students who study in New Zealand, to tourism, and commodity exports affected by the situation on the ground in China itself. The strength of the bilateral relationship means that while there has been much that has been affected in recent week, there is also a sound footing for us to restore, normalise and indeed advance our relationship once the current outbreak is over.  I also wish to comment on the concern and uncertainty that the virus has created. The Government has been at pains to ensure our decisions are based on the best public health advice available. We’ve also been at pains to give the community the reassurance it needs. Now, more than ever we must stand strong and support one another, call out any discrimination we see, and ensure we see only compassion and unity.We share your hopes for a quick resolution, for people’s health and wellbeing. I now invite you to stand for a moment of silence - as a show of respect to those who have lost their lives.I do now wish to turn to the reason for our gathering. The Lunar New Year is an opportunity to celebrate a new beginning.  The Year of the Rat is the first year in the twelve-year zodiac cycle and represents a new and prosperous era. People born in the Year of the Rat are said to be optimistic, imaginative, and clever. The Rat symbolises prosperity, strength, kindness, and innovation.These qualities are important for us all. I, for one, will continue to reflect these qualities in my work in building an equitable and inclusive Aotearoa New Zealand.  And, in doing so, I continue a long tradition.Aotearoa New Zealand’s Chinese communities are one of our oldest and largest community groups. The first Chinese migrants to New Zealand arrived over 170 years ago, and many others have followed since then.Today, Statistics New Zealand estimates the Chinese community to be over 260,000 people, about 5% of the population.  Within that figure lies a great deal of diversity – different countries of origin, different dialects, long-term residents, more recent arrivals, children, students, parents, and grand-parents. All add to the rich tapestry that is modern Aotearoa New Zealand.In 2004, the Government established the Chinese Poll Tax Heritage Trust, with the aim of strengthening the identity of Chinese New Zealanders and their communities in New Zealand.Over the past 15 years, the Trust has supported numerous projects including, exhibitions, research, and publications such as histories of New Zealand’s Chinese fruit shops, laundries, and churches.These projects paint a remarkable picture of Chinese migrants striving to integrate and contribute to Aotearoa New Zealand communities – often in challenging circumstances.Values of resilience, dedication, and generosity continue to define Aotearoa New Zealand’s Chinese communities today.To mark the history of the community, tonight, we are very privileged to showcase one of the initiatives supported by the Ethnic Communities Development Fund - a short film called Looking back, Moving on initiated by the Auckland Chinese Community Centre.To quote Neill Atkinson, Chief Historian at the Ministry of Culture and Heritage: This engaging short film brings to life some of the rich human stories of Aotearoa New Zealand’s history, revealing how a group of New Zealanders overcame discrimination and injustice to establish vibrant communities that have made an enduring contribution to our society. Understanding our history and learning from the past is as relevant and vital today as ever.Telling these stories is critical, now more than ever, and as I did last year I congratulate the Chinese Community Centre for the role you play in telling them.

Nau mai haere mai ki te Whare Pāremata. E ngā mana whenua ki tēnei rohe Taranaki Whānui, Te Upoko o Te Ika, Ngāti Toa Rangatira, Ngāti Raukawa – kei te mihi, kei te mihi, kei te mihi.E ngā mana, e ngā reo, e ngā rangatira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa.Greetings, everybody. It's my absolute pleasure to be back with you today. First, can I acknowledge IPANZ and the terrific work you do in promoting the importance of good public administration and of a strong public service ethos. It is vitally important to me that we uphold those values, that we keep talking about the role of public services in our society and we continually improve them. I do want to start, just before I get into a few of the things we have done, are doing and plan to do in the broader public services space, to once again put on record my appreciation on behalf of the Government for the incredible job that our public service and our broader state sector does to support the Government of the day. I spoke last year in February and the 15th of March had not happened by that point. I want to say that while the 15th of March was the very darkest of days for New Zealand and the very worst of times, the response by the New Zealand public service was of the highest quality. As New Zealanders we can be immensely proud of the response of everybody, ranging from our emergency services, our first responders all the way through to the officials who set up in tents in Hagley Park to provide immigration, social development services, the Office of Ethnic Communities who were on the ground right away, in there with the families of those who had been killed and injured. It was an Herculean effort. That is the public service ethos and I am so proud to have seen it in action in and around the 15th of March - it was a sight to behold. You can be all very proud of the people who were involved there in Christchurch. And very sadly for New Zealand, we had to repeat that with Whakāri White Island in December last year.  Once again, the broader public service, the state sector stepped up be it the Defence Force, the incredible efforts of our health professionals. I think it's a cliché, but I think it’s a cliché because it is true - the ability of New Zealanders to quickly turn their hand to whatever happens.  In Whakatane, the staff of that hospital, a small hospital, did the most remarkable things on that day. Just before that happened they had just done a mass casualty exercise which involved a crash at Whakatane Airport. They thought that they would have to intubate maybe two people at the crash site, on that day they intubated about 20 people.  They took on roles that most of us would never want to do. The person who does the maintenance at the hospital was doing the triaging of people coming off the helicopters. So not only in those situations of crisis and emergency do we see the public service work at its best, but we see it every day. We see it in the people who are in this room and in the quality of advice that you give to ministers and to support that you do give to implement the programs that are agreed by Government and I want you to know it's appreciated.I do want to say one caveat right at the beginning and that is that I understand that when you hear some of the lofty rhetoric that you hear from me when I'm talking about what I want to see change in the public sector.You might say, ‘well, I'm not seeing all of that in the day to day work that we are doing’ and I do want to acknowledge that up front, because this is a long process. We're talking about changing the whole way that we've gone about delivering public services pretty much for the last 30 years. It's about keeping the good bits and it's about moving forward in a more joined up way, in a way that takes longer term perspective and thinks about our success in different waysThat's not going to happen all at once and I want to acknowledge that ministers have quite a critical role in making sure that that does happen. So we haven’t built Rome in a day or in two years but I think we are making good progress, and I hope that you will feel that in some areas too.A big part of what we want to do is make sure that we deliver the Wellbeing Budget successfully and I believe that we did. The budget document genuinely for me represents a break from the past in the way that we put budgets together. Its physical appearance is actually I think a good metaphor for what we were trying to do. We were trying to tell the story of what the Government was about and what the budget was a contributor to, not to try to see it as some kind of endpoint that we could wrap up, put on the shelf and say we did that, but rather a narrative about where we are as a country, how the interventions that we are proposing work and where we want to go with the future.What more did we learn as we went through? Well, we had goals like breaking down the silos of Government – of which we had some success. So if you look through this budget document, you'll see examples like Hāpaitia te Oranga Tangata - the programme that brings together Corrections, Police, Social Development and Whānau Ora, to start talking about how we do make sure we lower our prison rate, we reduce offending, we reduce recidivism, integrated projects between those agencies. This is terrific stuff. The joint venture on the elimination of domestic and sexual violence, an incredible project in many ways, and it's just worth repeating, from a ministerial point of view, the ministers involved: Jan Logie, Justice Undersecretary, Andrew Little as Justice Minister, Carmel Sepuloni as Social Development, Tracy Martin as Children’s Minister, Nanaia Mahuta from Māori Development, Chris Hipkins from Education, Stuart Nash from Police, Kelvin Davis from Corrections, Iain Lees-Galloway with ACC and Jenny Salesa with associate Education. All of those ministers and their agencies together working on one set of outcomes, one set of accountabilities with a parallel body in the NGO sector working alongside us. Anyone who’s been involved with it knows it hasn’t been plain sailing. It's being incredibly challenging to bring all of those things together but it’s a different way of working and it’s what the Wellbeing Approach is about. Breaking the silos down. The people who interact with sexual violence services don't want to know which government agency it is, they just want the help and assistance. We have to take that approach and we are very proud of the Joint Venture as a part of that.One you might not have heard much about – Healthy Active Learning. This is that the distant daughter of a programme called Healthy Eating Health Action which was run by the former Labour Government. This brings together the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Sport New Zealand to deliver programmes in schools that integrate together nutrition, physical activity and understanding the importance of those to you. It's an amazing programme and we’re about to roll out the first aspects of it in a month or so. One of the most interesting things about it is that at no point in the history of Sport New Zealand or its predecessor the Hillary Commission were they ever invited in by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education to a budget process. We did that this year. It is important to me that we’ve started to show that you can break those silos down even between the different parts of our broader public and state sector, not just within core government agencies and departments but out into the crown entities. Why not take that further why not start thinking about that with those that aren’t even part of the Government – NGOs, the possibilities are endless if you are prepared to break down those silos. So we feel like we have made a good start and good progress. But it didn't happen everywhere. We still had bids that were coming in that clearly hadn’t been talked about between ministers. We tried to run a process to support that by involving cabinet committees in the creation of budget packages. I have to say that didn't quite work either, it was at the wrong point in the process. The cabinet committee process is quite formal, it meant that ministers tended to position themselves rather than think about the broader goal that we were trying to achieve. As most of you know, we set the budget priorities and we asked for ministers to contribute to those priorities. The five priorities didn't line up with our cabinet committees exactly so we had competing conversations taking place. So one of the lessons we learned and one of the changes we made for this year was we took it out of the cabinet committee process and we simply created ministerial groups built around the five priorities.I’m right at the point of having to mesh them all together and I have to say that the ministers and their secretariats of officials who supported them did a great job. We've done much better at getting single packages from multiple ministers under those priority headings. We by and large kept the same priorities. We had to do that as the kinds of issues that we're looking at for the Wellbeing Approach are not going to be solved in one budget. So again, we’ve renamed them a bit so they're a bit clearer. We’ve stuck to a just transition to a low carbon economy, how do we engage and involve people in the future of work, lifting Māori and Pasifika opportunities, child wellbeing and the health priority being our physical and mental health. They are by and large the same and we need the consistency of that so that we can sustain our investment in those critical areas.In setting those priorities, in Budget 2019, we engaged the Government's network of science advisers in making sure that we got the right priorities. We are taking it another stage forward now in Budget 2020. We actually went out and got the whole network of science advisers to assess those priorities. That's how we decided to tweak some of them. We took it another step forward - we went out to a group of sector stakeholders - Council of Trade Unions, Business New Zealand, Maori Women’s Welfare League and others, and said do you think these priorities in your areas represent what we should be doing? And we tweaked them on the basis of that. We continue to use the Treasury's living standards framework as the core of looking for the evidence of what our priorities should be. So you are not going to see a lot of shift in the big indicators there but we did again tweak again on the basis of that.So we're improving this as we go. We are making this, to my mind, a different way of doing budgets and I want to keep building on it. But we have made those changes in the budget 2020, and we are getting somewhere with it.When you see the budget that comes out this year, hopefully once again, you'll see that wellbeing lens throughout it. We continue to analyse each budget bid on the basis of a wellbeing approach. I know people are getting used to writing wellbeing budget bids and they’re not just putting the word wellbeing into it and going ‘yes we’ve done it’ - people are actually now starting to really drive into what they're doing with it.The other really important aspect of that is taking a different approach to baseline reviews. Rather than seeing it as an ad hoc approach, we've gone for a much more systematic approach to going deep dive into the baselines starting with big-spending areas. So we started with the baseline review of the Ministry of Social Development. That was a very interesting exercise, and it deeply influenced what we needed in the budget. We are now on a pathway for understanding of the cost drivers. It's one of the things that led us to put a huge investment into more case managers at MSD because we realised that because of how the work programme at MSD had evolved, that core role of supporting people into work was actually being diminished by the tasks at hand.So that's what the baseline review can do. It's given us a pathway. We now have just completed the Defence one and that's too thrown up some really interesting issues for us, areas where things have not gone to plan, and we've had to ask ourselves why that is and start to correct the course.We’re now going to up the ante on that, we’re going to run more than one at a time. So the next couple we are looking at will be MBIE and the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice has come forward to us and said if that's what they want. That's how I think this should work. A baseline review shouldn't be seen as a razor gang, it should be seen as a partnership between the Treasury and the agencies involved. So baseline reviews now become important, because whatever we do in the Wellbeing Budget, unless we're applying the same wellbeing approach to baseline as we are to the new spending then we aren’t going to make the big differences that we want. That requires all of those involved in the preparation of budgets to be to be on top of it.In terms of where we want to take the public finance system from here. The Public Finance Act Wellbeing Amendment Bill this in the House at the moment. It is the piece of legislation that means that wellbeing must be reported on at budget time and it also obliges the Treasury to do a four yearly report on where the whole system is at on wellbeing.The next stage that we want to go through is how we take the best of the public finance regime that we've got, which does give us a great deal of transparency and is one of the things that contributes to New Zealand being well regarded in terms our public finance system, but then take it forward to address the weaknesses that we know exist.That includes many of the things that we’ve talked about - do we really have clear strategic intentions that are shared across the public service that they follow through on? How do we make sure we do get greater focus around baseline funding rather than just the new spending? How do we make sure that the annual cycle of budgeting and reporting and parliamentary scrutiny is actually useful to all of us? Are all of the reports we're writing about our spending actually helping add value to exercise? And how do we break down that fragmentation of funding both across and within portfolios to focus on delivering results? All of that work will be coming together over the coming months and I’m going to be releasing a discussion document shortly that will set out a series of proposals that go towards modernising our public finance system.It is going to include determining how the Government sets its priorities, piloting some fundamentally different approaches to planning and we’re already starting to do that at the moment. Also how we report with a number of agencies, how do we do that across agencies and shifting over time to multi-year budgeting. One of the things that I've been really excited about is the multi-year capital allowance, which was an enormous shift for us in terms of rather than doing annualised capital bids. So if we made a decision as we did in Budget 19 to buy the new P8 planes, I had to account for every dollar of those at once and it wiped out most of an annualised capital allowance, even though we actually weren’t spending the money until 2022/23. Giving ourselves a multi-year capital allowance has allowed us to plan out four years ahead - potentially that could go longer as well.  It meant that we could give four years of funding to education capital, it provided certainty for the building industry, schools to parents and a two year investment in health care. We now want to think about how that would work for multi-year budgeting generally across the operational side into departments. More information and real time information on outcomes based information and a greater focus on the effectiveness and efficiency of our spending – all of it too, not just the new stuff.I’ll just say a bit around the Public Service Bill because you know that's now been introduced. The critical element for us is establishing a piece of legislation that is actually called the Public Service Bill. Now no offence for those who were part of creating the state sector legislation, but even the loss of the name public service was something we struggled with and so we wanted to make sure we brought it back into the title. What the legislation does is establish the purpose, principles and values of an apolitical public service, as well as its role in government formation.For the first time, we're going to be clear about the Crown's role and relationship with Māori in law in terms of the public service. The act was silent on that until now and it's time to deal with it. We do want the public service to be able to move between agencies more easily, to be able to be part of those more flexible arrangements like joint ventures like inter-departmental executive boards. That requires us to have some more common conditions, the ability to move leave with you if you are going to move from one place to another, and we want to strengthen our leadership across the public service.I know there have been some criticisms of the legislation that it in some ways entrenches some of the things that people don't like about the State Sector Act. I think we actually are doing something quite different here that is about outcomes and about implementing the Wellbeing Approach. I think we've struck the balance between the organisational forms that we have now and the flexibility that I know that we all want to be able to deliver.We are, as I said, looking at some changes around strategic planning documents and we're working with a number of ministers and agencies at the moment to pilot different approaches in Justice, Social Development and Transport. They are piloting different ways of working, multi-year pathways, different approaches for focusing on issues and planning documents. So all of that amounts to a very big work programme in terms of where the public sector is at and I know that level of change can be somewhat frightening to people.  I also know that there will be a fairly understandable cynicism about whether or not this amounts to the kinds of changes we’re talking about. What I want to reassure you of is that we remain committed to a public service that upholds the best principles and ethics that you do every day, but also gives you the flexibility to be part of achieving those outcomes and goals.We think we’ve got the balance about right but we are always open to discussion on that. We keep driving that programme forward so that wellbeing is embedded, that our structure is supported and our public financing system supports that, and that ultimately you are supported to do your job on behalf of New Zealanders.Nō reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa.   "

It has been a long journey. The journey did not actually begin on 15 March 2019. It began on 30 June 1997.Almost 23 years ago, Justice Sir Thomas Thorp told us what was wrong with our firearms legislation.At that time, the Arms Act was already 14 years old. In 2020, the Arms Act 1983 is not only well out of date, but dangerously out of date.Successive governments failed to act on Thorp’s recommendations.What has been the cost of that failure?The National Party knows. The Act Party knows.They know, because the former MP for Epsom, the former National Police Minister, the former leader of the Act Party, the Honourable John Banks, has told them.He said, following the terror attack last year, that the greatest disappointment of his political life was his failure to act after the mass murder at Aramoana in 1990.Mr Speaker, I refuse to be the former Minister approached by victims’ families in 20 years and asked: why didn’t you change the law? Why didn’t you take the guns off the gangs and bring in tougher penalties for gun crime?These are questions that will haunt Simon Bridges and David Seymour instead.Owning a firearm is a privilege not a right.We need to do all we can to ensure only law-abiding citizens are able to obtain firearms licences and use firearms.Since March last year, Police have seized 2,138 illegal firearms from gangs and other offenders. It’s an average of 43 a week.There’s no point in members opposite wringing their hands over last week’s news from Tauranga, when a Police car was riddled with bullets from a high powered weapon.Mr Speaker, welcome to their world.Welcome to the everyday reality of Policing.I am on the side of the Police. I am working hard, alongside the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, and others in government, to give Police all the tools and resources they need to stay safe, as they work to keep our communities safe.That includes a trial of the Eagle helicopter in Christchurch just announced this week.It includes new body armour.It includes new Police on the street – soon to pass the milestone of 2,000 new Police since the Coalition Government took office.And it includes tougher penalties for gun crime.It includes new powers to stop a gang member ever getting a firearms licence – which they can do at the moment.This is a true government of law and order not a party of cheap rhetoric like the members opposite.They ran down Police numbers and ignored the Australian gangs who started arriving in 2008.Mr Speaker, I want to address some of the changes made at Select Committee.Detail of select committee processI want to thank the Finance and Expenditure Committee for their time and their careful deliberation, especially those who actually turned up to meetings.Since it was introduced more than five months ago, the legislation has been improved by the public process.The Committee heard from every single submitter who asked to be heard. And their voices have made a difference.I have also worked closely and collaboratively with Hon Ron Mark and New Zealand First to ensure we get the best law possible and I thank them for their constructive dialogue.The improvements deliver on the bill’s objectives and enhance the workability for both firearms licence holders and the Police.  This legislation will place greater controls over high risk firearms and the safe use of all firearms.  ChangesLicence durationWe proposed firearms licences of five years duration instead of the current 10 years.Many submitters commented that was too short.The committee found most firearms licence holders who receive a conviction do so within the first five years. So it recommended five year licences for first time licence holders only. Then for successful re-licensing it would be a 10 year licence. However, if an applicant had their previous licence revoked, or let it expire, their new licence will be for five years once more.This introduction of an interim step adds more security, and then gives trust – by allowing a longer licence period – after someone has demonstrated they are deserving of the privilege of holding a firearms licence. Technical changesThe Committee also reviewed the notice requirement for when Police wish to inspect a firearms licence holder’s storage, or a shooting club’s firearms storage. It has recommended that this should be at least seven days.The Committee also clarified that temporary transfers of firearms for less than 30 days would not require an update to the registry unless they are pistols, restricted weapons, prohibited firearms or prohibited magazines. This ensures that when firearm licence holders lend another licence holder their firearm, or leave their firearms temporarily in the care of another licence holder while travelling, we are not creating an overly burdensome compliance system.There are other technical changes.This includes a recommendation from the Privacy Commissioner that access to the firearms registry be clarified so the only reason for access is to assist agencies in their functions relating to arms. For example Customs’ access and use would be around managing the import of firearms into New Zealand. Health provisionsThere were also changes recommended to the provisions relating to health practitioners. These provisions are about keeping people safe during times of vulnerability. The Committee has clarified the definition of health practitioner to ensure only appropriate health professionals have to consider informing Police of a concern with a patient. Fit and proper person testMr Speaker, for the first time, the fit and proper person test for a firearms licence explicitly excludes gang members, associates, or members of an organised criminal group.Why is the Opposition trying to block this?They like to shoot off their mouth but do nothing about the actual criminal shooters.Changes made by the Committee also give Police the power to consider whether someone applying for a licence has had restraining orders made against them.The use of firearms in family harm is an indictment on our society.DealersThe Committee clarified the activities that would now require a dealer’s licence. It is recommended that the Bill state a dealer’s licence is required for people engaged in lending, hiring, selling, or supplying firearms as a commercial activity central to their business. The Committee also recommended that members of shooting clubs selling firearms for the benefit of the club, and hunting guides operating on a small scale, be exempt from the dealer regime. ConclusionThe changes we are looking to implement in this legislation have been worked on assiduously over the past few months.But in reality there is at least 23 years of knowledge and analysis behind them. We have taken the time to do a sense check on this bill.I am pleased with the work that officials, MPs, and communities have put into the creation of a better firearms system.A UMR poll in September found 70 per cent of people support strengthening our firearms laws. Sixteen per cent were opposed.In Canterbury, a staggering 81 per cent of people are calling for tougher gun laws.It is up to us as Government to listen to the voices of our communities, and to balance the lawful use of firearms against the harm they do in the wrong hands.I commend this bill to the House."

In his valedictory speech, Mike Moore said: ""It's nice to see so many people here at my farewell and funeral; if only people had said such supportive things when I was alive."" I'm sorry, Mike—you're going to have watch this Chamber once again set aside time to commend your many achievements.I've read the commentary about Mike since he passed. The word ""battler"" is often used. Mike fought for people. He fought for what he believed in. He fought for New Zealand's interests around the world, and, as any politician does, he had his share of battles here in Parliament. Despite those battles, Mike loved Parliament and politics—the debate, the policy, the theatre—but, ultimately, he loved all of these things because he loved those he was here to serve. Mike was undeniably a unique man and a unique politician, or, as Sir Geoffrey Palmer put it, a force of nature. He was a kind, caring, and humble man. Where he saw wrong, he tried to right it. He deeply believed politics was ultimately about improving people's lives.A true working-class Prime Minister, Mike Moore showed all New Zealanders that hard work, initiative, guts, and determination can lead to very big things. He taught everyone to aim for the stars, because that's what he did, via books. Mike left school at the age of 15 for a job in the freezing works, but he was an avid reader. That he made his way to Parliament just eight years later is a testament to his work ethic, his dedication, and his intellect. Through his love of learning and reading, he educated himself, and he was eventually awarded honorary doctorates from Lincoln University, the Auckland University of Technology, and the University of Canterbury, as well as an honorary doctorate from the People's University of China and an honorary doctorate from La Trobe University in Australia.Mike didn't stop at reading, though. Throughout his life, he was a prolific author and wrote books on economics, New Zealand history, politics, and much, much more. But in all of that, this place remained central to him. He once said, ""The Labour Party has been my training college, Parliament my university"". He loved the Parliamentary Library, and I'm told, credibly, that he would encourage others to use the library in the way that he did. This place mattered to Mike because of the power and potential that exists here, in the same way that he saw the power and potential of the people that he served in all walks of life.In the Hansard and his many interviews, we will always be able to remember Mike and hear his totally unique voice, and it's a voice that was consistent. Mike's affinity for the Labour Party developed at a young age. He joined Labour when he was 15 years old and was the first youth representative on the Labour Party executive. He was the vice-president of the International Union of Socialist Youth for two consecutive terms. This dedication to the Labour Party and its cause never diminished, over many decades. As a member of Parliament and as Prime Minister, Mike was passionate about many things, including constitutional change and creating a united New Zealand.I've spoken to some of his former colleagues, who noted how emotive Mike could be when discussing the history of our nation and his vision for the future of Aotearoa, a New Zealand, in his words ""more at peace with itself."" It was only fitting when Mike tried to, of course, in his final speech in this place, cheekily table a bill to this House on constitutional change. At the time, Mike said, ""A nation is the sum total of its history, its memories, and … experiences. A nation without history is like a man without a memory. It is good that we are confronting our historic ghosts and demons at last.""Mike would've been proud to see the debate and the discussion last week at Waitangi, where we came together to reflect on the past, to challenge our present, and to be hopeful about our future. We must continue to work together to create a nation we can continue to be proud of, building on the call that Mike left to all of us. On the paepae at Waitangi, many people spoke of Mike's passion for New Zealand and the work that he did to bring Kiwis together and promote our country to the world. In fact, some commented that this is where we saw Mike's true potential.It was unsurprising that Mike took a global leadership role in trade after he left politics. As Minister of Overseas Trade and Marketing, he was involved with the GATT trade round negotiations in their trade missions to Australia, China, Japan, the Middle East, Latin America, and across Europe. There aren't many people who can say they led both New Zealand and the world, but Mike is one of them. When he left Parliament to become the Director-General of the World Trade Organization, Mike took the same mentality he had as a politician in New Zealand. He approached trade as a way to help those in need, except, this time, he broadened his constituency and had the aim of helping entire nations in need. He saw trade as an opportunity to lift people out of poverty and to help developing countries grow economically. It was a way to help the little guy. Always keeping New Zealand close to his heart, he also saw trade as an opportunity for us to grow international relations and build a stronger economic base. We owe much to his hard work and dedication.Mike was also a staunch union man. Much like politics, he joined the union movement at a young age and became a member of the Auckland Trades Council when he was 17. Mike always had time for workers because he was one himself. He once said it was rubbish that you do not make real friends in Parliament, before listing his real friends, that include the drivers, messengers, the library staff, the staff at Bellamy's, the security guards, and researchers. It shows us who Mike was. It didn't matter what your role was; Mike was always keen to talk, to listen. He was a man of the people.I was fortunate enough to see Mike a few days before he passed, and he encouraged me to keep thinking about the vision we hold for the future—not one for small talk. So, Mike, I want to say we will keep aiming high. You led by example and showed what hard work, passion, and care for others can achieve. I'd like to end with a mihi recently penned by a member in this House.Translated, the mihi reads: ""The totara of the political world has fallen. Sir, you travelled the distance, scaled the heights, traversed the seas, now your time is over and you must return. Your Waka awaits [you] on the tides of Matauri, the prow faces the current of farewell, go those who preceded you in the great beyond, sleep in peace chief of deed, of word, of people.""Moe mai rā, Mike, moe mai rā."

Second, special guest Robert “Bom” Gillies - one of the two surviving members of the 28 Maori Battalion.“Bom” enlisted in Rotorua when he was 17 years old and his service took him to Africa, Italy, and the Middle East.  Thank you for attending. It is an honour to have you here.The other surviving member of the battalion, Epineha “Pine’ Ratapu, was unable to attend but it was good to hear he recently celebrated his 98th birthday at his home in Masterton.Let us acknowledge the nine women attending who are widows of men who served in the battalion. And let us acknowledge the representatives of eight of the ten commanding officers of the Battalion.All of you are the collective whanau and it is seriously humbling that you are all present on this auspicious day.Two days ago we unveiled a statue for Dame Whina Cooper at Panguru. In 1981 Whina went to a house by the rail way line it Otirira that was owned by Motatau Shortland. As an aside the Otirira railway line is going to be reopened soon. But on that day in 1981, as soon as Motatau invited Whina in to his house, she said “I have been here before. This is the home where we all gathered in World War Two, to pack parcels for the Maori Battalion”. She began to discuss the rooms and the storage purposes allocated. Her memory was very clear. So moving on, today is the outcome of our remembering the past. And a term of coalition government negotiations in October 2017.New Zealand First entered the negotiation with a range of proposals to advance the interests of this country.This is one of them.It is why we are here today.The 28th Maori Battalion is a unique feature of our history.  The circumstances which lead to the battalion’s existence, and to the contribution it made, are unlikely to ever exist again.That is why we must record, preserve, and honour its contribution.It is fitting the museum is placed here on the Waitangi treaty grounds - and the centrepiece of our annual Treaty commemoration.However, it must be remembered the spirit of the Maori Battalion is shared by many other marae around the country – to borrow an old saying “courage has many resting places.”As we all know, the battalion is associated with Sir Apirana Ngata and his aspirations for Maori.  He saw a Maori-only battalion as a pathway to respect and equality.He viewed sacrifice in war as “the price of citizenship” and a pathway for Maori determinism.The relationship between Maori and the Crown never stops evolving. It is shaped by emerging perception and interpretation.This relationship is moulded by the status of various treaty settlements, emerging tribunal claims, and the resolution of historical grievance.Today our purpose is to recognise the role of the 28th Maori Battalion, and its unique legacy in our history.It is said that these men were united by shared values and similarity of character.Everyone volunteered. Volunteered at a greater rate than compulsory conscription. They were united in wanting to fight for this country.They accepted that there was an international threat to this part of the world and to our nation.They were united by pride, loyalty, determination, and a willingness to fight.For some they couldn’t wait to get out of the bush and see the world. And they readily accepted they might lose their lives fighting for this country and what it stood for. The number of stories of young Maori lying about their age, or in one case, switching his hand to deceptively pass an eye test to hide the absence of sight in one eye, are legend. Mat Te Hau only had one seeing eye. Without hesitation everybody recognised the military prowess of the Maori battalion.So the Maori battalion was formed by self-belief and shaped by a value of unquestionably serving New Zealand.There are names etched in history which will never be forgotten – Ngarimu, Awatere, Henare, Manahi to name just a few of the many brave.The courage was outstanding. The sacrifice was heavy.We hope that we will never see again the circumstances which gave rise to the Maori Battalion, nor see the scale of contribution by such a group of men and their families. It is why we must never forget.ENDS "

And to you who succeed, and are here today at Waitangi.Last year, as I stood before you we mourned two tall trees in the forest of Tane, Kingi and Koro. We have experienced great loss again.Last year as we sat on the marae we acknowledged Sir Hek Busby. I felt very privileged to sit alongside him as he was finally acknowledged for the generations that he has inspired, for the passing down of knowledge of waka hourua. As we sat next to each other, he remarked on how proud he was of the haka that was performed that day, and I know he would have felt the same today.This is our first Waitangi without Pita Paraone. He was a Board member. He was a Member of Parliament. He was a member of whanau. He will always be present.For the Labour whanau, and for Aotearoa, we also mourn the loss of Mike Moore. He was a man who gave his life to the service of Aotearoa New Zealand. And we mourn him.Finally, I want to acknowledge the loss of Piri Sciascia. Today I began with a modified mihi that was written by Piri for me last year. That was one small way that I could acknowledge the role he played for me as a kaumatua, an adviser and as a friend.I will miss his korero. Haere, Haere, Haere atu raTo all of those who have spoken today, particularly Anaru Iti, I will take my lessons in te reo Maori from now on from you Anaru. From all of the speakers today, for many of you there is much with which we agree: everybody hates GST. Except for Grant Robertson.And the reason that there is much on which we agree is because so many who sit on this side of the marae [indicates one side] have sat on this side [indicates the other side].I was reminded yesterday as we spoke of the land march of 1975, our Speaker Trevor Mallard, he marched. Shane Jones has spoken of being here in protest – up a tree.We know there have been many on this side of the marae [indicates] who spoke in challenge of what was happening at that time in our history. Willie Jackson has always been a voice of challenge. And on this side, we have Kelvin Davis, Willow-Jean Prime, Marama, all sons and daughters off the North.And on this side [indicates] we have Rino Tirikatene working with the Waitangi Trust Board.What I want to acknowledge is that we have a challenge on this side and we have a challenge from within. And that is what should happen here on this day. We should be here to challenge.When I first came here, I said hold me to account and I will keep coming back here so you can do just that. Not because we lack scrutiny, there is plenty of that, but because we should never be afraid of it.Waitangi is the place where we acknowledge our past. But it must also be the place where we challenge our present, but where we be collectively hopeful about our future.When we talk about our present there are challenges. But there are also signs of change. Signs of change, manifestations of Oritetanga, manifestations of us fulfilling our obligations to Te Tirti, which we must continually, not just the principles but the articles.What are those signs? They are signs that there is change but also that there is more work.Yes, Maori unemployment is in some of its lowest levels in 10 years. But there is more mahi to do.We have 8000 Maori, particularly rangatahi, who are in apprenticeships now. But there is more mahi to do.We've just graduated 500 teachers and support workers who are out in our schools and our education system teaching Te Reo Maori, integrating it into everything they do. But there is more mahi to do.We've helped more than 2000 more Maori families into public housing. But there is more mahi to do.We've increased funding to Whanau ora. But there is more mahi to do.The Provincial Growth Fund - I don’t need to tell you what’s happened in the North, you’ve seen it for yourself. More than $1.4 billion going into communities that will benefit Maori. But there is more mahi to do.We've increased the minimum wage. We've put food in schools. We’ve increased paid parental leave. We've created increases in support for whanau.But it is more mahi to doBut by our deeds you will know us.While all of that may change lives, it doesn’t fundamentally change who we are as Aotearoa New Zealand. So when I said hold us to account, I didn't just mean what we do. I also meant how we do it.It was when I first became Prime Minister that I was welcomed onto a marae in Rotorua and I first heard the discussion around the two worlds in which we exist, the Maori world and the Pakeha world. And we often talk about the representation of those two worlds by the two houses that sit here at Waitangi.And we talk about the connection between the two by Te Tiriti and acknowledge Whakaputanga.But every time we learn from one another, every time we have an exchange of culture, a shared understanding of history, then we see the crossover, the crossover on the bridge between the two worlds. But as was said at that marae that day in Rotorua, and as I’ve heard Reverend Charlie Shortland ask, who has crossed the bridge more?The way we do things matters.Our Maori MPs, our Maori Ministers, they cross that bridge every day. But so must all of us. That is why you heard Andrew Little today whaikorero as an example of the effort that we wish to keep making to cross over into the Maori world as so often we have asked you to cross into the Pakeha world.It is an example of how we wish to bring our worlds closer together, to build knowledge, understanding, to strengthen the relationship. And there are many ways we can do that. The last two years, we've worked hard to lift the representation as it should be of Maori at the seats where decisions are made.For the first time, a small example, our district health boards fully represent the Maori population. For the first time. Twenty per cent of the appointments we have made have been Maori.We’ve worked to integrate te reo Maori into our schools.We partnered on difficult issues like data sovereignty, housing, corrections, and we must continue the dialogue on the issues that are hardest.And I list in that Oranga Tamariki. We must continue to work together.But doing things differently includes how we acknowledge our history. Yesterday was one example of that. Finally, to see an acknowledgement in the form of a statue of Dame Whina Cooper at Panguru. Not before time. To see a commitment that we will finally have the teaching of New Zealand histories in schools. And I hope you saw from the way that we wished to work with Tuia 250 that we want to honour and grow the sharing of knowledge around the navigational history of Maori and Pasifika.That is work we must keep doing. There is only a legacy to be shed from that period in our history. To honour Sir Hek and the incredible knowledge which he worked so hard to share with the next generation. And today, Sir Hek, we honour you.Today marks the beginning of the formation of a national body for waka hourua that we are committed to establishing. A national body that will work together to form a strategy around the teaching of waka hourua MataurangaThat will include the Government supporting employees around the country so the next generation can learn the important knowledge of the navigational history that Sir Hek dedicated his life to teaching.It is not just what we do, it is how we do it.It is the foundations that we lay. It is a right, not a privilege, that every child knows their history and their whakapapa.And it is an obligation and responsibility for every generation in a position of power to work to bring our houses together. Not just in programmes, not just in policies, but in relationships. To cross Te Arawhiti. And to cross Te Arawhiti no matter how many times we may stumble.No Reira, tena koutou, tena koutou, tena tatou katoa. "

It is good to see so many nations represented here to share in this 180th commemoration of the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi. Welcome, especially to those for whom this is your first visit to Waitangi, the historic birthplace of modern New Zealand. The land on which we stand lies in the tribal area of Ngā Puhi. We would like to offer our thanks to Ngā Puhi for hosting us here in Northland.Northland, the “birthplace” of New Zealand’s foreign relationsNorthland has a long history of engagement with travellers from afar. Local legend tells the story of Kupe, the first Polynesian settler to reach New Zealand one thousand years ago.In the early nineteenth century, the Bay of Islands became the major whaling port of the Pacific. Missionaries settled in Northland from 1814, followed soon after by European tradesmen, merchants and land speculators, and then the first British Resident in 1833.This was a time of opportunity, for Māori and for Europeans. But it was not without discord, and often times conflict. The significance of Waitangi 180 years ago, just two kilometres up the road from where we are now, representatives of the British Crown and the rangatira or Chief of Northland signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This was the start of a project – about how we work together, respecting difference and seeking to create a fair and just society.Waitangi therefore holds great significance for New Zealanders. At Waitangi you will find our foundations as a nation and as a society.Celebrations on Waitangi Day highlight the special status of Māori as tangata whenua or people and the land.The legacy of the TreatyWaitangi Day is also an important day for dialogue and debate as a nation. It was not uncommon in past times to see the celebrations contrasted with protest. This legacy of Waitangi is lived in this country every day. As New Zealanders, we pride ourselves on making our voices heard and addressing our differences freely and openly.We do our best to do the right thing. Where things aren’t right, we endeavour to put them right.The Treaty in New Zealand foreign policyThe principles that guide New Zealand’s foreign policy also have their roots in this domestic history. We uphold democracy – one person, one vote, since 1893. We value freedom, from fear, from want. We defend human rights, as set out in the 1940 Universal Declaration, and we promote stewardship for our environment.The experience of Waitangi also drives us to empower diverse voices in our region. Under the Pacific Reset, we are committed to a safer and more prosperous Pacific. The disproportionate impact of climate change on our Pacific Island neighbours, in particular, stresses the need for an empowered Pacific, able to share its unique voice on the world stage. A principled approach to global challengesWith our own voice, too, we continue to speak up in defence of international rules and institutions in this time of growing turbulence. The challenges facing the international rules-based system are increasingly grave, and it is the responsibility of us all in this room to be advocates for peace and cooperation.Thank you all for supporting New Zealand’s global connections. In this complex environment, your role as diplomats, as relationship-builders, as solution-finders is vital. Your work in New Zealand helps build trust and understanding, and helps identify common ground. During your time here please take the opportunity to reflect on the significance of Waitangi and its legacy. For those of you returning offshore, please take with you strengthened bonds of friendship."

The citizenship promised by the Te Tiriti.We restore tino rangatiratanga. We uphold the spirit of Te Tiriti. This is to start to truly honour Te Tiriti.But there is another agreement we cannot ignore. It is very important to Māori of the north.It is He Whakaputanga. Neither He Whakaputanga nor Te Tiriti stand on their own.We have talked much about Te Tiriti. We must talk about He Whakaputanga. There are many thoughts about it. But we must talk about it. We must understand. What does it mean in the 21st century, 185 years on. It is a tremendous responsibility to serve as Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister. My discussions with Ngāpuhi have been some of the most challenging, rewarding and important of my life.I’ve been asked to listen.I’ve been asked to talk.I’ve been told to stay away.I’ve been told come and live here.And I remain committed to forging a waka hourua between Ngāpuhi and the Crown.We are now 20 years away from the 200th anniversary of the signing of Te Tiriti o Waitangi.It is my hope that by then the promise of Te Tiriti is upheld.The challenge of the next steps should never deter us from moving forward in the journey.The roots have been restored, the trunk of the tree has firmed, and the first shoots of new terrain are blossoming, like the great kowhai of kowhaitangi. Kei tēnei papa whenua i te Pepuere o te tau Kotahi mano e iwa rau whā tekau, kotahi rau tau i muri iho i te hainatanga o Te Tiriti, i karangatia e Tā Āpirana Ngata kia whai wāhi te iwi Māori.I kōrerotia e ia te ""utu o te kirirarau"" mō te iwi Māori i te wā e whakarite ana te Ope Taua 28 (Māori) ki te haere ki te pakanga e toru marama i muri iho.Kua utua kētia e te iwi Māori te utu o te kirirarau.Ko ngā tāpaetanga me ngā whakahere a te iwi Māori he mea whatu ki tō tātou hītori.Nō waenganui o ngā tekau tau tahi mano e iwa rau iwa tekau, kua puta mai te rangahau hou e whaimōhio ana ki te Mātauranga Māori.

2020-01-29T21:35:32Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Winston Peters                    ,  North Auckland Line Announcement,"[Check against delivery]Good morning.We promised we would bring back rail, and that’s what we’re doing. In a little over two years we have allocated more than $3 billion to restore a reliable, resilient and safe freight and tourism network. That includes $1.226 billion from the Budget, hundreds of millions from the Provincial Growth Fund, and $815 million from the National Land Transport Fund. And yesterday we announced a further $1.14 billion for four much-needed rail projects as part of a broader $12 billion package.Today, we have the pleasure of announcing $109.7 million to enable Northland’s producers to send freight around the country by rail. The last three decades have seen appalling neglect of our rail system and the Northland Line hasn’t seen serious investment in over 50 years.The previous Government had a malignant, derelict, brainless policy of deliberately running railways down.But this Government knows that rail is a critical part of an integrated transport network.Rail is a cost-effective choice for sending products long distance, to reduce congestion and wear and tear on major roads, and to lower carbon emissions from freight. We are making sure that rail’s place in our transport system is fully recognised and that it is funded sustainably in the years and decades ahead. You are all aware how important we believe rail is for the future of Northland. KiwiRail currently moves about 116,000 tonnes of freight a year on this rail line – that’s barely 5 per cent of the freight volumes leaving this region. It’s a far cry from the near million tonnes moved by rail in Northland before the port moved to Marsden Point (in 2007). We need less congestion on the region’s roads and more freight on our trains. There are 30,000 containers leaving Northland on the back of trucks each year. And some of those exports are being trucked from Whangarei to South Auckland to go on trains to Tauranga Port. That is nonsense. It’s absurd. It’s inefficient and, quite frankly, it’s unfair to the people of Northland. Trucks are clogging Northland’s roads and highways because for decades the investment in rail hasn’t come close to what it should have been. Our Government is committed to rebuilding Northland’s rail network, making trains reliable and a real option for Northland businesses to get their goods to port and to market. We are giving the people of Northland the railway they deserve; giving them the same rail access and opportunities that other regions have. We are doing what should have been done a long time ago. Last year we announced almost $95 million through the PGF to save the line between Auckland and Whangarei. Without our investment this line would have continued to decline and would have closed within a few years. We were not going to let that happen. With today’s announcement we are setting the right conditions to really bring rail back to this region. Being able to fit standard shipping containers through the tunnels on this line will mean KiwiRail will be able to compete directly with road freight. We’re also backing rail to expand further into Northland by reopening the line to Otiria. As agriculture and horticulture in the far north grows, rail will be there to support that growth. It’s about getting ahead of the curve. And we’re enabling KiwiRail to buy the land they need to build a spur line to Northport and Marsden Point. You all know our feelings about the future of Auckland’s Port. It has to come north so this region can see the jobs and business growth it will bring. Cabinet will be making a decision on that in due course but we need to be ready. It is going to be a long road back for rail Northland, but we have made a major step on that journey today. My colleague Shane Jones, a true son of Northland, will now fill you in on the details around today’s announcement.Thank you.ENDS"

In particular, thank you to Justin and Villa Maria for hosting us this morning and your outline of some of Villa Maria’s sustainability initiatives. Can I also acknowledge WasteMINZ’s CEO Janine Brinsdon, chair of the Territorial Authorities Forum Parul Sood, Project Manager Jenny Marshall and officials from the Ministry for the Environment.I want to thank WasteMINZ and the Territorial Authorities’ Officers Forum for leading this critical piece of research on plastic waste and recycling, which I am pleased to say has been supported with substantial funding from the Ministry for the Environment’s Waste Minimisation Fund.Can I also acknowledge Dr Rachel Chiaroni-Clark from the office of the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor and chief author of the report ‘Rethinking Plastics in Aotearoa New Zealand’ released by the Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and I last December. This WasteMINZ report fills in some of the gaps in information about plastics identified in that report. And of course, Sunshine Yates Consulting, who conducted the nation-wide audit of household rubbish and recycling bins and bags and most of all can I acknowledge those hardy people who spent 25 days sorting through the household rubbish from 652 households and recycling bins from 708 households by hand from 25 local authorities at eight locations to provide us with the information on which the ‘Rethinking Rubbish and Recycling’ report is based.Given what ends up in rubbish bins and in recycling crates and bins thanks to a high proportion of “wish cycling,” that would have been a very unpleasant task - so please pass on my sincere thanks to each of them. I have only had time to dip into the report, and it is much-needed data on what is going into our recycling and rubbish, it has come at just the right time, and will help inform our efforts to address this problem. Statistics that jump out at me are that:Based on the households audited, New Zealanders use an estimated 1.76 billion plastic containers each year. That means the average New Zealand family uses an estimated 37 kilos of plastic containers each year. Some 39 per cent of their plastic bottles and containers are sent to landfill, despite being fully recyclable.The most common plastic item in NZ is the plastic drink bottle with an average household using an estimated 188 plastic drink bottles each year  The data collected indicates up to an estimated 97 million plastic drink bottles are headed to the tip annually – again, when there are recycling options.[1]While this does not tell a great story about our waste trajectory, having this up-to-date waste data, gathered in 2019, which tells us information that we have not had until now, is very helpful.Through this representative trawl of household rubbish and recycling bins in eight locations across New Zealand, we are able to get a true picture of the extent of the challenge we face – of rethinking plastics and product design, and of changing consumer behaviour to avoid problem plastics and avoid creating plastic waste, and make recycling instinctive and second nature to every single person in Aotearoa New Zealand.  Change is possible and is happening. Just as consumers and supermarkets led the way with phasing out single-use plastic shopping bags, leading companies are already making a difference. Flight Plastics Ltd have been producing high-quality recycled PET for years and PACT group are building a new plant to do the same in Auckland. Government, businesses, councils, community organisations and consumers working together can tackle New Zealand’s mounting waste problem.We are living in extremely dynamic times when it comes to plastic and resource recovery. We now have several countries, including China, banning the importation of plastic waste. Once upon a time it was out of sight, out of mind. But we can no longer wish away our waste.Recently China announced it is banning single-use plastics from 2025. Another development that demonstrates the world is changing and has woken up to the fact that we must seriously look at how we keep products and materials in circulation for longer, and how we incentivise systems for re-use rather than continue down a path of take, make and throw away. Managing plastic is a global issue which needs governments to set direction, provide leadership and put in place supporting regulations, incentives and investment. This Government is committed to taking a leadership role in addressing New Zealand’s mounting waste and plastic problem. In the last two years, we have banned single-use plastic shopping bags and microbeads, and we’ve set in train an ambitious work programme, aimed at speeding up the shift to a more efficient, jobs-rich circular economy. The programme includes: Designing a container return scheme which will increase the recovery of drink bottles and cans for beverages consumed both at and away from home, so that the materials they are made of, such as aluminium and plastic, can be recovered for recycling, thereby reducing litter and waste.It includes regulated product stewardship schemes for challenging products such as e-waste, tyres and batteries to design waste out of the system from the get-go and ensure these products are dealt with appropriately at the end of their life, and materials recovered and reprocessed rather than ending up in landfills.A major initiative is expanding and improving the landfill levy to help fund more recycling facilities right here at home in Aotearoa and more ways to recover, re-use and reprocess materials, including from construction and demolition sites, glass and cardboard and paper; while creating jobs in the process.  Submissions close on Monday.A National Resource Recovery work programme is underway to recharge recycling in New Zealand in response to China and other countries’ bans on importing waste and recyclables; make kerbside collection recycling and resource recovery schemes better and more consistent.  Consistency will enable nationwide education campaigns for the public.Using the revenue from the landfill levy through the Waste Minimisation Fund (WMF) to strategically invest in projects like this WasteMINZ audit and report, which improves waste data so we have a better picture of where waste is coming from and where it’s going. Sustainable Coastlines, also with substantial funding from the WMF has also been doing great citizen science work here, enabling those involved in beach clean-ups to contribute statistically robust information on beach litter pollution.And there is the $40 million Provincial Growth Fund investment to turn plastic waste and other materials into useful resources for businesses and consumers.And lastly, there is the pivotal report by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor Dr Juliet Gerrard – ‘Rethinking Plastics in Aotearoa New Zealand’ with its wide-ranging recommendations for dealing with plastic waste. The Government has welcomed this report and MFE is now developing a more substantive response to it about how best to galvanize this action. Government’s initial response to the ‘Rethinking Plastics’ report which the Prime Minister and I signalled last December was that the Government will work alongside industry and businesses and councils to set goals for shifting away from low-value and hard-to-recycle plastic. Our first target will be to move away from single-use food and beverage packaging made of hard-to-recycle PVC and expanded polystyrene food and beverage packaging. Because on the surface it looks very similar to PET, shifting away from PVC for items such as meat trays will help to reduce contamination in our recycling system and make it easier for recyclers like Flight Plastics to reprocess high-value materials like PET. It will also help to ensure that more of the materials that enter our kerbside systems – can in fact be recycled and have a market. The Government will also continue to work with industry and business and other stakeholders to develop a labelling scheme for packaging, including plastic packaging. This will help to make it easier for New Zealanders to identify what can and can’t be recycled and take some of the confusion out of recycling. And while we are doing this, businesses doesn’t have to wait. My message to the manufacturing leaders, retailers and marketing experts here today is that you can do several things immediately that will make a big difference to solving our plastic recycling challenge:If you don’t need to package a product that will be used in days or weeks with plastic materials that will last a century then don’t.  I am heartened that one of NZ’s largest coffee roasters and suppliers has recognised this contradiction and is actively thinking about how it wants to package its coffee to reduce or avoid plastic waste.  Wherever possible, for retail packaging choose PET (1), HDPE (2) and Polypropylene (5) over other types of plastic.  They can be easily recycled. As the report’s useful graphics highlight – there are limited markets and opportunities to reuse plastics 3, 4, 6 and 7. Avoid mixed materials. If you are using many different materials and components in your products like plastic sleeves, cardboard – can you change this? That is because the more material types that are included, the harder it is to recycle. Shrink-wrapped plastic sleeves make life difficult for optical sorters – they can’t distinguish the outer sleeve from the container itself, and unlike adhesive labels, the sleeves are hard to remove during the recycling process. This means that high-value number 1 or 2 plastic gets labelled as low value and included in bales of mixed plastic, and is not reprocessed here in New Zealand. Avoid coloured plastic for beverage containers and instead use clear (PET) or natural coloured (HDPE) plastics, which can be recycled at least seven or eight times for a higher value right here in New Zealand.  Engrave or print the plastic resin ID code (1-7) on your product packaging so that recyclers and the public can clearly identify what type of plastic it is (and whether this should be included in their kerbside bins).  And if you’re responsible for producing millions of milk bottles then it’s time to get on with helping build the plant to reprocess them here in New Zealand.  Plastic is fundamental to our everyday life, but is one of our generation’s greatest environmental challenges, especially when it ends up in the oceans and kills whales, turtles and seabirds such as the juvenile toroa/royal albatross found recently at Gisborne with a flattened plastic bottle in its stomach. But with this comes huge opportunities, especially for innovative business. One of the pleasures of my job is getting to visit creative businesses and community groups around the country who are already designing the solutions we need.  Flight Plastics in Lower Hutt has been making food packaging from recycled plastic PET bottles for a number of years, funded by the landfill levy via the Waste Minimisation Fund. You only have to read newspapers, social media or listen to talk-back to know the public is urging us on. Business and the community are telling us it is time for more decisive action.  Public polls show preferences for tougher measures on waste, particularly single-use plastic. And I regularly receive emails and letters – including from school-children – demanding the government do more. It is encouraging to know we have this support and to see the momentum this is creating.Tomorrow I’ll be launching a new campaign by MfE which encourages people in a fun way to take a simple action to reuse and reduce waste. We hope you’ll join in this campaign – and encourage your friends and whānau to do so too.We want to move plastic through a circular economy, drastically reducing plastic waste and pollution. As today’s Truth about Plastic Recycling report shows, there is much work ahead of us to achieve this goal. And I’m confident that together we can do this. Kia ora koutou katoa.

It is a pleasure to be here on opening day of the 2020 National Yearling Sales Series.Let us all acknowledge Sir Peter Vela and the Vela family for their outstanding contribution to the New Zealand racing industry, and continued support.And a warm welcome to the Sales Series. This includes a special welcome to those who are visiting or watching from overseas.This year is the 94th edition of the National Yearling sales. And 2020 has produced an impressive catalogue.  Yet again it enhances New Zealand’s reputation for high quality racing bloodstock.Horses sold here at Karaka go on to have outstanding success both at home and abroad. Over 80 per cent of Group One winners in New Zealand last season were sourced at New Zealand Bloodstock. More than half of all Group One winners in Hong Kong last season were Karaka graduates. And New Zealand-bred horses have had similar success in Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Macau. So over the next few days there are many reasons to bid high and buy well !The government has a clear vision for this industry and the need to protect and promote this great sport.The new Racing Industry Bill was introduced to Parliament just prior to Christmas and is presently before a select committee.This once great industry is at the crossroads. It is time for the industry to work together and use the opportunity before it.And yet there are some willingly spreading falsehoods and misinformation.Ignorance will suffocate this industry, not save or grow the industry.One trade publication has made a series of claims which must be rebutted.RevenueIt has been claimed “racing is in the worse state it has ever been in its 175 year history”.Here are facts.  The government has already announced removing the betting levy - a 4 percent tax on annual betting profit.  Last year’s racing bill also enacted a Point of Consumption charge, and the offshore user charge. RITA is already reaching commercial arrangements on the user charges – more revenue.Once these revenue streams have come into full effect there will be about $25 million in additional revenue for the industry. This isn't just theoretical - the TAB is already ring-fencing betting duty savings for the industry.Intellectual PropertyIt has been claimed the new bill is “stealing the crown jewels - intellectual property” from the codes.This is not correct. What the bill offers is in effect a continuation of the status quo for IP.  The TAB will be negotiating the aggregate IP for the all codes. Fragmenting your IP will cost you money not make you money. No IP has been stolen from anyone.Governance It has been claimed racing needs “its own Magna Carta” and the bill is about “total control by the Minister with Marxist-type bureaucratic regulatory control”Not correct. Many of the Ministerial functions already exist in current law.  And the bill transfers racing functions to the codes while RITA will no longer exist. And concerns about Ministerial functions are misplaced. They can be triggered at the request of a code to help resolve problems, such as racetrack consolidation.More is being done for this industry over the last 18 months than has been done in decades.The industry wanted a review and a change of governance to the NZ Racing Board – it is being provided.The industry wanted tax relief measures. It is being provided.The industry wanted other revenue sources. It is being provided.The industry want to address racetrack consolidation – and the means and mechanism to do so is being provided.While some of you may want to write a racing “Magna Carta” this government seeks to create genuine change.Those who doubt this should ask themselves the question – “where would the industry be if the status quo was allowed to prevail?”Dean McKenzie from RITA has been talking to many of you in the industry and he has good information for which you should keep an open mind.The Government said it will change this industry for the better and we are. There is still much work to do, but we are committed to seeing through the reform of the racing industry so that the industry is revitalised, healthy and financially viable. On the following issues remember there is a Racing Bill before Parliament with submissions closing on the 11th of February. Whether it is Race Fields/Point of Consumption or provision to be made for ‘flow through’ to the codes officials are already working with the Select Committee about addressing this.Or on the codes needing to have representation on the Board of TAB NZ.  We hear you but surely we don’t want to go back to where things were in 2003.  We’re looking at ways to ensure that the heart of this industry gains control of its destiny. Or on the need for separation of TAB NZ and Government.  ‘An outsourcing decision is a commercial decision in the best interests of the industry’. That’s the claim but if an outsourcing decision ends up in an asset sale where would we have got ourselves? However, let’s flip that on its head and consider a caveat to what the Government will not approve i.e. the industry allowed to reach any outsourcing or JV arrangement as long as it is not an asset sale beyond a certain threshold.Submissions close on the 11th of February.  We’re here to listen and I trust every critic of this legislation has made their submission.For these reasons, you should remain confident about this great sport.And we all look forward to contributing to as well as celebrating the future successes of the next generation of Karaka graduates.Again, enjoy your time at Karaka and good luck to those buying and selling.It is a pleasure to declare the 2020 National Yearling Sales open.And see you again next year.Ends"

Turuki! from Te Uepū Hāpai I te Ora, and Te Tangi o te Manawanui: Recommendations for Reform from the Chief Victims Advisor, along with the reports released earlier this year Inaia Tonu Nei and He Waka Roimata tell us there is much we need to do if we want our criminal justice system to be safe and effective and if we want to change what it does for the better.These reports are not a blueprint. But they draw on community input and the message is clear: we need a different approach. We need humanity for victims and greater effectiveness for offenders.The challenges we face now have been decades in the making. And many are not of the criminal justice system itself. I'll come back to this later.On the system itself, we continue to unquestioningly accept some aspects of the way things are done, things which, by any definition, are out of date. One of those is the role and place of victims in the criminal justice system.No one challenges the orthodoxy of the Crown taking responsibility for prosecuting those who do harm. That is part of the social contract.The burden of seeking accountability for harmful and anti-social conduct should not be the victim’s.Nor is there any argument to abandon longstanding principles such as the presumption of innocence and the onus of proof on the Crown. In the end these are protections for the innocent. They are protections against the state from exercising its powers in an over-bearing and abusive way.But the way the system applies these principles can look from the outside like it is a system geared almost entirely to the needs of the offender. Yes, it is the offender, after all, who at the end of the process, stands to lose their liberty, but there is also the victim – the person who is in the system through no choice they have made. It is the victim who will have suffered physically, emotionally and psychologically. The victim has a huge stake in what happens.In this day and age, we have a much better understanding of the impact of offending on victims. For many victims, the trauma of being harmed or invaded is just the start. They are drawn into a process that is alien and alienating, and often just downright intimidating. Many are left feeling unsafe and unsupported. Many say they, as victims, do not get justice.Even after 30 years of greater advocacy for victims of crime and improvements in support for them, there are still gaps in the support we provide. The more we leave victims unsupported the greater the psychological and emotional harm the system can cause.Of every $100 spent in the criminal justice system today, just 50 cents is spent on direct support for victims.We know today that dealing with trauma and preventing prolonged grief requires respect and understanding, and importantly a voice. That is not happening effectively for too many victims.This government is committed to strengthening the role and place of victims in our criminal justice system. It is vital we do so for the sake of the justice system, and for public confidence in it.It is possible to do so without compromising the important protections we have for the innocent, as we have done recently for victims of sexual violence.We recently changed the law to improve how victims of sexual violence give evidence in court and how they are treated at trial. The aim is to make the experience of giving evidence and being the subject of questioning less traumatising.But there is more we can do for victims generally, so that all victims are given due consideration throughout. We are committed to making these changes over time.One of the changes we can make is with our courthouses and the environment in which justice is actually administered. Next Monday I will announce a project to deal with just this question.One of the most important changes in approach we need to make is accepting that for many offenders – indeed, for most of them - their offending is the consequence of a bunch of factors. True, their offending is their choice, and they must be responsible for it. But those choices are in many cases predictable because of personal circumstances.If we accept that, then it is possible to think about dealing with offending – so that we can stop it – by dealing with those factors that lead to bad choices.As I said, this will be the case for many offenders. But not for all. Even as we explore the future, for for more effective ways of calling offenders to account and intervening to stop future offending, there are those whose offending is calculated and deliberate, and for whom prison, the ultimate sanction, is the best place for them for the safety of the community.Of those prisoners whose offending we might describe as predictable, you’ve only got to look at what we know about the current prison population:62 per cent of prisoners have been diagnosed with a mental illness or substance abuse disorder;	 52 per cent of women and 22 per cent of men are assessed as having Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder;	 60 per cent of prisoners have literacy or numeracy below NCEA level one, and many have usually dropped out of school at an early age;	 Many have experienced physical violence, and 53 per cent of women prisoners have experienced sexual violence.These are the figures for those in prison. There is no reason to believe that those passing through the whole of the justice system are not similarly affected.Looking at these figures, I go back to what I said at the very beginning and say our long term solutions don’t just lie with the criminal justice system. Effective early interventions in education and health are necessary. That is why this government has invested so heavily in learning support coordinators and in mental health and addiction in this year's Budget.Against this background, we have been locking up offenders at an unprecedented rate. And yet, our re-offending rate has remained largely unchanged for more than 20 years.It’s pretty clear what we’ve been allowing our system to do for a large chunk of our offenders. We take wrecked lives. And we wreck them a little bit more.It’s not reducing serious crime. It’s not making our communities safer.This government wants to change that. We have already started.Under Corrections Minister Kelvin Davis’ leadership, and as part of the Hōkai Rangi programme, more effort is being made to deal with the problems prisoners have that is part of their offending.It might be health issues. It might be skills and whether they can hold down a job. It might be learned behaviours, like violence. It might be not having a suitable place to live on release. It might be family relationships. It might be a sense of identity – or the loss of it, because of generations of being denied whakapapa.If we can fix these issues and restore stability, identity and a stake in the community, we will have a better chance of stopping re-offending. That means fewer victims and safer communities.It is right that offenders are held to account for the harm they do. But for many, the best chance we have to stop future offending and make communities safer is to give them a chance to re-join society as a better person with something to give back.So what we do in the prison system is vital. It is our last chance in the system to help troubled people change.But it cannot be the only place in the system where people who make bad choices and cause harm get help.The entry point to the criminal justice system is the Police. What the Police do, and how they do their job, is also vital.Commissioner Mike Bush, with the support of Minister Stuart Nash, has led the way on a new style of policing under the Prevention First: National Operating Model. Within Prevention First, Police have Te Huringa o Te Tai, the plan to reduce Māori offending by 25 per cent by 2025. It is about changing mind-sets – the Police’s and the community’s – and seeking partnership.The Police also have Te Pae Oranga: Iwi Community Panels, a community response to some offending to get offenders off a track to a bleaker future in the criminal justice system.And of course, what the courts do is vital.Judges often say to me they wished there were more options at their disposal to provide the means to help offenders change.We know there are backlogs and delays in the system now, and this year we funded places for another 10 District Court judges and two Youth Court judges to deal with this.We’ve also had a longstanding pilot of two Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment Courts, operating in Waitakere and Auckland.An evaluation earlier this year confirmed  in relation to those courts that within two years:23 per cent of offenders going through the courts were less likely to offend for any offence;	 35 per cent were less likely to re-offend for a serious offence;	 25 per cent were less likely to be imprisoned because of re-offending.The judges leading these courts say they have continually refined and changed what they do, and their results have been getting steadily better.On the basis of this, the government is announcing today that it will make the two pilot courts in Auckland permanent.In addition to that, we will establish an AODT court in Waikato next year.There is strong community support in Hamilton for an AODT court there.Initially the courts will be funded out of the Proceeds of Crime Fund before costs are absorbed into Ministry of Justice baselines.More AODT courts will be be rolled out in other cities over time.The Government is committed over time to the establishment of more therapeutic courts such as the Matariki, New Beginnings and Special Circumstances courts, as well as specialist courts such as the Sexual Violence Court. Pilots of all of these courts have shown positive results from more effective interventions.There is another essential challenge we must rise to as we head into a different future.We know Māori are way over-represented in our criminal justice system.What’s not as widely acknowledged is that Māori are way over-represented amongst victims too.Our response to this cannot be to plan for this being a permanent feature. However, to the best extent it can, our criminal justice system can play its part in restoring identity, restoring mana, and strengthening whanaungatanga.But the long term answer to the wholly disproportionate representation of Māori will lie in a lot of different areas, not the least of which is continuing the journey to restore the mana of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/the Treaty of Waitangi through effective partnership relationships.Drawing Māori in and drawing on Mātauranga Māori across the whole justice system will be an important step. The Government is committed to exploring how we do this.The reports released today provide an important foundation for a different future for our criminal justice system.Reducing offending and re-offending, and making our communities safer are paramount.Strengthening the voice and place of victims of crime in the system is vital.And responding more effectively to the troubled people who enter our justice system, wherever they came into contact with it, is essential.I conclude with this point. There are differing views across the political spectrum on how to respond to the challenges of the criminal justice system and making our communities safer.Although, possibly the views don’t differ that much. For example, our friends in the National Party are seeking feedback on a policy that would see therapeutic services offered to prisoners on remand. Typically, remand prisoners don’t get much in the way of help, such as addiction services, because they haven’t been found guilty of an offence yet.  But if they need help, they should get it. And they should get it on the basis that doing so doesn’t constitute an admission of guilt on their part.We agree with the National Party on this.When I look around at other parts of the world where criminal justice reform has taken place, it has been most sensibly done on a bi-partisan basis.The United States has done this at a federal level and in some states. This time last year, Republicans and Democrats in Congress, in a deal brokered by the President, passed the First Step Act which funded new programmes in federal prisons to assist prisoners on release. Federal prison numbers have been falling since.In Texas, a similar thing happened, although it started a few year ago. Ten years ago, Texas had 15 youth detention facilities. As a result of far-sighted and bi-partisan decisions, it now has just four. And crime is falling.We’ve seen political bidding wars over criminal justice over the past 30 years in New Zealand. It has led us to where we are today. It has cost our country billions. And our re-offending rate is unchanged.This Government remains committed to effective changes that turn offenders’ lives around, reduce offending and make our communities safer. That’s what matters most.And we will make change at a pace the community understands, and in a way that keeps their confidence.I hope our colleagues across the House will join us in this challenge that I know we all care about. I invite them to do so.And I’m calling on you, the thought leaders in this room, to join with us too.Nō reira, tēnā kotou, tēnā kotou, tēnā tatou katoa.Thank you.Update 12 December 2019 at 11.04am to reflect changes at delivery."

It will happen because of countless actions taken by governments, cities, towns and local communities around the world. Actions that, together, can add up to a stable climate for all of us. That is the international system at work.With the Paris Agreement soon to take effect, it is more important than ever that we agree a system of cooperation and environmental integrity worthy of the promise laid out in Article 6. If we can put that in place, then there is a pathway for us to raise climate ambition and lower costs, whilst engaging the private sector and spreading finance, technology and expertise into new areas.Standing with the Pacific Pacific nations are among those most at risk from climate change and among those with the least resources to adapt. Rising sea levels, ocean acidification and catastrophic cyclones are just some of the consequences threatening Pacific peoples’ livelihoods and ability to provide for their families.The Paris Agreement’s commitment to seek to limit global temperature increases to 1.5˚C is of utmost importance to all nations, but for many of our Pacific neighbours its importance is existential.Like any family we have a responsibility to look out for one another. At least two thirds of New Zealand’s $300 million of climate related support between 2019 and 2022 will be provided to Pacific nations.And we are proud to welcome Tokelau as a valued part of our delegation here in Madrid. Ulu tonu mai.  New Zealand’s Climate ActionFive weeks ago, we passed through Parliament, with bipartisan support, legislation committing ourselves – and all future governments – to significant domestic greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Our Zero Carbon Act enshrines the 1.5˚C temperature threshold into primary legislation. It establishes a system of emissions budgets that will act as stepping stones towards a long-term target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We have also introduced specific measures to drive down our climate damaging emissions – including reform of our Emissions Trading Scheme; billions of dollars of investment in rail, buses, cycling and walking infrastructure; and the planting of one billion trees. Internationally, we continue to advocate for fossil fuel subsidies reform. And we have contributed $15 million over four years to the first replenishment of the Green Climate Fund, a five-fold increase over our previous contribution. ConclusionWe know that lasting action on climate change demands that we keep working every single day. For this is the only way we can keep our promise to you - that we will leave behind a world that is better off for what we did. No reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tatou katoa."

The volcanic eruptions on White Island have claimed 5 lives, and left 31 in critical condition. A further 8 people are still missing.A number of you here today represent those agencies working on the recovery response. We would like to acknowledge those efforts, alongside Police, Fire and Emergency NZ, the New Zealand Defence Force, health professionals, first responders, and a number of private individuals involved with this response. Our thoughts go out to the families and friends of those affected by this event, and to those in hospital. IntroductionIn the wake of tragedy, we can only reiterate the importance of this landmark moment today. New Zealand and the broader region are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters.We face significant tsunami risks, and the consequences of such a catastrophe has been seen before in countries such as Japan and Thailand.It is vital for New Zealand to have adequate warning systems in place.Just over a year ago, we learnt that New Zealand was reliant on a single, aging, US-owned DART buoy to detect whether a tsunami is generated following an earthquake.The inadequacy of this for a region so at risk cannot be overstated.To then learn the extent of which New Zealand was left totally unprepared and entirely jeopardised because the former government wouldn’t find the funding is shocking.However, having learned of the appalling crisis we were facing, we realised it was essential to act right there, right then. We have not wasted one day in getting this network ordered, provisioned and set up. We have acquired the funding required to not only build and deploy these buoys, but to set up a 24/7 monitoring system.DART buoys are the most accurate and time-sensitive warning equipment available worldwide. When strategically placed across key areas of the Pacific, these buoys will create a network that will have benefits beyond comprehension. Not only for New Zealand, but also for our Pacific neighbours.Tsunamis that hit Pacific countries not only cause death and destruction, but widespread economic devastation that can take years to recover from. New Zealand is always the first to offer support to our Pacific partners in the wake of such natural disasters. The DART buoy network will provide tsunami monitoring and detection information for Pacific countries, including Tokelau, Niue, the Cook Islands, Samoa and Tonga as well as New Zealand.  New Zealand’s investment in this system is a very practical way we can help ourselves and our partner governments in the Pacific provide accurate tsunami warnings for coastal communities. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre will use data the buoys generate to provide timely warnings to Pacific countries.Working in partnership with our neighbours to be more resilient to natural disasters is a manifestation of the commitment we began under the Pacific Reset. The cost of the DART buoys network has not been met by New Zealand alone. Australia has provided a contribution of A$2.5 million to this important system. As our closest friend and ally we are continually grateful for the support Australia gives New Zealand. We are very glad to see that this support extends to our work in the Pacific. It is seriously welcome to see these first DART Buoys on board today, ready to take their place in the Pacific Ocean where they will work to protect the lives of both New Zealanders and of those in the wider pacific.END"

Thank you too to all the stakeholders and interested parties who have contributed ideas and thinking to it.“Making best practice, standard practice” is a great framework for change and the action plan in the report will help achieve the systems change that is needed.Like the Prime Minister I also receive a lot of correspondence on plastics. Recently a group has turned to sending plastic rubbish to MPs to highlight the need for more and faster action on plastics. We’ve received so enough envelopes of plastic that the creative staff in my office team decided to upcycle them and make them into a Christmas tree with a strong waste-free message; so no tinsel in our office.As the Prime Minister has highlighted, kids get it.  Recently, I received a letter from nine-year-old Hugh in Te Puke which resonated and highlights why this work is so important. Here’s what Hugh said:“... I am worried about all the rubbish on our wonderful planet. I am worried that all the animals both on land and sea and birds that fly are dying because there is a lot of plastic around where they live and they think it is food and eat it. When they eat the plastic it can cause them to choke and die, or get very sick.  I do not want to see all animals die. Our family loves animals and except for pests we want to be able to enjoy animals. … One weekend when I went to the beach to collect driftwood we saw a lot of rubbish on the beach. I picked up the rubbish and took it home.The beach and the ocean are not places for rubbish.”Hugh is right. There is too much plastic in our streams and oceans, washing up on our beaches, and lasting for decades in landfills when it may have been used once, for mere minutes.It is letters like Hugh’s and the vivid images of plastic and other rubbish spread over kilometres of riverbed and coast after floodwaters eroded the closed Fox River landfill earlier this year that confirm there is no magic place called “away” for rubbish when we put things in the bin.   It’s an issue that past governments neglected for far too long. In the two years since we’ve been in Government, we’ve been getting to work tackling New Zealand’s mounting waste problem. We’ve already banned single-use plastic shopping bags and microbeads and today’s announcement reaffirms and extends our ambitious plan to reduce waste to landfill. That plan includes:Designing a container return scheme for beverage bottles and cans. This will increase the recovery of drink bottles and cans so that the materials they are made of, such as aluminium and plastic can be re-cycled, reducing litter and waste.It includes regulated product stewardship schemes for products such as e-waste, tyres and batteries to designing waste out of the system from the get-go and ensure these products are dealt with appropriately at the end of their life, materials recovered and reprocessed rather than ending up at the landfill.A National Resource Recovery work programme is underway in response to China and other countries’ bans on importing waste and recyclables.  The plan includes improving waste data so we have a better picture of where waste is coming from and where it’s going. Sustainable Coastlines has been doing great work here, enabling those involved in beach clean-ups to contribute statistically robust information on litter pollution on beaches. A major initiative is expanding and improving the landfill levy to help fund more facilities here in Aotearoa and more ways to recover, re-use and reprocess materials including construction and demolition materials, glass and cardboard and paper; creating jobs in the process.And there the $40 million Provincial Growth Fund investment to turn plastic and other waste into useful material for businesses and consumers.A lot of plastic waste doesn’t need to be created in the first place. And signalling moving away from the hard to recycle materials drives innovation. Our goal must be to make Aotearoa an economy where plastic rarely becomes waste or pollution. As Prof. Gerrard says there is no silver bullet and we need a systems change. The recommendations in this report and the information behind them will help us to achieve this.As the Prime Minister has said, as a government we’re taking on board the recommendations in Professor Gerrard’s report to build on our ambitious plan by: Setting goals to shift away from low-value and hard-to-recycle plastic.Our first target will be to move away from single-use packaging and beverage containers made of hard-to-recycle PVC and polystyrene. Examples include polystyrene meat trays, styrofoam cups and takeaway food containers. We will work towards ensuring that these are made of high-value alternatives like PET, HDPE and polypropylene, which can be recycled and reprocessed.We will phase out some single-use plastic items such as plastic cutlery, cotton buds, fruit stickers and plastic stirrers – replacing them with sustainable alternatives.We will stimulate innovation and development of solutions to the soft plastic problem.We will accelerate work underway with local government and industry to achieve a more integrated and consistent kerbside collection of recyclables and more reprocessing infrastructure.With industry, we will continue work to develop a labelling scheme for packaging, including plastic packaging Today’s announcement is about signalling the direction we’re heading in response to Prof Gerrard’s Rethinking Plastics report.  I have asked the energetic and hard-working team in the Ministry for the Environment to prepare a full and considered government response to the report with a view to having that plan decided by Cabinet within six months. Now I know some people may want more action faster and wonder why we can’t just ban problem plastics overnight. But what I’ve found in this job is that by signalling our direction of travel, innovative businesses will often take action while the regulations catch up. We saw that with plastic shopping bags where New Zealanders responded by taking their own re-useable bags and supermarkets phased them out before the ban coming into force. And one of the pleasures of my job is getting to visit innovative businesses and community groups around the country who are already designing the solutions we need. For example, Flight Plastics in Lower Hutt has been making food packaging from recycled plastic PET bottles for a number of years thanks to the assistance from the landfill levy revenue via the waste minimisation fund. And a company here in Auckland, Alto Packaging (Pact Group) are already making cleverly designed trays for meat made of recyclable PET to help rid supermarkets of expanded polystyrene meat trays and the plastic liner.  As litter and waste polystyrene breaks into pieces - it’s some of the worst material to end up in the ocean as marine life mistake the pieces for food. Many solutions already exist and as we set our minds as a country to solving what remains we’ll stimulate innovation, create well-paid jobs, and be able to export that kiwi ingenuity to the world. "
2019-12-07T04:11:20Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Phil Twyford                    ,  Speech to Government Economics Network 2019 Conference,"I want to talk about one of the most pressing issues in our national life: the housing crisis and the poor performance of our cities.The argument I want to make to you is that generations of urban land use policy have lacked a decent grounding in economics. The consequences of that have been disastrous. And if we want to turn it around it is going to take bold reform and policies informed by an understanding of urban spatial economics.The housing crisis has been relentless: the sheer scale of homelessness, poor quality rentals, falling home ownership, out of control housing costs, increased inequality, and intergenerational unfairness. I am sure for many it feels too big to fix, and the public debate is often clouded by single issue advocates.In my view, only an explanation that looks at supply and demand can make sense of it.Over the last two decades our housing market has experienced an accumulation of demand pressures, mainly population growth but compounded by tax settings that have encouraged a generation of investors to see rental properties as a uniquely desirable asset class.Add to those demand pressures, abundant cheap mortgage credit particularly after the GFC when quantitative easing and lower interest rates saw vast amounts of low cost capital inflating asset bubbles all over the world.Now if our land and housing markets were elastic, and able to respond to demand we might have seen supply ramp up.Unfortunately those markets don’t respond well to demand.I think there are three main reasons for that. Restrictive planning rules stop the city expanding on the fringes creating an artificial scarcity of land, and height and density rules stop the city growing up, effectively rationing floor space.I want to give a hat tip at this point to Harvard professor Ed Glaeser who wrote Triumph of the City, one of the best explanations of how restrictive planning rules damage our cities and hurt the young and the less well-off.The second factor that stops our markets responding to demand is a broken system for financing infrastructure that delays or prevents developments going ahead.The third factor is a construction industry with low productivity and dominated by small and medium enterprises, that finds it very difficult to scale up in response to demand.The effect of these three things is that we have a more or less fixed supply of land and floor space.Under these conditions: rising demand, abundant credit, and a fixed supply of land and floor space, it is not surprising that house prices doubled in our biggest city and then doubled again over the last two decades.And while only an economic explanation can make sense of this, it is also true that the consequences of this market dysfunction have had a harmful systemic effect on the health of our urban economies.The housing crisis and the gridlock on our roads make us poorer.PwC released a report on cities earlier this year that showed Auckland was the only city in Australasia to have experienced a significant drop in discretionary household incomes over the last decade. An average drop of some $5000 per household, at a time of sustained economic growth largely because of housing and transport costs.This at a time when Brisbane, comparable to Auckland in growth rates and quality of life, experienced an increase in disposable household income of $20,000 over the same period.We have lost our urban competitiveness because of spiralling housing and transport costs.To get to the bottom of this problem, and to find solutions, we need to understand the spatial economics of cities.I am indebted here to Alain Bertaud whose most recent book Order Without Design best articulates his view about cities as labour markets.If you love cities that view might seem a bit reductionist, but it is a pretty good description. A well-functioning labour market makes possible every other aspect of urban life.Large, dense and deep labour markets are more productive because of economies of scale, and knowledge spill overs stimulate innovation.However the potential economic advantages of cities can only be realised if workers, consumers and suppliers are able to exchange their labour, products and ideas with minimum friction.If cities do not build efficient transport networks mobility reduces, the effective size of the labour market shrinks because commuting times increase, the benefits of agglomeration are lost, and productivity drops.Similarly if housing is so expensive people cannot afford to live close to where the jobs are, the same things happen.Consider the effect on the country’s labour productivity of two-thirds of Kiwis not being able to afford to buy into the Auckland housing market and thus not being available for the city’s jobs. Real estate is so expensive it distorts the allocation of labour and capital to the detriment of our productive economy.The efficient operation of the labour market requires affordability and mobility. These two things must be the primary objectives of urban policy. I now want to look in a little more depth at housing and land markets, and transport.I started by saying urban planning has lacked an economic underpinning. An example of this is the use of the urban growth boundary which is a common planning tool ostensibly to stop cities growing outwards, often described pejoratively as sprawl.Sprawl is often meant as development on the fringes of a city, far from the centre. But I want to make the point that the better way to think of it is in relation to the time value of travel.If you are building homes let us say in Pukekohe in the south of Auckland, where people who work in the city centre might face a drive of 90 minutes on a bad day, that might be characterised as sprawl. But when we electrify the rail line to Pukekohe, and build an additional line on the main north-south corridor, as we are about to do, those people will have a 30 min express commuter ride into the city, is it sprawl then? I don’t think so.The most harmful effect of the urban growth boundary where there is rising demand is to create an artificial scarcity of land driving section prices up.The boundary is much loved by land bankers whose business model is to buy up rural land and sit on it until the local council shifts the boundary in response to growth pressures, changing the zoning from rural to urban, and then sell it sometimes at ten times its former value.My intention is not to vilify land bankers. Their behaviour is a rational response to bad policy.If the urban growth boundary wasn’t bad enough, restrictions on height and density, often justified as protecting the amenity of the low-rise garden suburb, ration floor space, stopping the city growing up and restricting the supply of apartments, and of course driving up prices across the market.Urban planning has too often failed to grasp that whenever rules stop people building or living in places they want to (typically close to amenity, jobs or transport interchanges) they deny people housing choices, restrict supply and drive prices up.As Ed Glaiser says, every time you place a restriction on intensification you deny a family access to the city.This is one part of the story of our cities. The other is about mobility.Our cities in large part grew into their current form in the latter half of the twentieth century, having consciously adopted an American-style development pattern based on private car ownership which enabled low density suburban expansion connected by motorways and roads.This model has for some time now exceeded its limits.As Auckland got larger the sheer distances made commutes longer and longer, in Bertaud’s terms shrinking the labour market.The weakness of a model that relies so heavily on cars and roads, with decades of under-investment in public transport, has been exposed. Induced demand means that every new road, every lane added to a motorway, magically fills up with cars. Without options of course everyone drives. Morning and afternoon peaks are jammed, and we have some of the highest rates of car ownership in the world.The counter-factual, seen in many overseas cities, and in specific examples like Auckland’s Northern Busway and Wellington’s commuter rail service, is that when you have efficient public transport alongside the motorways and roads, you get a kind of dynamic equilibrium where some people choose to leave their cars at home and take the train, allowing the roads to move more freely. The reverse applies. When public transport is slow or inefficient people choose to drive which causes congestion which slows down the roads. So in this way, the efficiency and speed of public transport is what determines the speed and efficiency of the roading network.Since the marginal cost of driving a car (that is the cost to the efficiency of the road network of adding one more driver) can be up to 30 times greater than the average cost, investing in quality public transport improvements can benefit both public transport users and private vehicle users.The other thing that has caught up with the car-centric urban model is the sheer inefficiency of devoting so much of our scarce and expensive urban real estate to cars (and parking).The average price of land in Auckland’s central city is $16,000/sq m, and in Welllington it is $6500/sq m. The opportunity cost of land in our most productive places is too high to continue to devote so much of it to single occupant vehicles.Public transport and rapid transit can move people through our cities using a fraction of the space taken up by single occupant vehicles.An example is the Auckland rail network that will, once the City Rail Link is complete, be able to carry 54,000 people (the equivalent of 16 lanes of motorway traffic) in and out of the city centre every hour.So given all that, what are we doing about these problems?In housing we’ve tried to rein in the excessive demand forces by changing the tax settings: shutting down negative gearing, and pushing the bright line out to five years.We also banned foreign speculators from buying existing homes.On the supply side, we want to foster competitive urban land markets by allowing private long-term debt finance to be used to build the roads and pipes to support urban growth.Developments are not going ahead because the high growth Councils are up against their debt limits and yet there is a limitless pool of capital that would love to invest in the growth of our cities.Through a National Policy Statement under the RMA we are going to direct Councils to free up their planning rules to make room for growth, both up and out, with the aim of massively expanding the number of development opportunities in the market.That is also one of the drivers of David Parker’s RMA reform process. David is fond of saying there are only three things wrong with the RMA: it takes too long, it is too expensive, and it hasn’t done a great job of protecting the environment. I think that certainly applies to the RMA in the urban environment.We have established Kainga Ora – Homes and Communities, an urban development authority. We are now legislating its powers so it can lead large scale urban development projects, building whole new communities at pace.And of course the Government is doing its bit to increase supply through the state house build, and Kiwibuild. We are building more homes right now than any government has since the 1970s.Kiwibuild has taken longer to ramp up than we intended, and it is increasingly clear innovations like off-site manufacturing and Kainga Ora’s large scale projects are needed.In transport we are investing record amounts in building and maintaining roads, rail and public transport.In Auckland alongside the Council we committed to a 10-year $28 billion programme of investments in the transport system.We are retrofitting our cities with rapid transit and modern public transport so their networks can absorb the growth pressures and the congestion peaks with Rapid Transit acting as a pressure valve. It is the only sustainable solution to gridlock.And we are taking a more market responsive and integrated approach to planning our cities. Instead of arguing over pet projects we are developing, central and local government together, 30 year plans that treat the city as a complex system, looking at all the things we need to do to make it succeed.Planning should be an enabler of markets, not an inhibitor of markets.It’s pretty simple really. We want you to get home to your family quickly and safely at the end of the day.And we want everyone to be decently housed.If we get the policy settings right, and deliver both affordability and mobility, the New Zealand city will be productive, inclusive and sustainable.Planning our cities without economic thinking has got us into this mess.Good policy informed by urban spatial economics will help get us out of it."

But in the spirit of Selwyn, I am going to get you to choose later on in the speech, so listen out.As Minister of Finance every day I am faced with difficult choices. And I mean more than just at Bellamys. There is much to do. Nine years of neglect to overcome in our schools, hospitals and state houses.Big, complex, long-term issues like climate change, homelessness and child poverty to address. And the unexpected things that come at you like the response to March 15.We work hard to get the balance right.  Understanding the global environment, making investments now for the good of future generations, and managing the books carefully while taking the bold innovative steps that are needed.I approach those important decisions on a clear basis, guided by the values of our Party and our movement.  It is our job to strive for social justice, for equality and equity, to protect our planet and our people for the common good.And I am guided by all of you.  Our Labour whanau.  By the policies that you pass, the mahi that you do, the people who you are. I think of the members and supporters who have gone before, and to those who have recently passed. In my own rohe, I think of David Underwood and Fran McGrath, both of whom we have lost recently.  People who would always think of others first, who’s strong sense of fairness and justice helped guide me.  I thank them, on whose shoulders we all stand. And I thank all of you for your commitment as we face these opportunities and challenges together.And delegates, you can be proud of the achievements we’ve made in our first two years in Government.We are rebuilding New Zealand. We are rebuilding the social services that were neglected for too long, like our teaching, health and Police workforces.We’re rebuilding regional roads, rail and transport infrastructure ignored by the previous Government.And we are rebuilding our frayed social fabric – what it means to be a New Zealander – a fair go, a helping hand, the spirit of manākitanga.One of the achievements I am most proud of is the Wellbeing Budget.At conference last year I stood up and gave you the first indication of what a Wellbeing Budget would deliver.I told you how our new way of doing Budgets meant we would use evidence of what would make the biggest difference to New Zealanders’ wellbeing now and in the future to decide what to invest in.I told you we would break down the silos of government to focus on the outcomes, not the inputs. And that we would measure our success not just on the narrow indicator of GDP, but also on the other things we value – the health and wellbeing of our people, the quality of our environment and the strengths of our communities.And fellow delegates – we did it.The Wellbeing Budget broke new ground.  Around the world and here at home it is generating huge interest.At the World Economic Forum in Davos this year I was so proud to hear our Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern tell the world how the Wellbeing Budget would work, and, more importantly, why it mattered.At home, the Waikato Councils, iwi and NGOs are coming together to undertake the Waikato Wellbeing Project to guide development in their region.  Deloitte ran an investigative series on wellbeing, the BNZ created their own wellbeing survey and index, while Westpac have been running regional wellbeing events around the country.We are changing the way people think about what we value, what constitutes success and what we invest in.There is still some way to go to see the approach work to its fullest. We need better recognition of Te Ao Maori, and of how our Pasifika community view wellbeing, including its spiritual aspects.  We need to get better indicators of our children’s wellbeing, of our cultural wellbeing.But we have made a great start.And nowhere was that more evident than in the package that was the centrepiece of the Wellbeing Budget – Taking Mental Health Seriously.We delivered. A $1.9 billion package to completely change how we provide frontline mental health services in this country. To change how we deal with the drivers of homelessness and addiction. To change how we break the cycle of reoffending by addressing mental health in our prison population. Breaking down the silos to finally put mental health at the centre of our health system.We have to thank those who have blazed the trail on this. Champions like Mike King, the Mental Health Foundation and John Kirwan.I am proud to be part of a Government that said this will be front-and-centre of our very first Wellbeing Budget.I have already seen the difference that is being made through the Piki programme providing free services to 18-24 year olds, through the amazing Mana Ake programme supporting young people in Christchurch, and the new facilities such as the one being built just down the road from here in Palmerston North.That’s what happens when you change the status quo and do things differently, by putting people at the heart of what we do as a Government.But there is of course more to do. An issue like mental health that was left on the sidelines over the past decade will not be fixed in just one Budget. The same applies to the other priorities in the Wellbeing Budget. They were identified on the basis of evidence.  They represent long-term challenges and opportunities: child wellbeing, Maori and Pasifika development, the future of work, our transition to a low carbon economy. They need sustained investmentWe will announce the full detail of the 2020 Budget priorities at the Budget Policy Statement in a couple of weeks’ time, but rest assured we are in this for the long haul, to do what is right, and to do what is needed.There are so many highlights from the Wellbeing Budget and what we have delivered this year, but I want to mention just a couple more that show that we are delivering on what we promised.The Budget contained a massive boost for KiwiRail – over $1 billion.  Now, I know in a place like Whanganui there are long memories about promises about rail.  This Government is setting that straight with real investment.It hit home to me just how much that meant when a KiwiRail line maintenance worker cried as he told me how he finally had the resources to do his job properly – keeping a safe and reliable rail network going.  He had seen his job undermined over a decade, and now it’s back on track.Closer to home for me – where I grew up in fact – is the Hillside Workshops in South Dunedin.I stood in front of you as Opposition Spokesperson and said we would get Hillside thriving again. And the coalition government is delivering that with a $20 million investment. I want to pay a tribute here to Clare Curran as MP for Dunedin South who never, ever gave up on Hillside or the workers who were there, and to the RMTU as well.This is not some nostalgic endeavour either.  This is about a modern engineering facility that supports highly skilled jobs. On that same day, we announced other Provincial Growth Fund investments in Dunedin, including a Centre of Digital Excellence and support for high value manufacturing in the city.This is all work towards building the economy of the future. Taking the themes of our Economic Plan of moving from volume to value, of improving our skills and seeing wages lift.  I want to thank New Zealand First for their work in the PGF.  It is a great example of the Coalition Government working together.Among the many other examples in the Wellbeing Budget, I want to especially highlight our transition to a low carbon economy.  There can be no better example of the change that is being brought by our Government than this.The environment is no longer some kind of after-thought, left to Nick Smith to mess up.  It is front and centre in our future prosperity and wellbeing.  In the Budget we saw a host of Ministers and agencies come together to produce the Sustainable Land Use Package.  This is practically assisting farmers and others in the primary industries to move to a more sustainable future.  It supports growing more trees, cleaning up our waterways, and measuring our impacts better and more.These transitions are not always easy.  When we announced our ban on new oil and gas exploration it would be fair to say the reception in places like New Plymouth was a bit chilly. But we stuck at it – and here I want to pay tribute to the Hon Megan Woods who has led this effort.Megan can now point to the establishment of the National Energy Development Centre, to the burgeoning hydrogen economy, to the new funding for cutting edge research and development that is supporting the transition of communities like Taranaki.Since our decision, we’ve seen major new windfarms and investment in geothermal. That’s exactly the long-term transition we are wanting to see.Recently when I was in the region talking with the business community – not one question on oil and gas. But rather a focus on the future and on the partnerships we can grow together.And most recently we saw the red letter day – the passing of the Zero Carbon Act.  A day when we put into law our commitments and how we will be held accountable for them. Here I want to acknowledge our confidence and supply partner, the Greens, and particularly James Shaw. Together we have put climate at the centre of our economy.  There is, again, much to do, but we have made a strong start.As I said, there could be so many more things to highlight, but one thing stands out.  We are living up to the wellbeing values we hold, in particular that the economy is a means to an end, not an end in itself.As I have said many times, our wellbeing approach does not mean we take a thriving economy for granted.  We need it – and we have worked hard to achieve it, with unemployment near record lows, and wage growth at its highest in a decade.There is no denying the challenging times in the global economy.  The combined effect of the US-China trade war, uncertainty over Brexit and instability around the world has led the slowdown of global growth.As an open export-based economy we are not immune to this slowdown. No one in the world that we compare ourselves to is growing at the rates they were two or three years ago. We cannot expect rates of growth to continue unabated in this part of the global economic cycle.We take pride in the stability that we are providing as a Government.Some said it would not last – but we are going strong. That stability is evident in the strong fundamentals of our economy.  The IMF and OECD have told us that our growth rates will continue to outperform the countries we compare ourselves to – like Australia – and that we are well ahead of the average for other advanced economies.The Government’s books are in good shape. When we came into office, net debt was nearly 23% of GDP. Within our first year in office we reduced net debt below 20%.In our second year in Government, we made sure it stayed there.In our two years, we have run $13 billion worth of surpluses. We have got the books into shape. They will stay in shape.It is these strong fundamentals that now allow us to respond as economic circumstances change.We began this in Budget 2019.  We significantly lifted spending on all the core elements of our programme – health, education, infrastructure, and more.And now as we move into our third year, we will seek to build on that againThe investments we’ve been making should be of no surprise to anyone who knows the history of New Zealand Governments.Labour in Government builds New Zealand.Whether that’s in terms of our social infrastructure – from state houses to social security from free education to paid parental leave, or the infrastructure of roads and rail around the country.Each of our Labour Governments has left a legacy in terms of how they built New Zealand.We take this legacy very seriously. This is a legacy of investment in our people, our communities, our environment, and our economy.The key to making these investments is knowing when to make them.New Zealanders are rightly proud of the work being done in building up our schools, hospitals and transport networks. But the reality is that the investment needed to maintain that did not happen in the recent years.Take health – in 2016 no new money was put aside for capital expenditure. In 2017 it was just $100 million. That is how we ended up with the stories of Middlemore, and the sewerage and mould in its walls.We are closing that deficit.  In our first Budget we put $750 million in to fix our hospitals. We followed that up with $850 million for each of the next two years.In housing, we were left with a deficit of about 71,000 homes, with very few affordable homes being built over that time. At the same time – in the middle of a housing crisis – the National Government was busy selling off state houses.Well we stopped that, and we are closing that deficit.  We have built 3,623 state houses since we came in to office. A further 2,400 are under construction as we speak. Annual building consents for state houses are the highest for any Government since the 1970s.It is the same case in transport education and other sectors.We prioritised these investments because they are the ones that needed to be made after so many years of neglect.But looking forward, we believe now is the right time to build on Labour’s legacy, and build on the record of this Coalition Government.Right now, we can borrow at an interest rate of 1.3% for ten years. Just think about that for a minute. When we came in to office, this was up at 3%.We have the lowest borrowing costs in New Zealand’s history, so it is time to invest.In terms of where we are in the economic cycle, in terms of the good shape that the Government’s books are in; now is the time to take the next step forward in our legacy of building New Zealand.I can announce today that the Government will significantly increase spending on infrastructure.Cabinet has agreed in recent weeks to a package of infrastructure projects that we will bringing forward into our short and medium term programme.I would like to acknowledge the input from our Coalition and Confidence and Supply partners as we bring this together.We are currently finalising the specific projects that the package will fund but I can tell you this – it will be significant. It will have a direct impact on growth and it will create jobs, especially I hope for our young people.We are also listening to calls from the construction industry for greater certainty about the pipeline of transport projects from 18 months’ time. We will give that certainty.We will be in a position to outline the size of the capital investment package and the areas we will be investing in when we announce the Budget Policy Statement on the 11 December.Delegates, I said at the beginning of the speech that I would offer you my own version of ‘It’s in the Bag’ here in Whanganui.It’s a choice between our vision for the economy, where people are at the centre, where we value our environment and our communities, and where we strike a balance between the needs of here and now and those of future generations.On the other side is a view of the economy as the end goal itself, where the sights are set firmly in the rear view mirror, avoiding action on climate change, letting inequality grow and where the only hope is for the trickle down to finally take hold.So, what do you say Whanganui?Are you on the side of the future?Are you on the side of a prosperous, low carbon economy?Are you on the side of rebuilding New Zealand?Are you on the side of our people?If you are, then we are on this journey together.  It will take time. We must bring people with us to make sure this change endures.  But endure it will.It is the legacy of Labour in Government to build New Zealand. We have made a great start. Let’s get on with the job."

And time hasn’t necessarily diminished any of that.257 people died on the slopes of Mt Erebus on 28 November 1979, 40 years ago today.  Let me pause to acknowledge the enormity of that loss, and the effect it has had on the lives of the families – and also on the lives of those who took part in Operation Overdue.That loss, in and of itself, was huge.  It sent ripples across the country, and trauma that those who weren’t directly affected would probably struggle to fathom. But that loss and grief was compounded.  It was undeniably worsened by the events that followed.While today is a day for reflection, I feel we will serve you poorly if we don’t recognise what has stood in the way, for so many years, of you all having the space to grieve, to mourn and to reflect on the lives of your family members.Today, of all days, I hope we can say the things that should have been said.I don’t need to tell all of you that the accident we are marking today was the subject of two official reports. The first, by the Chief Inspector of Air Accidents, Mr Ron Chippendale, was published on 12 June 1980.  It concluded that the ‘probable cause’ of the disaster was pilot error.  I know this finding magnified the grief of many families, particularly devastating the families of the pilots.The second report, the product of a Royal Commission of Inquiry presided over by a High Court Judge, Justice Mahon, was presented to the Governor-General on 16 April 1981.  Justice Mahon rejected pilot error as the cause of the disaster.  Instead, he found that the dominant and effective cause of the accident was the airline’s actions in reprogramming the aircraft’s navigation system without advising the aircrew.More controversially, however, the Judge went on to find that witnesses from Air New Zealand had conspired to give false evidence to his inquiry.  This led to his report being severely criticised by both Air New Zealand and the then Prime Minister.  When the airline took judicial review proceedings, both the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council found the Judge’s findings of conspiracy and deception unsupported and contrary to the principles of natural justice.But what was lost in all this was the fact that no challenge was made to the Judge’s findings as to the cause of the accident.  On the contrary, the Law Lords placed on record their tribute to the brilliant and painstaking investigative work undertaken by the Judge in the course of his inquiry.  They said there was ample supportive evidence at the Judge’s inquiry for his conclusions about causation, and noted that his different conclusion from the Chief Inspector was based in part on new evidence before the Judge that was not available to the Chief Inspector.In particular, the Privy Council said, and I quote, “the Royal Commission Report convincingly clears Captain Collins and First Officer Cassin of any suggestion that negligence on their part had in any way contributed to the disaster. That is unchallenged.”Those findings stood then, and they stand now.  The pilots were not responsible for this tragedy, and I stand here today to state that again. But these were not findings accepted by the Government of the day. The Government did not table the report in Parliament. Nearly 20 years went by before the report was finally tabled in 1999. That was wrong. It caused trauma on top of grief. And persecution on top of pain.I want to acknowledge, as many in Parliament did when the inquiry was finally tabled, that the way Justice Mahon’s report was handled was wrong.That mishandling was one very difficult feature of the long hard road you have travelled – in the years leading up to the tabling of the report in 1999, and through the years following.  In an environment of tumultuous claim and counter claim, of public confusion and ongoing debate, it is difficult I am sure to find a clear place to set down your grief.After 40 long years, you deserve to find that place. No one can assume to know what that requires though, or even if it’s possible. I have read many accounts from family members – letters telling stories of that day, of the weeks that followed, of the trauma that arises any time that Erebus is mentioned. All I know is that after 40 years, setting down grief will only be made harder, if we don’t acknowledge past wrongs.If we accept the Royal Commission’s findings on the cause of the accident, which are well established, then the time has come to end the piecemeal acknowledgements.After forty years, on behalf of today’s government, the time has come to apologise for the actions of an airline then in full state ownership; which ultimately caused the loss of the aircraft and the loss of those you loved.  This apology is whole hearted and wide reaching.  We will never know your grief, but I know the time has come to say I am sorry.In making this apology I speak also for and with Air New Zealand. I know that for many, grievances still exist with the airline.  I do not comment on some of the more famous phrases of the Royal Commission of Inquiry except to note what I believe is the change in the Air New Zealand of the 21st century, a company that in form, structure and approach is very different to the Air New Zealand of 1979.  I acknowledge the efforts the airline has itself made over recent years to address your grief, including bringing people from throughout New Zealand, and from overseas, to this gathering today.I would now like to invite Air New Zealand Chairman Dame Therese Walsh to speak. Dame Therese Walsh:Thank you Prime Minister.While words will never bring back those lost on Mt Erebus this day forty years ago, I would like to express regret on behalf of Air New Zealand for the accident that took the lives of 257 passengers and crew.I apologise on behalf of an airline which 40 years ago failed in its duty of care to its passengers and staff.And I apologise again on behalf of the airline for the way in which the families of those lost on Mt Erebus were treated in the aftermath of the accident.  Better care should have been taken of you.As the Prime Minister has touched on the Air New Zealand of today is a different airline, one which has learned many lessons from the Erebus tragedy and strives harder than ever to ensure that safety in all of our operations is paramount and non-negotiable.On a high mountain, those who were loved were lost.  Our memories of those who were lost can guide us. Prime Minister Ardern:Thank you Dame Therese.Some may say that the past is the past, that we cannot change what happened. That fails to consider that our future is shaped by where we have come from. It is shaped by our response to tragedy and injustice, and by the people who stand up against it.The past is never just the past.As we mark the 40th anniversary of an event that remains etched in New Zealand’s psyche, we reflect on all that was lost, all that we must learn, and a future that we all must keep striving to make better.No reira tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa."

Warm Pacific greetings to you all.I am really pleased I could be here with you today - to share this time with so many great innovators, thinkers and policymakers. Thank you for making the time to be here and for answering the call to come and share your expertise with us. I am looking forward to meeting and chatting with some of you later and hearing about the outstanding work you do. Over the next two days the work you do will help shape the future of my Ministry. You will help take us another step closer to making the vision we set for Pacific Aotearoa a reality. This government has laid the foundations with its Pacific vision and put a cornerstone in place with the Budget earlier this year, but what we build together from here you can help decide. Indeed, the expertise you will share with us over the next two days will help us put more of the frameworks in place that will shape the future of languages and Pacific entrepreneurism. So, here’s my challenge to you. Over the next two days I want you to work towards agreeing a short statement outlining where we should go next. I want you to capture the conversations you have and the ideas you generate, so that after today every discussion I have with my Ministerial colleagues about the direction we head, your ideas will be there with me. I will ask that my team send me a copy of what you come up with, so that it can also inform our thinking about the creation of the Pacific languages’ unit and options for a Pacific science, technology and innovation strategy. One of the reasons I want to set you this challenge is to focus our attention on the fact that we are here to make change happen. To turn a vision into reality. To develop ideas. To share expertise. And, importantly, we are here to do it together – a partnership between my Ministry team and you, our experts, innovators, and thought leaders. A partnership that - if we get it right - can endure for years to come. And we need it to endure. Because our Pacific future is already here, and we need to fully realise its potential. Just consider this for a moment: the median age of Pacific people living in Aotearoa right now is 22 years. Half of all Pacific people living in New Zealand right now are 22 years of age or younger. Isn’t that extraordinary? Particularly when you consider that the median age for New Zealanders descended from Europe is 42 years – an entire generation older. This begs the obvious question we need to ask ourselves – where, then, will growth in the future come from? Well, it will it will come from Pacific people. More and more of the business, political and community decisions that will shape our lives in future will come from Pacific people, from Pacific thinkers, from Pacific activists, from Pacific innovators. As a government we want to make it possible for every person, no matter where they come from, to fulfil their purpose and be the best they can be. We know there is a lot we can do to make this happen – and we are taking this action. From building a more accessible education system; to ensuring people have warm, safe homes; or mitigating the harmful effects of child poverty… Everything we do will, in some way, effect how prosperous our workplaces and communities are in the future. But we cannot do it alone. You also have a role to play. After all, the story of Aotearoa New Zealand isn’t written by people in power, but by the people we support and learn from. People like you. What that means, then, is that we need to work together - government, business, community and the working population. Why that’s relevant to us here today is because it is by working in partnership that we can think about the ways we develop and organise our high-growth sectors, like technology, so opportunities and prosperity can be shared fairly, both economically and socially.Making this happen is what lay at the heart of our wellbeing agenda – ensuring every person can lead fulfilling, meaningful and prosperous lives. We can apply that to the work we are here to do today and tomorrow by thinking about what changes need to be made to open high-tech sectors to a broader portion of the population. Currently only 2 percent of the technology sector identify as Pacific. Clearly what we need then is to get a better distribution and accessibility of quality jobs and incomes. Achieving this means encouraging more Pacific people into science, technology and innovation throughout their schooling and working lives – and we are doing that. But we also need to ensure that when Pacific people – and, indeed, non-Pacific people - go on to create cutting-edge technology they do so whilst creating quality jobs for those less skilled than themselves. Otherwise we risk there being a high skilled elite at the top, and low-quality work in the middle and at the bottom. High-tech sectors need to be ordered so good quality careers are available to people that do not necessarily have technological expertise. There need to be good jobs at every level of the system. This will create a more open and inclusive sector where more people can succeed.  One of the reasons this is so important for us is because Pacific people, wherever and however they are employed, bring a unique perspective to their work – diverse ethnicities, cultures and languages that can help to shape and reshape the way we do things now and long into the future.For me this is the space in which our two topics of discussion - language and innovation – interact. Because when we have our own language, we are much more confident in our cultures. And when we have that, we can tell our own stories and, critically, we can think about the future through our own lens. It is these unique Pacific perspectives that can help create space for us to devise new, innovative solutions to the challenges we face.  We all know that technology is changing not just how we do business, or how we buy products. It is reshaping how we interact, how we form and maintain relationships, and how we address some of the most pressing challenges we face. Throughout history governments have been a critical part of the story of how innovation happens. The history of technological advance is full of examples where the public sector has taken most of the risks in the innovation process, but with little of the reward. Indeed, it was public money that paid for the research behind the internet, GPS, and the Web. What these examples teach us is that we will need brave, highly skilled, visionary people – both in government and out – who are willing to explore ideas, create innovations and make discoveries. Pacific people know the importance of this this better than anyone – for our entire history is founded on the spirit of discovery. We need to draw from this past to reimagine our future. A core foundation for this future is our wellbeing agenda, which for Pacific peoples is built on four parts: Supporting Pacific businesses to grow, as well as creating opportunities across the economy for more Pacific people to enjoy meaningful, well-paid work;Making sure we are training and supporting more young Pacific people with the skills they need to get these good jobs;Providing better access to affordable homes and healthcare;And connecting more Pacific people to their language, culture and identity. Our Budget this year provided a roadmap to deliver this agenda – a roadmap that will guide us all towards a confident, more resilient and more prosperous Pacific community. It was a first step on our journey of turning our Pacific vision into something real.We at MPP can do our bit, but our vision also requires a step change in how government makes decisions that affect Pacific people. That’s why my officials are working at the most senior levels of government and bringing together representatives from other Ministries to ensure our Pacific vision, Lalanga Fou, is the guide not only for what we do, but for decisions they are making too.  Every Pacific policy. Every Pacific initiative should help advance at least one of the four goals the community articulated in Lalanga Fou. We are clear about that and that’s what we’re working towards One of the areas we can have a profound impact is in language and culture. I have already touched on how viewing the world through a Pacific lens can bring benefits to us all. But to see clearly through that lens we need an understanding of what it is and how language shapes what we see through it. In other words, an understanding of how language shapes our world view.Right now, our Pacific languages are clinging to existence with great fragility - and they are diminishing by the generation. Our job – the job of those of us here - is to change that. For me, this is one of the defining challenges faced by Pacific communities across Aotearoa New Zealand right now. I know there will always be those who say it's too difficult; that it’s not useful the economy; or that young generations simply do not want to learn. But they are wrong. Our identity, our sense of belonging, our wellbeing is tied to the ability of our people to express themselves in their own language. Here, in New Zealand, our lives are shaped primarily by the English language – but with our own Pacific languages, we can do more to ensure our cultures are better reflected in the way society presents itself and talks about who it is.  For languages are how we share our culture - its history, its present and its future. If our languages are not spoken, then the journey our cultures are taking change too – and the opportunities available for others to understand and learn from our culture diminishes with it. That applies to the technology sector as much as it does to anywhere else. As societies inevitably change, we need our languages so that we can restore and reinvent our cultures and traditions in ways that are sustainable and ensure they survive in the face of this change and modernisation. To put it another way, if we do not act, words that future generations of Pacific New Zealanders use to understand where they come from and how they see the world will not be their own.  And they will not be the only ones to lose out. We all will. That's why our decision in the Budget to allocate $20 million to a new dedicated languages unit in the Ministry for Pacific Peoples is so important.This new unit will be tasked with working with experts like you and the community to figure out how we best deliver our vision of a New Zealand where all Pacific people can learn and use their language - at home, at work, and in our communities. Our objective in this isn’t simply to increase the number of Pacific language speakers, but to help our people develop a stronger identity as Pacific New Zealanders. Because when we have our language, we have our story. And when we have our story, we have a sense of place. And when we have a sense of place, we have the confidence we need to thrive. Importantly, languages do not just tell us something about who we are – they tell us where we are too. Many of us, I’m sure, will have stories about why learning English was a matter of survival for our families when making their home here. Interacting with people, getting a job, filling in forms, opening a bank account – so much of what we must do simply to get by demands that we speak English. English has been internalised as our norm. Unfortunately, this has diminished the opportunities we have to give proper value to Pacific languages outside the home, family, and church. We can change that - and today I am delighted to announce the launch of a Languages Innovation Fund to support grassroots work that helps revive, grow and celebrate our Pacific languages. We will first pilot the Fund, which will provide us with the opportunity to test some ideas, approaches, criteria and processes that will help inform and shape how we support innovative community initiatives moving forward. As I speak, we are publishing a webpage where you can find out more about the fund and apply for support. What this fund is about, is about giving Pacific people greater freedom to shape the future of their own culture and language. Technology is going to be a key part of its. Our ancestors navigated by the stars for months to reach the Pacific islands we now call home. Of course, now we have a virtual reach that means we can connect with these very same places in seconds. This change has undoubtedly created opportunities that would have been hard to imagine even a generation ago. But there is another important aspect to this that we need to discuss – and that is the interaction between technological change and the world of work, and in particular, what this may mean for young people.  Technological change isn’t anything new, of course. Human history has always been shaped by rapid change. Innovations that disrupt the current generation, often seem entirely normal to the next. Perhaps what is different now - compared to other times in history - is the pace of change we are experiencing. We need to be ready, then, so that an increasingly digitalised and automated world brings greater security and wellbeing for all of us. Whilst each of us now has a means of communication, connection and influence that outstrips anything we have seen before, these advances have taken place in a system that is also more challenging. It is harder now for a young person to plan a long-term career with any confidence. Work is increasingly precarious; there are more zero-hours or short-term contracts; more self-employed people with erratic incomes. And for those with stable work, there are many who will feel pressured to dedicate more and more time to their jobs. This can take them away from everything that makes them who they are – from raising their families to enjoying the simple pleasures of leisure time.  We need to be honest about the fact that some of this detrimental change that many people may feel at the individual and family level is a by-product of technological advance. What we can do though is ensure that technological change does not outstrip the speed with which we are willing to change policies and laws to safeguard the values we hold dear. Because the work you and future generations pursue will not just be a means to earn money, and provide for your families, important though that it is. It will also be a source of identity and purpose in our lives. We need to make it count for something. In other words, what we do here today and the ideas we have for creating new opportunities are crucial to our collective sense wellbeing. So, as you start to think about what you will contribute over the next two days, know that you have the power to reshape society – whether through new innovations or language or both. You know, one of my favourite things to do in this job is to meet with experts like you - to hear from them directly. The reason is simple: because these conversations often generate new ideas; they inspire me, they help remind me of what it means to be a Pacific leader today – what the challenges are, what the hopes and aspirations are. But, more than this, I always come away with a sense of hope. Today is no exception. For there is so much we are yet to accomplish, and you are the ones making it happen. I look forward to hearing from our speakers and panels about the work we can do together.Ends. "

Ara tai uru, whai uru, whai uru! Ara whai ato, whai ato, whai ato! Ara rā tini, ara rā tini, ara ri!The rays of the morning sun strike a new dawn upon Pukaha Mt Bruce! Rise up the inland, follow it through, fence it in, surround it, arise the many, the innumerable, arise indeed!E Te Whare o Pāremata - Tena koe E nga Tangata whenua o Te Ati Awa, o Taranaki Whanui Tena koutouIt is my pleasure to be hosting the Minister of Defence Awards of Excellence for Industry and Employer Support at Parliament for the very first time. Convening the awards in this venue is in recognition of Defence industry as a key partner and fundamental enabler of New Zealand Defence.  Tonight we also recognise organisations from across New Zealand and overseas that provide goods and services to Defence, employ defence people, and who support the Defence Force by generously allowing their staff to meaningfully contribute to our national resilience and community well-being as members of the Reserve and Cadet Forces, and support the Limited Service Volunteer scheme. Many of you here tonight who provide that support have travelled long distances to be here. Some have come as far as Norway – thank you.I would like to begin by acknowledging Bevan Killick, the Chair of the Defence Employer Support Council, and Greg Lowe, the Chair of the Defence Industry Advisory Council for co-hosting this awards dinner with me.I also want to acknowledge Your Worships the Mayors of Palmerston North City, Rangitikei, Taraua, and Wellington, Grant Smith, Andy Watson, Tracey Collis, and Andy Foster; Secretary of Defence, Andrew Bridgman; Chief of Defence Force, Air Marshal Kevin Short; the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the United States Navy International Programmes, Rear Admiral Frank Morley; Service Chiefs and Deputy Secretaries; representatives of industry; Defence personnel and officials; distinguished guests.This is an important event.In a nation, region and world confronting many security challenges, New Zealand Defence is not only leading our response in meeting many of those challenges, but it also reflects the spirit of how New Zealanders would want that done.  24 hours a day, 365 days a year, our Defence Force is working to keep New Zealanders and their interests safe and secure.It is for this reason that public trust and confidence in our Armed Forces and those who support them, including Defence industry, is high.The opportunity, therefore, to recognise industry excellence in not only supporting our Servicemen and women, but also our communities is important and worth celebrating. A priority for this Government is to ensure our Defence Force personnel have the capabilities they need to do the jobs expected of them, often in very demanding environments.  Launched in June, the 2019 Defence Capability Plan set out the Coalition Government’s vision for the future Defence Force.The Plan was the outcome of a comprehensive review of the Defence procurement programme and the policies underpinning it.That review was signalled in the Coalition Agreement signed in October 2017.The end result is a government commitment to renew all of the Defence Force’s major capabilities, as well as regenerate the Defence Estate.While the Defence Capability Plan maintains the envelope of $20 billion in new investment out to 2030, it gives that investment a much sharper and human focus. It recognises the vital role the Defence Force plays in promoting the overall well-being and resilience of New Zealand, its communities and the environment.As the only agency of Government with large numbers of disciplined and skilled personnel available at short notice and that operates large fleets of vehicles, ships and aircraft, the New Zealand Defence Force is a national asset that delivers value to the Community, Nation and World.But the environment in which that value is earned is complex and changing. As a nation, we face compounding challenges as tensions in the Asia Pacific region grow and the international-rules based order that has underpinned our prosperity is under pressure.We face a number of complex disruptors, including climate change, which will test State resilience, both at home and in the South Pacific – two areas where New Zealand Defence Force leadership is non-discretionary. As Minister of Defence, I am very proud that our planning for the future Defence Force placed climate change at the forefront of the challenges facing our nation and region, and that our investment intentions reflect this.I am equally proud that my most recent statements underpinning this Government’s investment in Defence have focused on advancing Pacific partnerships and responding to climate change.These policy statements reflect a lift in our strategic ambition for the region putting the Defence Force’s ability to operate in the South Pacific on par with New Zealand’s territory, the Southern Ocean, and Antarctica. Harnessing the collective skills and energy of our people – Regular Force, Reserve Force, civilians, and industry – starts from having a robust plan and a track record of delivery. Tonight, I am very proud to say that our track record on implementing the 2019 Defence Capability Plan has included some of the biggest decisions in over 35 years.  Since coming to Office, the Government has approved contracts with industry worth over $3 billion in new military capability and infrastructure.The decision to acquire the P-8 Poseidon aircraft demonstrates this Government’s commitment to a combat capable Defence Force that is flexible and can support security for New Zealand and the South Pacific, whilst also contributing to efforts to reinforce the international rules based order. Investment in infrastructure to support the P-8 capability will inject over $300 million into the Manawatu and Rangitikei regions, while the through-life dividend could be four times that.That investment commences on Friday with the turning of soil to start the infrastructure build at Ohakea for the P-8 capability.The Government has also announced the C-130J Super Hercules as the preferred option for the replacement of our aging C-130 Hercules aircraft.Other highlights in delivering on our ambitions for the future Defence Force include the purchase and delivery of a new dive and hydrographic vessel, HMNZS Manawanui, the naming and commencement of sea trials for HMNZS Aotearoa, the build of an NH90 Flight Training Simulator and, as part of the Network Enabled Army programme, the further rollout of a modern communications and combat management system for our soldiers.We have also started early industry engagement on the Southern Ocean Patrol Vessel.In light of the Government’s commitment to implementing the Defence Capability Plan, business confidence in the sector should be high.For every dollar spent on new capability, three to four dollars are spent supporting it through life.Currently over 2,000 suppliers are engaged in supporting our air, land and maritime capabilities.These suppliers range in size from one to over 500 staff. They are based not only in the major centres, but also in regional hubs in Whangarei, Hamilton, Palmerston North, Blenheim and Nelson.In Whangarei, McKay Electrical has a workforce of over 300 people providing electrical services to the marine and naval sectors.  In Palmerston North, Noske Kaeser employs 25 locals in building and supporting marine and transport heating and ventilation systems.And in Hamilton, two very different companies, Tidd Ross Todd and Loop Technologies between them employ over 300 people in manufacturing transport systems and repairing and re-engineering electrical systems.Many suppliers to the Defence Force are also exporting their products and services into Australia and further afield.I am told that the Defence sector generates $125 million in wages, and $60 million in profits.I suspect these numbers are much higher. I am also confident that on the back of the Government’s investment in Defence these figures will grow.There is a great story here of industry working in partnership with Defence to deliver value to the Community, Nation, and World.We need to get better at telling that story.It is important, therefore, that tonight we recognise those suppliers who have demonstrated excellence in supporting the Ministry of Defence and the New Zealand Defence Force, as well as their communities.Tonight’s finalists and winners demonstrate that this support can come in a number of forms.Your common factor, however, is that most of you here tonight work for organisations based, or with a base, in New Zealand employing New Zealanders and supporting a local supply chain. Many of you are at the forefront of technological innovation, both at home and overseas.Many of you not only supply goods and services to the Ministry of Defence and the New Zealand Defence Force, but you actively encourage and support your staff as members of the New Zealand Defence Force Reserves and New Zealand Cadet Force. Without that support our Reserves could not train and our Cadet Forces would cease to operate. So employers, thank you for the sacrifices you make to allow your reservists and volunteers support the New Zealand Defence Force. Tonight, we also recognise those companies which work with the Defence Force’s Youth Development Unit and the Ministry of Social Development in helping our young people turn their lives around through the Limited Service Volunteer programme.Also known as LSV.Over 16,000 trainees have gone through the LSV programme.Having recently opened new, purpose built youth development facilities at Whenuapai Air Base and Trentham these numbers are about to grow, delivering on a Coalition promise. Many of you here tonight will be aware of my passion and belief in the value of the LSV programme.As a young man, I certainly benefited from the opportunity to serve in the New Zealand Defence Force. The pride and leadership I see in our young servicemen and women today points to this being a common experience.  Instilling this same sense of purpose and motivation into our LSV trainees is delivering positive outcomes, not only for the trainees, but also their families and their communities. A recent review of the LSV programme by the Ministry of Defence concluded that in the short-term the Programme was providing a significant uplift in individual outlook, but we need the support of industry as employers, and of industry leaders as patrons, to deliver positive long-term outcomes.Having been both an employer of LSV graduates and a patron, I encourage all of you here tonight to consider how you might partner with the Defence Force in delivering better outcomes for our youth and their communities.Tonight we will recognise one employer who has responded to this challenge and who is delivering long-term positive outcomes for our LSV graduates and their families. In closing, this is a very exciting time for all of us involved Defence, and in delivering the right military capability for New Zealand and our region. The investment decisions already taken by this Government are evidence of our commitment to ensuring that New Zealand has the Defence Force it needs to deliver value to the Community, Nation, and World.Further decisions to come on the Future Air Mobility Capability, the Enhanced Maritime Awareness Capability, and a Protected Mobility Capability, and many smaller decisions will continue this momentum.At the heart of delivering these capabilities are the people of the Ministry of Defence and the New Zealand Defence Force, supported by industry and employers, big and small. Against this back drop, I am confident that the high ambition set out in the 2019 Defence Capability Plan is achievable and that the pay-off will be great for both the New Zealand Defence Force, industry, and the communities they support.I congratulate the finalists and winners of tonight’s awards.Through your excellence and service you have earned the respect of those who put you forward for an award."

Warm Pacific greetings to you all.A great pleasure to be here at Orakei Marae with you all to welcome you to the third Pacific Parliamentary Forum.Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to be here with us in New Zealand.Why do we hold a Pacific Parliamentary Forum? Because we know that parliamentarians are absolutely central to the effective governance of a nation’s affairs. This is the case here in New Zealand just as much as it is in other countries and territories in the Pacific.Parliaments play a number of essential functions in a democratic system, from passing and scrutinising legislation, enabling governments to make effective decisions and holding governments to account, and representing the views and interests of all people in our nations.While there are rules and procedures in place in every nation to ensure the integrity of parliamentary systems, to a significant extent, parliaments are only as effective as the parliamentarians within them. Parliamentarians that can make difficult decisions based on quality evidence, that can ask the right questions to hold governments to account, that can engage credibly with communities, businesses, public servants, and the media – are parliamentarians who will improve a nation’s systems of governance.This is why we wish to build a regional community of parliamentarians, so that we can share ideas, learn from each other, and create a positive and supportive kind of ‘peer pressure’ to be the best that we can be for the people we serve.As always in our Pacific whānau, we are stronger together – so we see great value in creating relationships, partnerships, and understanding amongst parliamentarians across the region. These are ultimately the reasons why we hold a Pacific Parliamentary Forum and why we consider it to be such a valuable experience.The organising team for this event – officials from the Office of the Clerk at the New Zealand Parliament and from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have put together a pretty full programme for you this week, covering a range of topics that we think will be relevant and useful.However, in the end, this is your event. We want you to make the most out of it. So please tell the organising team if there are things you think could be more effective or ways we could alter the programme.Nevertheless there are a couple of key themes that we think could make for interesting and topical discussion.One of those is reflecting on what ‘diversity’ means in the context of strengthening parliaments as cornerstones of a democratic society. Diversity has a multitude of meanings in this context, diversity of people, diversity of thought, diversity of parliamentarians themselves, and diversity of views and perspective from people that parliamentarians represent.We want to create the space and the environment to explore deeply how diversity in all its forms and meanings affects the different functions of parliaments. How does diversity enable governments to make effective policy decisions? How does it enable parliamentarians to hold the executive to account? How does a diversity of views held with scrutiny through select committees, for example? How does it enrich parliamentary debates such that all perspectives on issues of national importance can be represented?I’m delighted that the Deputy Prime Minister of Samoa, Afioga Hon Fiame Naomi Mataafa, will be joining us in Wellington later this week to lead the workshop and the debate that will explore these important issues in greater depth.The other key theme that we would like to focus on this week is how we can work together as parliamentarians to hear the collective Pacific voice be amplified on the global stage.Working through international and multilateral forums is absolutely essential for us, as a Pacific region, to maximise our people’s well-being, to increase our opportunities for prosperity, to enforce our national and regional security, and to shape global issues in a way that we think will be beneficial for future generations.This week is a chance for us to reflect on how we as parliamentarians can play a role in this. How do we support the executive, or equally hold them to account, in ensuring that our nations are being as effective as we possibly can on the international stage? How do we ensure that shared issues of importance across the Pacific region are agreed and prioritised before they are taken onto the global stage? Which tactics and approaches have worked well, either for the Pacific or for other regions, and how can we learn from those to continually strengthen our effectiveness in achieving outcomes on the global stage that really matter to us as a region?I’m also delighted that Rhea Moss-Christian, an expert in projecting the Pacific voice on the international stage, will be joining us in Wellington to facilitate our discussions and debate on this critical issue.Of course, we are also keen to share a New Zealand perspective on these issues and others that may come up this week.Perhaps more importantly though, we want to learn from you about how New Zealand can be supporting your efforts to fulfil your nations’ ambitions.In this sense, the five “Pacific Reset” principles underlying the New Zealand Government’s engagement with the Pacific region are worth reflecting on briefly.First, we wish to demonstrate a depth of understanding. Opportunities to meet together, like this Forum, help us to understand each other’s needs and how we can work together to make a difference.Second, to exhibit friendship. We are old friends; but as you know, while the bonds between old friends will always remain strong, we sometimes need to re-invest in those relationships to keep them fresh and long-lasting. Friends usually agree on most things. However, great friends can have frank, honest, and open conversations with one another at any time. It is not always about agreeing on everything; it is about being close enough that we will remain united despite times where we may have disagreements.Third, to strive for solutions of mutual benefit. Our shared Pacific destiny means that strong Pacific Island nations make for a stronger New Zealand. We are not just charitable donors, we are your partners in development. We want to be able to make domestic policy decisions here in New Zealand that have a mutual benefit for our Pacific whānau when that is relevant – for example whether on pension portability, criminal deportations, climate change, labour mobility, and health and education policy.Fourth, to achieve collective ambition. Talking together is important, allowing that space to understand what we are trying to achieve together, and recognising that by working together on shared issues of importance we are more likely to achieve results.And finally, to seek sustainability. Focusing on the region’s long-term goals. Not just for now, but for our grandchildren, and their grandchildren and all those who follow after. As parliamentarians, along with our privileges comes the responsibility to be guardians of our nations’ futures.New Zealand recognises the complex challenges that face young people, women, children, and other marginalised groups across the Pacific region. We know that addressing these challenges is critical to sustainable development and ensuring a stable, prosperous, and resilient Pacific.In addressing these challenges, it is imperative that we listen to the voice and priorities of Pacific countries and that our actions are informed by regionally endorsed statements such as the Pacific Leaders Gender Equality Declaration 2012 and the Pacific Youth Development Framework. These documents have been instrumental in guiding what New Zealand does in our aid programme, and what we aspire to do in the future.We recognise that strengthening marginalised voices is vital as the region addresses critical challenges such as climate change.Here in New Zealand we recently passed the Zero Carbon Amendment Bill ensuring that New Zealand is playing its part in reducing emissions. And at least half of New Zealand’s 300 million dollar global climate finance commitment has been ring-fenced to support our Pacific neighbours’ resilience and response to climate change.New Zealand’s initial priorities in this space are focused around increasing the economic empowerment of women and youth, ensuring access to services and safety for all, and enhancing leadership and decision-making at all levels. Addressing violence against women and children also forms a critical part of our engagement.This has included increasing our investment in targeted development initiatives and enhancing our relationships with key partners, such as the Pacific Community, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, and the Pacific Disability Forum.The New Zealand Government has committed to increased activity in these areas. We will continue to work alongside our Pacific partners to build a region where all people are empowered, valued, and able to realise their full potential.As the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters said in a recent speech to the New Zealand Institute of International Affairs, while we are proud of many of the achievements that have been made in embedding the five “Pacific Reset” principles in New Zealand’s relationships with the Pacific region, “there is much more to be done, and we must also look ahead”.I certainly see a bright future ahead for the Pacific region. I see opportunity, solidarity, and well-being. But it will take the efforts of each and every parliamentarian in the region – as well as numerous other players – to ensure that we govern our nations in a way that our people, now and into the future, deserve to see.I hope that you will go back to your home countries at the end of this week feeling invigorated, inspired, and most importantly, knowing that you have a community of peers alongside you to share your future journey with.Ends.

2019-11-21T02:41:45Z,                                                                                                                    Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern                    ,  PM speech notes for Trans-Tasman Business Circle,"Nau mai, haere mai. Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tatou katoa. Thank you for having me to speak today.To start, I’d like to acknowledge Sharron Lloyd, the General Manager of the Trans–Tasman Business Circle, the partners for this event Westpac’s  David McLean, and Derek McCormack from  AUT, and, of course the  Circle’s founding chairperson Sir Jim McLay. The topic I have been given for today - ‘The Future of Work and how the government is preparing for the economic challenges of the future’ – may not be punchy, but it is relevant. Countries the world over are currently grappling with digital transformation, and transitioning their economies, and New Zealand is no different in that regard. Where we are different, I believe, is in the way we are responding to those challenges, turning many of them into opportunities. But first, let me start with some context for our one way conversation.Firstly, the NZ economy is in good heart amid the global challenges and what many believe are new economic normals,Secondly, the Government and Reserve Bank are doing their bit to ensure that fitness endures and it’s important business continues to work with us too – after all, we mustn’t talk ourselves into a funk, and finally,The trade environment may be challenging, but there are some positive developments so I’d like to share a few insights on that front. But first, let’s start with the here and now.It’s the economyAll of you in this room will know that this Government’s approach to the economy is that it is not an end it itself but, rather, a means to an end. Our aspiration is that we see the benefits of a strong, diverse economy more evenly shared to lift the wellbeing and living standards of all New Zealanders and their families.That of course means building strong economic foundations. And on that front we’re doing pretty damn well actually, especially amid global uncertainty. And while we know we’re not immune to the global situation, the strong surplus and our low debt levels give us the opportunity for further investments to strengthen the economy. But I would never expect you to take my word for it, so let me run through a few proof points:So far our policies have delivered growth of 0.5 percent in the June quarter and average growth of 2.4 percent in the year ending June. That shows that the New Zealand economy continues to outperform those of Australia, Canada, the Euro area, the UK, and the OECD average – basically those we compare ourselves to.Also, recent data shows New Zealand’s manufacturing and services sectors are both expanding.We have record low unemployment and annual wage growth is at its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. Average wages have increased by 4.2% in the last year alone.New Zealand continues to be a good place to do business, topping the World Bank’s 2019 Ease of Doing Business index. Our globally competitive economy is underpinned with stable political and regulatory systems, an innovative well-educated population and our proximity to 60 percent of the world’s population. We are a safe place to invest.And you’ll note that when the Reserve Bank announced its decision to hold the Official Cash Rate at 1 percent last week, its analysis confirmed the economy is in good shape, amid global economic headwinds. The Bank pointed out that employment is pretty much at its maximum sustainable level, residential investment is increasing and that economic growth is expected to rise next year, due to the Government’s investments. While the RBNZ noted that global headwinds have impacted business confidence in New Zealand, it also said that our investments are forecast to support and grow the economy next year.Ultimately, we have a positive story to tell, including to investors, and one of my consistent messages is that we are a stable, reliable  investment option, with plenty of success stories. Now, domestically, we  all need to act like it.That said, I really do acknowledge the current difficult global context many New Zealand firms are operating in and the challenges that presents for you. As a small, open economy we are not immune to the effects of the uncertain global economic environment. They are real and they are here.And, as you will know, there is a risk that international headwinds could get stronger. The US trade war with China continues without any resolution in sight. Brexit is still a key uncertainty for the global trade system, with its final form yet to be concluded. Recent data out of both Europe and the US points to declines in manufacturing. I can assure you all that the Government is keeping a very close eye on developments.However, for the reasons I have outlined, I am confident that the fundamentals of our economy are solid and that we are well placed to manage any ongoing risks. That doesn’t mean we should sit back and just wait for things to improve.Govt doing its bit In fact, I recall really distinctly Christine Lagarde as head of the IMF last year, giving APEC leaders very clear advice that it’s at this moment in time that as leaders we should be building greater resilience into our economies, and addressing long-term challenges. So let me now run through some of the work we are doing on that front.It won’t surprise you to hear me say – infrastructure, infrastructure and infrastructure. There’s no question that we have a range of deep policy issues to address as a nation, but unless we get the basics right of providing decent housing, transport and health and education services, we’ll only compound those more complex issues. That’s why the Government’s Economic Plan, which you will have heard many Ministers talk about, is designed to build an economy that protects and improves the living standards and wellbeing of all New Zealanders through ensuring we get those most basic fundamentals right.That’s why we are investing record amounts in hospital and school building programmes – including the fact that in our first two Budgets we’ve invested $2.45b into upgrading and building new hospital and health facilities- that’s twice as much as the previous government managed in nine Budgets - alongside large investments in transport safety, regional roads, and public transport, and we’ve done that while maintaining a responsible budget surplus. Not to mention our comprehensive plan to fix the housing crisis which includes delivery of: more state houses than any Government since the 1970s, banning offshore speculators, expanding Housing First to end homelessness, a $400 million package for a progressive home ownership scheme, and making saving for a house deposit easier by lowering the deposit required for a Government-backed mortgage or first home grant from 10 per cent to five per cent. These are real, tangible, things that will help New Zealanders and their families. But it is also a priority for us to ensure that we have the modern infrastructure we need to boost productivity and enable our transition to a low emissions economy.This Government has established the New Zealand Infrastructure Commission. The Commission’s role is to take a longer-term view of our infrastructure needs that improves the wellbeing of New Zealanders. This includes producing a 30-year infrastructure strategy and helping agencies pursue more innovative approaches to the development and funding of major infrastructure projects. Earlier this month, Infrastructure Minister Shane Jones welcomed the first of many updated project pipelines from the Commission. The first release of the pipeline by Treasury included a small number of capital intensive central Government agencies and had a combined worth of $6.1 billion. The latest update has an estimated value of $21.1 billion across more sectors which gives industry greater certainty to plan for upcoming projects. It means businesses will know what staffing levels they should be planning for, they will be able to better plan capital investment and they will have more information when considering potential business expansion. Ultimately, this should all be sending two really strong signals. That we are planning for the future and that now is the time to invest. New Zealand is doing well and there are enormous opportunities if we act now. The best thing for the NZ economy at the moment is optimism, planning and investment action. We’re doing some pretty heavy lifting to shore that up in terms of spending and infrastructure investment, the RBNZ is doing its bit with record low interest rates – the private sector needs to ensure it’s on board too.In fact, one of my staff members asked an economist earlier this week to sum up the economy in one sentence and was told – “it’s ready for lift-off”.  I could not agree more.The next question naturally follows: “so what is it waiting for” to which the response was “certainty”. It’s a word I hear often and here’s my simple response. There is a difference between uncertainty and change. We cannot ignore the challenges we face – the skills gap, the need for a transition to a low emissions economy, our desire to build inclusive economy where businesses compete on great products and services rather than undercutting wages and conditions. Yes this means there will be change. But the alternative is the status quo and that too would have an unacceptable impact on our economy and our people. That’s why we have laid out a clear agenda. Yes, it includes change, but by now you’ll all know what that agenda entails and how we’ll deliver it. And what I can commit to, is that while we go through change, we will consult, debate, discuss and build the consensus this country deserves.Trades trainingLet me drill into one of those specific challenges I mentioned, one of the areas of “change”. One message we as a Government hear loud and clear from you who are running and operating businesses is the difficulty you are experiencing in finding workers. And it’s a challenge that is very real.The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) forecasts demand for skilled workers, including plumbers, electricians and tilers to  increase by over 5,000 on average per year over the next three years. So to make sure there are enough skilled workers to fill those roles, we have:made the largest single increase in Trades Academy places in recent yearscommitted to a new centre of excellence for vocational education for the construction sector to drive innovationsupported the future of the industry through our landmark Construction Sector Accord and the Construction Skills Action Plancreated the $2000 Prime Minister’s Vocational Excellence Awards for the top vocational student in every secondary school in the country to lift the profile and status of the trades.One recent example of Government assistance is the announcement of additional funding to support employer-led literacy and numeracy training in the workplace. This initiative came out of the August meeting of the Tripartite Future of Work Forum – a collaboration between Government, workers and business. The new funding of $14.5 million over four years means the Government will contribute nearly $45 million to the employer-led workplace literacy and numeracy fund between 2019 and 2022. But the numbers don’t tell the story. I recently met a group of workers who were part of this programme in the Hutt. Many had English as a second language, but spoke of the difference accessing literacy and numeracy training has made in their day to day life too – one told me with huge enthusiasm that they had moved onto a digital course – he was a lawnmower by trade. Putting a bigger focus on literacy and numeracy is something employers have told us they want. The business representatives on the Forum were instrumental in helping make this happen and I thank them.But if we’re talking about making a dent in our skills gap – it is going to take a fundamental shift in the way we do things. We intend a legacy of this Government to be the shift we are making in trades training. We are making the most significant changes to trades training in a generation to make sure the workforce is in a place to face the future head on. Our Reform of Vocational Education, working alongside business, is putting in place a new system that will increase the number of people in trades training and plug nationwide skills gaps – it will give industry greater input into core aspects of vocational education and training. Industry and employers will identify skills needs, set standards and approve qualifications and credentials, and influence funding decisions – making the system more responsive to employers’ needs. But addressing the skills gap isn’t enough if we don’t, at the same time, have an eye to the future of work more generally. In this space, we’ve been careful never to try and predict what the future landscape might look like but rather to prepare ourselves for the pace of change.Future of WorkOn that front, I want to update you on the progress of the Future of Work forum which was established last year in recognition of the fact that business, workers, and the government will create better solutions for economic challenges if they work together in partnership. We’ve seen from international examples, such as in Germany and Singapore, that working together across government, businesses and workers can generate greater productivity in workplaces and allows for more effective policy making and implementation.Closer to home, the Forum has already facilitated several successful initiatives.Last year it confirmed funding to support the Skills Shift in Manufacturing Initiative, created and led by the Manufacturers Network. This will provide insight into how the mix of skills needed in manufacturing might change in the future, and provide a blueprint for how manufacturers, government and the tertiary sector can work together to prepare.It has also endorsed a “High Performance, High Engagement” approach to workplace relations in the public sector. This is based on the concept that organisations that involve workers in change processes and decisions see better productivity and more harmonious workplace relations.Today I am also able to provide you with some insight into an upcoming announcement for the Forum. On November 25 the Forum will publish its Strategic Assessment of Future of Work Priorities. This presents four initiatives as priorities:The first is Industry Transformation Plans which will ensure we add value to key sectors of our economy and leverage new opportunities. These plans – for the food and beverage, digital technology, forestry and wood processing, and construction and agritech sectors will describe an agreed vision for the future of each sector, and set out actions required to realise this vision.The second priority is facilitating in-work training. This will involve responding to the need for workers to acquire, maintain and upgrade skills throughout their working lives. The third is support for displaced workers. The future of work will mean a likely increase in numbers of workers who find that their jobs or skillsets are no longer required. We want to ensure that we make their transition between work as smooth as possible, and minimise any negative effects, such as wage scarring through a loss in earnings when they return to work.And the fourth and final priority is protections for non-standard workers. The future of work will mean a great number of workers in of non-standard employment, particular the increase in contractors or people working in the gig economy. We need to make sure that the increase in non-standard work does not mean a decrease in the protections for workers. I applaud the work to date and look forward to seeing more innovative and collaborative solutions. So much of the work we are doing on the Future of Work acknowledges that we’re increasingly living in a globalised, borderless but interdependent, world. But as a trading nation, we’ve probably understood that more than most.TradeInternationally, of course, trade continues to be a huge part of the work we are doing. My recent flying visit to Bangkok for the ASEAN meetings and the East Asia Summit – which took on a bigger trade focus with the cancellation of the APEC Leaders’ meeting in Chile - had some really positive outcomes. As you will have heard, we had two good results:an upgraded Free Trade Agreement with China that ensures that long-term we have the best FTA China has with any country and reflects the importance both countries place on the relationship and the significant mutual benefits it brings. and news that leaders of 16 countries negotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) completed negotiation on the text as well as agreement on virtually all market access issues between 15 countries. We’ll also continue to work with India to resolve its outstanding concerns in a way that would satisfy the interests of all countries. The aim remains that India will join the agreement in 2020, once it has concluded market access negotiations with all the other participants but I acknowledge that will be challenging.That’s the public detail of the trip – what I imagine you’ll be interested in is the tone and flavour of the many conversations I had. Overall, my talks highlighted the breadth of the relationships we already have and many identified new areas for cooperation – who knew sheep placenta cream was in such demand in Thailand for instance!But I’d be glossing over reality if I didn’t acknowledge the impact of the current trade war between the US and China. I suspect it’s given renewed focus for RCEP – but it also highlights to me the importance of our Trade for All agenda, and maintaining social licence to trade. It’s just not a given that all nations support free trade – and it’s up to all of us to ensure as many people as possible see the benefits of it, lest borders and bilateral arrangements become more entrenched.ConclusionIn summary, the Government has a plan to transition New Zealand through these uncertain times, to more productive, sustainable and inclusive growth the improves the wellbeing of all New Zealanders.Shifting the dial on these long-term economic challenges requires us to work together. We know that partnership with business is critical for transforming the economy, and confronting the long-term challenge of responding to the future of work. I look forward to continuing to build our partnership through the times ahead.Let me finish by repeating a simple, clear message: we have big aspirations for what we – working alongside business - can achieve with the New Zealand economy in order to lift the living standards of, and secure a strong future, for all New Zealanders and their families.I don’t back down from that, in fact I own it. We inherited a stable economy but a country that had major challenges. We are making good progress but there is more work to do. I’m up for it and I hope you are too.ENDS"
2019-11-21T00:11:41Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Nanaia Mahuta                    ,  LGNZ Rural and Provincial Sector Speech," Introduction Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today. This is the first opportunity I’ve had to speak to an LGNZ meeting since the local elections, and I’m delighted to see the fresh faces of newly elected mayors. To returning mayors here today, as well as chief executives, thank you for the commitment and dedication you’ve shown towards your communities throughout the year. As you’ll be aware, I have a busy programme of work in the local government space, and I’d also like to take the opportunity to thank you and your councils for your input into the various workstreams. That input, and our ongoing conversation, are essential and invaluable as we seek to ensure the responsiveness of local government to the wellbeing of communities now and into the future.  Today I’d like to take stock of where we’re at and where we’re going with some of my key priorities in the local government portfolio. I’ll also touch on work underway in my Associate Environment portfolio. Later today, you’ll also hear from my ministerial colleagues the Hon David Parker, Hon Damien O’Conner, and Hon Eugenie Sage about their priorities and connections to local government and the rural and provincial sectors. I trust this will provide an insightful overview of the range of cross-government initiatives relevant to local government.  But first, let me update you on a programme of key importance to local and central government – the Three Waters Review.Three Waters Review When we were elected into government back in October 2017, it was clear that a decisive response to the Havelock North Drinking Water Inquiry was needed to ensure public safety. As I’ve always said – clean, safe drinking water must be a fundamental right for all communities. And I’m very pleased that, with the assistance of local government, extensive progress has been made. In line with the recommendations of the Inquiry, and with significant contributions from local government, we have agreed to put into place: a new and strengthened drinking water regulatory regime to ensure all communities receive safe drinking water; a new drinking water regulator, as an independent Crown entity, to work with local government, iwi/Māori, and other suppliers to administer the new regulatory system; and Targeted reforms to the regulation of wastewater and stormwater, including greater central oversight and guidance to improve environmental outcomes. We are well underway in implementing these decisions. An Establishment Unit has been set up within the Department of Internal Affairs, with initial work underway to design and stand-up the new regulator. We’re aiming to have the regulator ready to go live in about 18 months.  At the same time, my officials are drafting two Bills to legislate for the new regime. We’re aiming to introduce the first bill – the ‘Water Services Regulator Bill’ – into the House by the end of the year. The second ‘Water Services Bill’, which will enact the new regulatory framework, won’t be far behind. I’d like to acknowledge the expert input and support from local government staff and elected representatives this year as we’ve developed these regulatory proposals. In particular, I acknowledge the input from mayors and chief executives from the Rural/Provincial Sector councils into the reference groups that informed the regulatory reforms. My officials commented on the quality of input they received from these reference groups, helping them to fully refine the proposals. There were other contributions, and I’d especially like to mention Mayor Rowley and the Waimate District Council who were especially supportive in making issues of rural drinking water supplies very real for me and officials. We acknowledge that it will be challenging for some councils and drinking water suppliers to comply with their regulatory obligations. This will be managed by allowing for guidance from the regulator and time to achieve compliance. As members of rural/provincial councils, you’ll be aware that there are wider funding and capability issues associated with New Zealand’s water services arrangements – especially for smaller councils and communities with limited funding bases. The Government is actively working with local government on a solution to these wider challenges. In particular, the question of how water services are funded and whether we need greater sharing of costs and revenues across communities. We want to work with the sector to support greater use of shared service delivery arrangements. To help remove financial barriers for councils considering voluntary change, we’ve already agreed to consider co-investing with local government, on a case-by-case basis, the costs of investigating collaboration on water services. I’m pleased to see that there are a number of collaborative discussions already underway, including councils in the Hawke’s Bay, Waikato, West Coast, Canterbury, Manawatu-Wanganui and others. Next month, Cabinet will consider advice on supporting the local government sector to make the step-change needed to ensure all communities benefit from safe, affordable, reliable and culturally acceptable three waters services. How to fund these critical services is at the heart of this work.Further work will progress into 2020 and beyond, and we look forward to your continued input and support. Community wellbeing Another area of vital importance and continued involvement from local government is our community wellbeing workstream. In August 2019, I wrote to you announcing a work programme that builds on the reinstatement of the four wellbeings in the purpose of the Local Government Act. We know that councils never stopped prioritising the wellbeing of their communities. But I’m interested in whether more can be achieved by focusing on some key aspects of local governance. Specific objectives to be explored as part of the ‘Working with Local Government on Community Wellbeing’ programme include:more inclusive community participation in local government;aiming for more meaningful council relationships with Māori;capturing the more specific wellbeing priorities of our local communities; andbetter collaboration across central and local government and iwi/hapū in responding to those priorities.We’ve recently convened working groups with experienced and innovative local government practitioners to explore what initiatives would help to promote a wellbeing approach in local governance.I’ve greatly appreciated the role LGNZ and SOLGM have played in helping to convene these working groups, which are yielding rich conversations about the objectives I set out in my August Cabinet Paper.   Alongside these workshops, we’ll also have conversations with Te Pae Urungi, iwi and Māori organisations.We want to arrive at options that broaden and accelerate the uptake of innovative practices. We also want to have better, more evidence-based conversations about how we are tracking.A challenge for central government is how to be prepared to come to the table as a partner invested in the outcome of this work. We also need to be prepared to be influenced in terms of how it delivers services according to the priorities identified by communities.   Next year, I look forward to holding a conversation with chairs and mayors about initiatives that central and local government could progress to ensure a richer, more collaborative and community-based wellbeing approach.Community resilience A key part of protecting the wellbeing of our communities is ensuring that we plan for the growing risks from natural hazards. Only by working together can we achieve the changes needed to respond to the very real challenges facing communities throughout New Zealand. Central and local government are working together to develop a joint Community Resilience Work Programme, to strengthen community resilience in the face of natural hazards and the effects of climate change.In addition to working at the system level, we’re also working directly with councils. This includes working with some councils to manage natural hazards at Kaikōura, Matatā and Franz Josef. This is a great example of local and central government co-designing policy in response to a challenge of intergenerational importance. At the same time, we’re developing a strategy to support iwi/Māori participation in the joint work programme, including where Māori priorities and existing initiatives align and support responses.  The programme will now look at flood management as a working example of managing and mitigating a natural hazard. This will involve progress in three priority areas: data-driven decision-making to understand and manage risk; regulatory systems to support proactive and flexible decision-making and risk management; and a framework for considering potential changes to roles, responsibilities and funding arrangements. Later next year, Cabinet will be considering a proposed framework to guide the role of central government in strengthening community resilience. This will involve consideration of how central and local government can better integrate planning and risk management approaches in the face of a changing environment. I look forward to continuing the conversation with you on this vitally important work.Inquiry into local government funding and financing As we advance this ambitious local government work programme, we are mindful of growing costs and pressures facing the sector.    That’s why, in 2018, this Government engaged the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into the costs and revenue of local government. The recommendations of this inquiry are intended to contribute towards our decision-making, so that New Zealanders can benefit from a fiscally-strong local government now and into the future. Informed by your submissions and input, we’re expecting the Productivity Commission’s final report at the end of this month. Many of you will be aware that officials are already gathering their own evidence – and talking with the local government sector and stakeholders up and down the country – to understand the challenges and opportunities around local government affordability. This will position the Government to offer an informed and constructive response to the Productivity Commission’s findings.  I expect our response will be supported by the programmes we already have underway, and which are already looking at ways to respond to and alleviate cost pressures in the sector.One of these is the work on Infrastructure Funding and Financing and enabling new Special Purpose Vehicles for the provision of growth infrastructure. I expect the results of this policy work to be announced and available in the next month. Again, this has been a real collaborative effort with the High Growth Councils so thank you.National Policy Statement for Indigenous Biodiversity I’d like to finish by updating you on a key priority for me in my Associate Environment portfolio – the development of a National Policy Statement for Indigenous Biodiversity. We need clear, strong direction at the national level to help halt the decline of biodiversity and start to restore what has been lost. We also need certainty in the system, so that councils and landowners know what needs to be protected, and how land can be developed or used.   The proposed National Policy Statement for Indigenous Biodiversity provides this vital direction. It will be an important tool for improving biodiversity management across the country, particularly on private land where many of our threatened species, habitats, and ecosystems are found. A draft of this National Policy Statement was developed by the stakeholder-led Biodiversity Collaborative Group. The Policy Statement has momentum in the form of support from the Group, and alignment with other National Direction work such as the National Policy Statement for Urban Development and the Essential Freshwater package.Based on best practice, and in line with the Collaborative Group’s recommendations, the proposed Policy Statement would require councils to consistently identify and manage Significant Natural Areas. Councils would also be required to work with tangata whenua and consider te ao Māori in biodiversity management. In addition, it would require management of other important indigenous biodiversity outside of Significant Natural Areas, including highly mobile fauna and taonga. There would also be a requirement for councils to promote restoration and enhancement. Some ecosystems in New Zealand have suffered so much loss that this is the only way they can be maintained. Pending Cabinet approval soon, public consultation on the proposed National Policy Statement will run into next year, with public meetings being held in early 2020. Officials are planning to undertake detailed testing with a small number of councils during this time. I encourage you to get involved in this testing, so that the Policy Statement can be refined, and implementation support can be developed. Conclusion To sum up, the scope of this Government’s programme of reform reflects the vital importance of local government – and the work that you all do day-to-day – to the wellbeing of New Zealanders. We are committed to a strong, robust local government sector, focused on wellbeing. To achieve this, we need an effective partnership between central and local government, and iwi/Māori, guided by the aspirations of our local communities. I thank you, once again, for the willingness with which you and your councils have, this year, extended your time and expertise towards these important programmes. I look forward to working with you over the coming term. "
2019-11-20T06:00:00Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Iain Lees-Galloway                    ,  Diversity and tolerance lead international cooperation on migration,"Thank you for inviting me to speak tonight.I firstly want to acknowledge all of you for being concerned about how we treat migrants and how we work together internationally on issues of migration.Secondly, let me acknowledge a few key people:Peter Nichols (President of UNANZ)Distinguished Professor Paul Spoonley FRSNZ (College of Humanities and Social Sciences of Massey University)Joy Dunsheath, JP, former President and current member of the World Federation of United Nations Associations.IntroductionWhile I will speak on how we cooperate internationally to manage the movement of people across borders, I want to start by addressing the values we hold and how they can guide us.I’m sure I don’t need to tell you about the mention of the global compact on migration in the March mosque attacks. Nor remind you that some responded by spreading misinformation about it suggesting we wouldn’t have sovereignty over our own borders.That was never true.Did that whip up fear and intolerance – I can’t say. But it could have fed fuel to a particular group of people who were keen on fanning the flames of fear and intolerance.So let’s start with the actual facts:The status of the Compact is explicit – paragraph 7 states that “this Global Compact presents a non-legally binding, cooperative framework”.We maintain our sovereignty, and we are not forced to do anything, but we are encouraged to work with other nations. As we should. After the March mosque attacks our Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said to the BBC “if we want to make sure that globally we are a safe and tolerant and inclusive world, we cannot think of this in terms of boundaries.”She said she completely rejected the idea that our immigration systems had contributed to the attacks in any way. We are a welcoming country.And more than that, we benefit from our communities being diverse and tolerant.  Overview of the CompactIrregular migration is a global issue that requires global solutions. Today there are over 272 million people in the world who were not born in the country they now reside in. Most of our own families, our ancestors, were not born in New Zealand of course.Is that a reason to fear us? No.That is a reason to celebrate the diverse and interesting world in which we live.New Zealand supports a State-led approach to migration that upholds the human rights and wellbeing of migrants and their families and that promotes inclusive economic growth and sustainable development.Lead up to the Compact2015 saw historic levels of displacement around the world, as the Syrian crisis added significantly to a range of others. The movement of huge numbers of people simply walking across borders in search of somewhere safe to live was challenging for humanity.On 19 September 2016 at the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, in response to the international community’s growing concerns about the challenges of migration, all 193 UN Member States adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (the New York Declaration).In this declaration the 193 nations committed to negotiate the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration: the first international and non-legally binding cooperative framework on migration.New Zealand advocated for a balanced, non-binding Compact that does not replace existing international agreements and standards, but rather sits alongside and upholds existing mechanisms such as the Sustainable Development Goals. Our goal was to strengthen international cooperation to address irregular migration, while fostering and incentivising regular migration.From February 2018 to July 2018, New Zealand officials participated in six rounds of intergovernmental negotiations. Officials engaged with the development of the Compact to seek consistency with New Zealand’s domestic policy settings, ensure it was not legally binding, and could be applied in accordance with states’ capacity and priorities. These were the mandates agreed by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Immigration under the current and previous governments.Officials also engaged in these processes to ensure that Compact was based on existing human rights law.Our officials’ assessment was that the Compact largely met these objectives. In the small number of areas where New Zealand’s domestic policy settings differ from the suggested actions of the Compact, New Zealand is able to apply the Compact in a manner consistent with its own legislation and policies.  Our Government announced on 19 December 2018 that New Zealand would support the Compact.New Zealand — along with 151 other UN Member States — subsequently voted in favour of the Global Compact at the formal adoption ceremony in New York that day. (Five countries voted against the resolution, with 12 abstaining).The Global Compact for Migration is the first United Nations agreement on a common approach to international migration. This means that, like other areas of international relations, there will be a set of common principles to guide approaches to migration.Our Government supports the Global Compact as it meets New Zealand’s overall objectives of strengthening international cooperation to dismantle human trafficking and people smuggling syndicates, as well as to reduce the social, economic and political drivers that lead to irregular migration and prevent migrant exploitation. It also encourages good practice in regular migration.As I said at the start, the Global Compact is non-legally binding and does not create any new legal obligations for countries supporting it. States are able to apply it in a manner consistent with their own priorities and capacity.  People trafficking and the Bali ProcessThe New Zealand Government is committed to combatting people trafficking domestically, regionally and internationally. The United Nations defines people trafficking as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a person by deceptive, coercive or other improper means for the purpose of exploiting that person. It is a global crime, committed at the expense of victims who are robbed of their dignity and freedom. We have a comprehensive, whole-of-government response to people trafficking called the Plan of Action to Prevent People Trafficking. The Plan’s goals are to prevent people trafficking, protect the human rights of trafficking victims, and prosecute people traffickers. The Plan of Action is currently being refreshed to reflect changes in our legislation as well as the nature of people trafficking in New Zealand. New Zealand has a strong stance on people trafficking and has comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation. Sadly, New Zealand is not untouched by people trafficking crimes. In the last 10 years, there were four people trafficking prosecutions in New Zealand involving more than 40 victims, mostly for the purposes of labour exploitation. New Zealand is engaged in multiple international fora to promote more effective and coordinated international efforts to curb people smuggling and trafficking. This includes the Bali Process, which is a forum for discussion, information sharing and practical cooperation in regard to the issues of people smuggling, trafficking in persons and related transnational crime. Within the Bali Process, New Zealand is the co-chair of the Working Group on the Disruption of Criminal Networks involved in People Smuggling and Trafficking in Persons. This working group focuses on concrete, action oriented activities for enhancing coordination to disrupt and dismantle criminal networks involved in people smuggling and trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region. We put funding into the prevention of people trafficking in the last budget, and will continue to ramp up the work we are doing to ensure we are doing all we can to stop the exploitation of vulnerable people by these criminals. On that note, we are making efforts to support the safer option those people in danger have, which is to become a refugee.  New Zealand’s refugee policiesNew Zealand has been resettling refugees on a regular basis since 1979 and the Refugee Quota Programme was introduced in 1987.The Refugee Quota Programme is a reflection of the Government’s commitment to fulfilling its international humanitarian commitments to provide protection to refugees who are not able to return safely to their home country. Consistent with the UNHCR, the Government prioritises referral of refugees for the Refugee Quota Programme based on refugees’ priority needs, which includes women and children at risk, and people with disabilities. The majority of refugees resettles in New Zealand through the Refugee Quota Programme are resettled as family groups.  On arrival in New Zealand quota refugees become permanent residents and are eligible to access government funded services the same as other residents and New Zealand citizens.  They are eligible to apply for New Zealand citizenship after five years of residence in New Zealand.As you will know, the Government has decided that the following changes will take effect from July 2020 when the annual refugee quota increases from 1,000 to 1,500:The annual number of places within the refugee quota for large-scale refugee crisis situations will be increased from July 2020 from 100 to 200 to maintain flexibility to respond to a new global refugee crisis.  The sub-category for women at risk will increase from a minimum of 75 places a year to a minimum of 150 a year. The Government has removed the family link requirement for Middle East or Africa regions. That was never our policy and it had to go.  ConclusionIn conclusion, all of this work, from global cooperation on migration, to the prevention of people trafficking and the support for refugees, we bring our humanity.We like to think we are in a modern and tolerant world. We forget quite how much work it takes to keep it that way. But what better work to do than to protect our humanity and build a global culture where everyone is valued. I’d like to finish on another comment from our Prime Minister:“Every choice someone makes to learn about another culture, to experience the simple act of trying out a different food, seeing a different form of dance, hearing a different language, that is a choice, to open yourselves up to another culture, ethnicity and to diversity.”The benefits of being tolerant and inclusive are enormous, both culturally and economically, so we need to continue to make the right choices, and continue to contribute to a modern New Zealand that is inclusive and tolerant and welcoming.That’s a New Zealand we can all be proud of. "
2019-11-17T23:30:39Z,                                                                                                                    Hon Carmel Sepuloni                    ,  Speech to the Child Poverty Action Group 2019 Summit," Fa’atalofa atu, malo e lelei, Kia ora koutou katoaThank you to the Child Poverty Action Group for asking me to be here today to provide an update on some of the things that have been happening across my the social development portfolio.  Can I firstly acknowledge the vast experience and knowledge of your guest speakers today- many of whom were members of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. It’s great to see you all. It was just over two years ago that, with our Confidence and Supply Agreement partner the Green Party of Aotearoa, our Government set ourselves the task to ‘overhaul the welfare system’I want to acknowledge the Green Party for this. Ensuring that this was a key part of our Confidence and Supply Agreement meant that we would collectively share the responsibility to deliver towards this lofty goal- because it does take all of us. I also want to acknowledge that across Government, including New Zealand First, we have broad support for the need for change within our welfare system. As a government, we have a vision for a welfare system that ensures people have an adequate income and standard of living, are treated with respect, can live in dignity and are able to participate meaningfully in their communities.We are committed to upskilling and training people on benefit so they can access sustainable work and we want everyone that is able, to be earning, learning, caring or volunteering. We want a welfare system that is fairer and more accessible for all New Zealanders and we want New Zealand to be the best place in the world to be a child. That’s why we invested in the Families Package in our first 100 days.The Families Packaged included the Best Start payment for families with new babies; We introduced the winter  energy payment; We made significant enhancements to the family tax credit and the foster care allowance, orphans benefit and unsupported child benefit; and the  accommodation supplement;We also reinstated the independent earners tax credit and increased paid parental leave to 26 weeks. I have seen the results of the first year of the Families Package and can tell you that the $5.5 billion investment is lifting the incomes of New Zealanders and their families that need it the most.I will be making an announcement later this week about the impact of the Families Package in its first year.You will have often heard me talk about culture change at Work and Income. We all know that treating people with dignity and respect and ensuring they are able to access their full and correct entitlements can have such an impact on people who come to Work and Income for support.In an organization that employs over 7000 staff we are not perfect, but I am seeing some really positive changes and I’m pleased we are making progress in the right direction.As part of the overhaul we established the Welfare Expert Advisory Group In May 2018 to provide advice to the Government on options that could best give effect to our vision for the future direction of the social welfare system. In February this year we received their report titled ‘Whakamana Tangata’ and I want to once again acknowledge the passion, intellect and pragmatism that sat behind that report.  At the time of launching the report in May I noted that we would be taking action in areas where we believed immediate changes need to be made these were:addressing financial support with a focus on child wellbeingsupporting people who are able to be earning, learning, caring and volunteeringImproving access to affordable housing.In terms of progress against the immediate priorities you’ll know well the changes we were able to commit to in the last budget, significantly for the first time in our history we will be indexing benefits to average wage increases. . This is a very important change to the fundamental settings of our welfare system. It is a long-term and enduring change. We were also able to lift abatement thresholds, repeal section 192, invest more into frontline staff to support people into employment, deliver more public housing and expand Housing First.  As you may have already heard me say before there are around 20 WEAG recommendations where work is underway or they are being actively considered whilst the remainder will need to be phased in as part of the medium and longer term, work programme. Overhauling the welfare system is a large, expensive, complicated task with many moving parts and was always going to take more than one term of government. As I’m sure you will appreciate many of the proposed changes for the welfare overhaul have fiscal implications and are therefore Budget sensitive so I am limited in what I can say today. But I can give you a guide to the government’s longer term intentions within the welfare space. In the medium-term 2 – 4 years, we will be focused on: Re-setting the foundations of the welfare system Increasing income support and addressing debtstrengthening and expanding employment servicesimproving supports and services for disabled people, people with health conditions and disabilities and their carers  enhancing the community sectorIn the longer term, 4 to 5 years and beyond, we will be focused on: Simplifying the income support system Aligning the welfare system with other support systems and Reviewing housing and childcare supports I would like to talk to you now about the importance of taking an all of government approach to the overhaul of the welfare system.  This is something that’s highlighted in the WEAG report. The report says - improving outcomes for people on low incomes or those in  the welfare system requires a cross-government response and cannot be  changed by  the welfare system alone. What happens in other parts of the social sector influences who comes into the welfare system. For example we know that people on jobseekers who have not attained NCEA level 1 are estimated to have more than twice the future years on benefit than those with NCEA level 3 or higher.  The WEAG report also says that a significant group of people and families experience multiple and long-term disadvantage and need to interact with several government systems. This group requires a responsive, person-centred, joined up system of support if their outcomes are to improve. I wholeheartedly agree. And that’s why I would like to talk now about the issues that are having a huge impact for people and their families in the welfare system – housing and mental illness. . Since being in government we have seen a rise in special needs grants and assistance being given out at MSD. This shows that people are coming forward because they know they won’t be turned away. That’s part of the culture change at the Ministry of Social Development to ensure that when people come in for help – that they get access to their full and legal entitlements in the welfare system. But underpinning the drive for grants is the cost of housing.. After years of underinvestment in our housing system and following the selloff of state houses – it has had a huge impact on New Zealanders but particularly those in the welfare system. The highest demand for Special Needs grants are in places where there is a severe shortage of affordable housing like in Auckland and the Bay of Plenty. MSD says housing need is the number one reason that people need assistance for other grants such as food. In addition to the financial impacts of unaffordable housing, housing is a key determinant of a person’s ability to engage with the labour market, their security, financial and social resilience and their stress and mental wellbeing.The government has provided more than 2300 public housing places since we came into office and we are on target to build 6400 over four years.  But more needs to be done. There are now over 1 million New Zealanders living in rental accommodation and 43% of these households contain children. The renting system is outdated and it negatively impacts people in the welfare system and working people on low incomes the most. That’s why yesterday Associate Minister of Housing (Public Housing) Kris Faafoi announced the government would limit rent increases to once every 12 months and ban the solicitation of rental bids by landlords. This will improve tenant’s security by removing a landlord’s right to use no cause terminations to end a periodic tenancy agreement.But most importantly the changes announced yesterday will ensure that there will be less regular rent increases. Renters will have the ability to make minor improvements and make their house a home for their families and children. The bill to amend the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, will be introduced to Parliament in the first half of 2020.In August, I announced along with Minister Faafoi $54 million in Government funding for initiatives which will support at-risk individuals and whānau to stay in their existing tenancies.The Sustaining Tenancies programme ensures that tenants who may be at-risk of losing their tenancy receive practical support to help them get back on track. We also invested in intensive case managers and social services to provide wrap around support for people with complex issues that are living in emergency accommodation. Many of them face barriers to finding and keeping a home because of their criminal history, mental health, addictions or family violence. We all know here in this room that the social and financial costs of homelessness are huge – from people not being able to work, kids not being able to attend school regularly and people becoming sick. Over 50% of people on main benefits have some sort of disability or are caring for someone with a disability. Mental illness is a huge factor for people on benefit. I believe that we have only scratched the surface on how much mental illness impacts on New Zealand society but especially for those people in the welfare system. I have seen health and welfare data from the MedCentral region. The data shows us that many people on main benefits including the jobseekers benefit are accessing mental health medication or counselling for mental illness, yet they haven’t disclosed this information to MSD, through the provision of a Doctor’s certificate. Moreover, the data shows that these people were working and accessing mental health medications and support before they fell out of work and came into the welfare system. We can do so much more in this space to intervene early to ensure working people get the help they need to stay in work and also give people in the welfare system better support to get better and to return to work.  That’s why the Government invested $1.9 billion in improving mental health services at the budget. That includes a $455 million package for frontline services for 325,000 people who need mental health support before they experience major problems.Trained mental health workers will be placed in doctors’ clinics, iwi health providers and other health services so that when people seek help it is easy to access and immediately available for those suffering mental health issues.Just last week I released the government’s Disability Action Plan which has 25 work programs across government agencies that have an explicit focus on improving outcomes for disabled people, many of whom are in the welfare system. Improving access to housing and employment for disabled New Zealanders is a huge focus.        74% of working age disabled people who are not in paid employment, would like to work if a job was available.I will be releasing the draft disability employment action plan for consultation before the end of the month. So we are starting to build a picture on what needs to be done. It confirms that the government’s investments are in the right places. But after years of underinvestment it will take time to fix. Across all of Government—we have an absolute focus on child wellbeing and child poverty reduction. Our aspiration is that all children can reach their potential and that they’re supported to do so. Finally, I want to close by saying that whilst it’s me standing here today as the Minister of Social Development this is actually a government program of change. To get to this place where we can look towards a phased longer term plan has really relied on cross Ministerial and Party agreement. We are committed to this work and we are looking to your necessary critique, advocacy and support to realize a fair, accessible and fit for purpose welfare system in Aotearoa NZ Once again thank you for the time to speak today please enjoy the rest of the conference.

Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, ka nui te mihi, ki a koutou.Hello everyone, warm greetings to you all.Specifically can I acknowledge Iwi, Māori, and community leaders here this afternoon - tena koutou katoa.I am delighted to be here, in front of a group of people who have long dedicated themselves to the Māori Crown partnership, and to the Māori Police partnership. Thank you for this opportunity to be with you today to help launch Te Huringa o Te Tai strategy that sets out a pathway for Police in leadership with Iwi Māori, to achieve the aspirations of Māori whānau.I believe this strategy, based on Turning of the Tide and the hard work of Māori and Police, will continue to be a strong momentum for change. The fact that you are all here today is a testament to how important this is for both Māori and Police.Safer Communities Together – PartnershipsNew Zealand Police’s motto is Safer Communities Together. For a moment I want to focus on the word “together”.“Together” is about New Zealand Police working with all of New Zealand’s diverse communities, and working with a range of valuable partners, to make New Zealand the Safest Country and enhance security at home and in the Pacific.Of course in New Zealand, the Crown has a unique treaty relationship with Māori and our Government is focused towards living up to being a Treaty partner that meets the expectations of Māori on issues of importance to us both. Through collaborative effort we all want to see positive change to create a better future for all Māori in New Zealand.And we can do it – Police has been transforming their response and lifting their service delivery for Māori, and this strategy, Te Huringa o Te Tai, will push us forward to meet the expectations of our communities.We all agree that improving the wellbeing of Māori will improve the wellbeing of all our communities across New Zealand.  This Government is committed to: improving the intergenerational wellbeing of whānau, supporting Māori to realise the potential of their whenua, working together with Māori by building closer partnerships, and promoting a whānau-centered approach across government.We also want to change the story of rangatahi in our regions through training and employment to ensure they have positive opportunities for a bright future.I see many great initiatives that Police are part of, that are helping to change that story – driver licensing initiatives and Te Pae Oranga iwi panels are just two examples of Police’s new approach.Acknowledgment of Parihaka – 5 NovemberI want to acknowledge that yesterday – 5 November – was the anniversary of the Parihaka invasion in 1881, and that the Crown troops were the face of the Crown on that day.Reflecting on an event such as Parihaka, and the hurt that has travelled through the years and generations from that day adds to my understanding of why many Māori don’t have full trust and confidence in the Crown or Police.Gaining trust and support is a long process, but is so necessary if we are to address the underlying causes of offending and victimisation which disproportionally impact on Māori.The Parihaka Reconciliation Bill – Te Pire Haeata ki Parihaka has passed its third reading, and is part of a journey of reconciliation between Parihaka and the Crown. “Haeata” means “dawn” and signifies a new beginning. The Parihaka people remain determined to shape their own future, just as our Iwi Māori leaders are determined to see better outcomes for whānau in the criminal justice system.While the system will refer to them as offenders and victims, they are whānau first - brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers - and the more we collectively can do, to direct Māori away from entering the criminal justice system, the stronger our communities will be.Delivering on the expectations of MāoriIt is important that the Police organisation and all its staff understand the expectations of Māori and the whakapapa that exists between us – as Māori and Police, and as Māori and the Crown. Having this understanding is incredibly important for Police to be able to deliver its obligations under the Māori Crown relationship.This means that Police direction, initiatives, models and in fact all Police work needs to reflect the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi – Partnership, Participation, and Protection.Police, as we see in their core value “Commitment to Māori and the Treaty”, are on board as willing partners.I’m pleased to see efforts to enhance diversity within Police are paying off – because for Police to be truly effective, our police officers must reflect Aotearoa New Zealand as a whole. When the public look at their police officers, they need to see people like them looking back.At the last graduation of new constables, 27 percent of them identified as Māori, and in the past two financial years the number of Māori police officers has increased by 16 percent. Māori now make up 12.6 percent of the Constabulary workforce.Closing Throughout the development of Te Huringa o Te Tai, Police have sought the views and listened to the voices of Iwi Māori leaders, whānau, communities, service providers, rangatahi, kuia, kaumatua, Māori Wardens, Police staff, and our government partners.I thank all of these groups of people who have come together to contribute.I know everyone here is really passionate about this strategy and I commend you for that passion, and for the expertise, thought and hard work that has gone into it. I recognise the past has had a profoundly negative effect on Māori, and that we need to do our utmost to move to a better future for all. I want to leave you with this whakataukī:Haere whakamua titiro whakamuri.Let us walk into the future with our eyes open to the past.Ngā mihi."
2021-04-07T22:23:23Z,        Hon Dr Megan Woods,  ERANZ speech April 2021,"It is a pleasure to be here tonight.  Thank you Cameron for the introduction and thank you for ERANZ for also hosting this event. Last week in fact, we had one of the largest gatherings in our sector, Downstream 2021.I have heard from my officials that the discussion on both days was robust and highlighted some of the real issues our sector will be dealing with.There was also plenty of discussion about the New Zealand Battery project and Labour’s election pledge to bringing forward our target of 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2030 so we can decarbonise our electricity system faster.  We have heard the views that achieving 100 per cent renewable electricity is too difficult or expensive, or that we should focus on decarbonising other areas of the energy system first. But these views wrongly assume that we can only achieve progress on one thing at a time. I believe we must focus on all our levers. You will all be aware of the Climate Change Commission’s draft advice on the first three emissions budgets. It confirms the reality of the climate change response New Zealand must make.The proposed emissions reductions pathways, aimed at meeting the net-zero carbon target by 2050, are ambitious, but they also recognise what is technologically and economically realistic.Once the Commission provides its final report the Government will consider the advice and we will develop our first Emissions Reduction Plan for New Zealand. We cannot wait and hope our way toward a low emissions future and the energy sector is going to have to do some heavy lifting.So it has been heartening to see recent renewable energy investment decisions by some generators.Contact is developing a new 152 megawatt, $580 million geothermal power station at Tauhara near Taupō, which I had the pleasure of visiting last week, while Meridian Energy will build New Zealand’s second-largest windfarm near Napier - a 41-turbine, 176 megawatt project - at a cost of $395 million.Removing fossil fuels from our electricity system, while we also increase electricity demand, will be challenging, so we are getting on with the task of finding a solution.The New Zealand Battery project has been set up to address the issue of New Zealand’s lack of dry year storage in our electricity system. The first phase is an initial feasibility study to identify the best options to achieve this objective.The study is looking at pumped hydro at Lake Onslow, as well as other smaller scale pumped hydro options, with other technologies being assessed as comparators. Lake Onslow is   providing a useful ‘base case’ to which to compare these other technologies. The only way we will know if Lake Onslow is a viable option is if we do this initial work. Good progress is being made and I will soon be announcing the members of the Technical Reference Group. I am conscious that we are currently experiencing high electricity wholesale prices, with hydro lakes being relatively low for this time of year.Gas supplies are tight, and tighter than might have been expected a year ago, largely due to declining production from the Pohokura gas field.In these circumstances I expect wholesale electricity spot prices to be higher than average, but I question whether they need to be as high as they have recently been.I also question whether forward wholesale contract prices for the coming months are higher than they need be.Many businesses buy electricity at wholesale prices, or are exposed to spot prices, and they are suffering.Retail prices for commercial customers and households are also rising, which may reflect rising wholesale prices. Electricity consumers can ill-afford higher power prices.This is why I have asked officials for advice on the level of wholesale prices.I want to be assured that the current level of wholesale prices is commensurate with the level of scarcity in the market and the risk of a shortage later this year.And I want to know what, if anything, might be done to moderate wholesale prices without increasing the risk of a power shortages.The Electricity Authority has a work programme to improve performance of the wholesale market – I am not asking officials to duplicate that work.How the electricity market will operate with a large pumped hydro scheme or other options to manage dry years will be explored as part of the NZ Battery project.And I have already asked the Gas Industry Company to investigate the functioning of the gas market and report back by the middle of the year.As well as climate change goals, and ensuring the market is working well, this Government is also focussed on ensuring affordable energy in New Zealand. We need an agile, competitive and innovative energy market to ensure energy prices remain affordable. The Electricity Price Review in 2018 found that while the market is working well overall, it is not delivering for everyone, and many people struggle with the cost of power. A number of work streams are underway in response to its recommendations including:the establishment of a Consumer Advocacy Council and an energy hardship expert panel and reference group   Development of an agreed definition of energy hardship and indicators to measure progressWe have set up a $17 million fund to support consumer advocacy and energy hardship to progress this work.And we introduced the  Winter Energy Payment, which gives up to $750 a year to people to heat their homes in winter.  Another EPR recommendation was to phase out the low fixed charge regulation as they don’t send the right price signals and  unintentionally shift costs to households with low incomes and high electricity consumption.While I accept the findings of the Review, I remain concerned about the impact phasing out these regulations could have on consumers. I have asked my officials to further explore options to support vulnerable consumers through the phase out.I am very interested in hearing from industry how they can support this transition.ERANZ is doing its bit to address energy hardship. In September 2020, I launched the extended pilot for EnergyMate. The pilot has now expanded to deliver at eight different locations including South Taranaki, South Auckland, Rotorua, Lower Hutt, Levin, Kaitaia, Dunedin, and Christchurch. For the industry, EnergyMate continues to assist with the relationship between vulnerable customers and their electricity company. It has the potential to empower families to be more proactive in approaching their retailer when experiencing energy hardship.I would also like to acknowledge the Electricity Retailers’ Association members and partners for showing leadership in delivering practical and tangible solutions to energy hardship. I want to acknowledge the joint effort across the sector and community organisations. These groups already have strong connections with their communities and without their support it would be that much harder to help.It is hard to imagine that it has been a year since New Zealand went into alert level four and the entire nation went into lockdown. I want to thank ERANZ and the rest of the industry for its focus on keeping the lights on for consumers, and keeping disconnection level low during that time and in the subsequent change in alert levels.    Last year we launched $70 million Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry (GIDI) Fund to help businesses adopt energy efficiency measures and switch from fossil fuels like coal and gas to clean energy for process heat. This part of the energy sector accounts for 9 per cent of our [gross] emissions, so GIDI is a great example of how we are investing in a more sustainable economy.I’m very much looking forward to announcing the first tranche of projects very, very soon.The phase-out of natural gas from our energy system is an important but complex task. As we transition, our natural gas market will need to continue to provide secure and affordable energy for our electricity system, and keep some of our major manufacturing companies operating. The question for the Government is how we can best support this phase-out, while ensuring that consumers can still access the energy they need.I have also seen interesting results from the hydrogen network trial that was part funded by the Government.FirstGas intends to blend hydrogen into the North Island natural gas network from 2030, with conversion to a 100 per cent hydrogen grid by 2050.  An exciting prospect indeed as we move toward a low-emissions economy.I have asked the GIC to investigate the current settings in the natural gas market around contractual arrangements and how these affect the overall availability and flexibility of natural gas.Meanwhile, we are amending the Gas Act to provide clear regulatory powers for information disclosure issues that may have significant downstream impacts, such as on electricity markets, or create risks for security of supply.The resolution of deal between Meridian and New Zealand’s Aluminium Smelter means we now have a greater understanding and knowledge of the short term national electricity supply and demand picture until 2024.The extended timeline for the smelter’s operations provides a valuable opportunity to work with stakeholders to transition of the Southland economy, develop potential new uses of the smelter site, and for Transpower to open up new options for the use of Manapouri’s electricity elsewhere in the country.Areas I am particularly proud of, some which I have already raised include:The initiatives to addressing energy hardship and the affordability of energy. The findings of the Electricity Price Review are critical to ensure our energy supply remain affordable for all users. The Clean Car Standard, and addressing the emissions of our vehicle fleet.Launching the NZ Battery project to investigate methods to address the dry-year risk. I look forward to a productive and interesting time ahead for the Energy and Resources portfolio. So, to wrap up, I think this is a very exciting time to be involved in the energy sector as we take significant steps toward decarbonising our economy."
2021-03-31T22:58:57Z,        Hon Willie Jackson,"  Ahuwhenua Trophy Competition Field Day - Tātaiwhetū Trust at Tauarau Marae, Rūātoki","*** Please check against delivery ***It’s an honour to be here in Rūātoki today, a rohe with such a proud and dynamic history of resilience, excellence and mana. Tūhoe moumou kai, moumou taonga, moumou tangata ki te pō.The Ahuwhenua Trophy competition is the legacy of a seed planted 88 years ago by Tā Apirana Ngata and Lord Bledisloe. They wanted whānau Māori to aspire to better standards of farming and to showcase Māori excellence.Today, we acknowledge the talented Māori dairy farmers and farms that embody that legacy and vision. The farmers who today, are kaitiaki for their environments and for generations of their whānau. The legacy of Land Consolidation This valley and this farm have direct links to those two great leaders, Tā Apirana Ngata and Lord Bledisloe, and their legacy. It was here at Tauarau Marae in 1921, that Sir Apirana Ngata held that important Land Consolidation meeting to float the idea of subdividing the land into productive units that would still support families to live their lives on their whenua. As with all discussions around whenua, it wasn’t taken lightly, and the hui ran for over a month.Nearly a decade later, Lord Bledisloe, visited Rūātoki to check in on the Consolidation Scheme and its progress. Sadly, by the mid-1950s, it was painfully clear the land blocks were far too small for whānau to thrive.On top of that, local Tūhoe farmers relied on cows culled from Pākehā farms. They had the leftovers, hardly prime farming livestock, so they couldn’t get decent production levels to make a decent income. Many Tūhoe whānau were forced to walk off their land in search of employment and income. Lots of them are still there today.Meanwhile, the whenua was left desolate. But your tīpuna and your parents never stopped wanting to get back to use their whenua ūkaipō as their source of prosperity, wellbeing and Tūhoetanga.  Reconnecting with whenuaKnowing this not-so-distant history makes looking at this impressive operation today all the more poignant. All the more of an achievement. The beginning of the regeneration came in 1986 when six Ngatirongo families agreed to combine their lands to form the Ngatirongo Trust Farm.Today, it is an example of dairy farming excellence.Whenua reformsThis is what I look forward to seeing more of. This is what we are working to achieve with whānau throughout the country.Already this year significant law changes have happened to make it easier for more Māori landowners to connect with and use their whenua. In the last few days, in fact, changes to the rating of Māori land mean that unrecoverable rate debt on any land; including rates debts inherited from deceased owners can be written-off by councils immediately.In addition, Māori land that is completely unused will be non-rateable, and rates arrears on unused Māori land automatically removed.It’s the first time this legislation has been updated in 100 years. It’s huge for our people.It’s all part of the wider mahi Te Puni Kōkiri is doing for Māori landowners to get them back on their own land to live prosperous, connected lives of opportunities and hope.Example for the future Tātaiwhetū Farms - you can proudly take your place alongside this year’s other outstanding Ahuwhenua Trophy – Excellence in Māori Dairy Farming Award finalists - Pouarua Farms and Tunapahore B2A Incorporation.Not only have you been selected as an Ahuwhenua Trophy finalist, but you’ve also earned other awards for your environmental work protecting wetlands and historical places on the farm, and accolades for your work in biodiversity.And to boot, you have transitioned from conventional milking to certified organic. Tātaiwhetū Farms, you and your fellow nominees, are excellent examples for the future. Examples of whānau Māori who are dedicated to lifting the wellbeing of whānau and sustainably developing your whenua to its full potential.Your commitment to caring for our people, our land and our waterways will endure across generations – just as Tā Apirana and Lord Bledisloe had wished.Nui te mihi ki a koutou katoa.

2021-03-30T22:00:45Z,        Hon Phil Twyford,  Speech to Disarmament and Security Centre,"Kia ora tatou.It’s great to be here today and to get a conversation going on the disarmament issues of greatest interest to you, and to the Government. I’m thrilled to be standing here as a dedicated Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control, which I hope reinforces for you all – and for our friends and partners offshore – how serious this Government is about pursuing New Zealand’s objectives in this portfolio. I want to thank the Disarmament and Security Centre, and in particular centre coordinator Lucy Stewart for hosting this visit. And I want to especially acknowledge my old friends Kate Dewes and Rob Green who have done so much over the decades to keep hope alive. You two have contributed so much to our country’s great and honourable tradition of peace and anti-nuclear activism.We often talk about the historical connection New Zealanders have to disarmament issues – in particular nuclear disarmament but also to the movements that banned inhumane weapons such as landmines and cluster munitions. This is, indeed, an important part of our whakapapa, and the reputation and credibility New Zealand has on disarmament issues today reflects the consistency and effectiveness of our past efforts, by both government and civil society, by grassroots movements and political parties. It is equally important to recognise our work on disarmament is not simply an automatic continuation of what we have always done. Our movement has always adapted and changed to take on new challenges. In these times of competing priorities and strained resources, we cannot just continue to work on the same things in the same ways because it is familiar and comfortable, or because it feels good.  When we are faced with an ever expanding list of complex challenges, both internationally and at home, we must be thoughtful and practical about where we are putting our effort. It should go without saying however that the pursuit of a world free from nuclear weapons, and a world where civilians in conflict zones are much better protected, are goals all governments should accord the highest priority. The International EnvironmentBut the global environment we are operating in, as it pertains to those goals, is as you will be aware far from conducive.  The return to the tensions of the Cold War has put long-standing and important frameworks under threat, undermining New Zealand’s interests in the international rules based order as well as our own national security. Frictions between the world’s superpowers have led to many disarmament setbacks, include a new nuclear arms race, expanding roles for nuclear weapons in military doctrines, and flagrant violations of the rules and norms against the use of chemical weapons. They are also being felt in the conventional weapons space, where efforts to continue strengthening international humanitarian law are often slowed down or frustrated by broader geostrategic frictions. The rapid pace of progress in technology is a further challenge, with international concern mounting about the sustainability of outer space and the spectre of fully autonomous weaponry.Of course the picture is not all bad. There is some cause for optimism, including the early decision of the Biden Administration, working with Russia, to extend the New START treaty and the limits it imposes on the nuclear arsenals of both countries. And the entry into force  of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons has given a much-needed boost to momentum on nuclear disarmament. These developments are positive and open a small window of opportunity we must seize. Strategic rivalries and the decline of multilateralism don’t weaken the case for urgent action on disarmament and arms control, they make it stronger.New Zealand’s Values-Based Foreign PolicyIt is against this backdrop that we develop our ambitions and plans for disarmament in 2021. Equally relevant is our domestic context, and I want to draw your attention to the speech delivered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Honourable Nanaia Mahuta, at Waitangi. That speech laid out the Minister’s vision for New Zealand’s approach to foreign policy, and is directly relevant to our efforts on disarmament. In particular, the Minister reiterated New Zealand’s core interests in an international rules based order, which gives all countries a voice and provides frameworks that promote stability; in keeping New Zealanders safe; and in global action on sustainability issues where solutions depend on international cooperation. The Minister also articulated a values-based approach to our work, highlighting four values in particular:• manaaki – kindness or the reciprocity of goodwill;• whanaunga – our connectedness or shared sense of humanity;• mahi tahi and kotahitanga – collective benefits and shared aspiration; and,• kaitiaki – protectors and stewards of our intergenerational wellbeing.These values resonate with our work on disarmament. Our policies have always reflected humanitarian values alongside the clear recognition that disarmament and international humanitarian law make a direct and concrete contribution to global security and to the safety of New Zealand and New Zealanders. This is true for our enduring work on nuclear disarmament, cluster munitions, landmines and the Arms Trade Treaty. And it is true, too, for the newer issues on which we are looking to step up our engagement - the use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas, Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (or LAWS), and the peaceful uses of outer space.Emerging Issues – Outer Space & Autonomous WeaponsIt is on two of these emerging issues – LAWS and outer space – that I’d like to focus for a moment.  At the outset I should perhaps make clear that our work on such issues is very much in progress. What I want to do here, though, is not lay out a detailed articulation of policy options, but rather give you a sense of why these issues are important for New Zealand and how I hope to move forward on them.In many ways, these two issues are among the most challenging in the disarmament portfolio. They do not fall neatly into a category of weapons with clear definitions, nor are they able to be viewed through either a strictly humanitarian disarmament lens or one focused solely on strategic considerations. Rather, they are examples of complex public policy challenges with important legal, military, political, ethical and technical dimensions.   LAWS, for example, raise important questions for New Zealand (and indeed for all countries) about the ability of such weapons to comply with international humanitarian law, and about the risks they might pose to regional and global stability and security, and to ethics and human rights. As a staunch advocate of IHL, we are concerned by the prospect that key decisions might be made autonomously, or delegated to machine processes. International humanitarian law must require some form of meaningful human control over weapons systems and we need measures to ensure this.  In pursuing these, however, we need to be careful to balance this against the legitimate needs of our own defence force, including their ability to work alongside international partners; and nor do we want – on the other hand – to curtail the development of autonomous technologies for commercial or civilian application, whether in health or transport. In the same way, ensuring the safe, secure, sustainable and peaceful use of outer space will require a suite of policies that reflect our values as well as our interests. Of course we are not starting from zero, and already have a robust regulatory system governing our domestic approach to space launches and the payloads they can deliver. This system upholds our existing domestic and international legal obligations, while supporting a vibrant and growing industry. It also takes into account our increasing dependence on space-based infrastructure to support daily life and to help us tackle other challenges more effectively – be they climate change, illegal fishing, or disaster response.It is against this backdrop that New Zealand must also start to address the complexities surrounding space debris and the utilisation of space resources, as well as concerns about the militarisation and weaponisation of space. This will again require us to take into consideration our broader foreign policy and disarmament interests as well as our commercial interests in space.  Navigating these issues is unquestionably important for New Zealand but it will be challenging.Developing policy at the national level is not enough. Space is a great commons, and it is going to take a multilateral approach to protect it for the future.Our position as one of only 11 countries with space launch capabilities inspires us to play an active role in developing the rules and norms that are needed to preserve the global commons of outer space for future generations.  And as a country with a strong commitment to ensuring our Defence Force is fit for purpose, well-equipped and a champion of international humanitarian law, we must also play our part in addressing the risks posed by Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems.  We also can’t be naive to the external threats that exist, nor the exceptional contribution our defence force has made in recent conflicts, to improve stability, in the Pacific and beyond. Our challenge, then, is to develop policies that are right for New Zealand, and that can play a meaningful and constructive role in the elaboration of global norms and rules on both these issues. In doing so, we will draw on our decades of disarmament activism, making the most of the interest and expertise we have both at home and abroad. As we have done in the past, we will work with partner governments, international organisations, civil society, academia, think tanks and others, striving to ensure we involve and reflect diverse perspectives.  Given this is an issue of profound importance to future generations, we will be engaging with young people to raise awareness and invite views. This approach has been at the heart of our success on traditional disarmament issues and I’m confident it will position New Zealand as a creative, constructive and credible player on these emerging issues. Disarmament and Arms Control Agenda for 2021This emphasis on new challenges does not mean that New Zealand will be taking a step back on our long-standing work on nuclear disarmament, or on our advocacy on conventional weapons. On the contrary. Across the board I have made engagement a personal priority since taking on the portfolio This has included constructive bilateral conversations with key international organisations like the UN and IAEA, civil society groups such as ICAN, and our traditional state allies in this space such as Ireland. I took part in the first meeting of States Parties to the Treaty of Rarotonga late last year, which as you will all know forms an important part of our regional arms control architecture. I have met twice with our own Public Advisory Committee on Disarmament and Arms Control, and throughout this year will be holding a number of events like this one today across the country to outline the Government’s agenda, and build the relationship between government and civil society.I said before that the challenging international environment makes progress on disarmament even more urgent.New Zealand has long held the view that progress on nuclear disarmament can contribute to building trust and confidence between states, and to creating an environment where further reductions in tensions – and in armaments – is possible. This is not a naïve view – but was one that has been tested and proven both during the Cold War and more recently. New Zealand will therefore continue leading and advocating for nuclear disarmament, both as a contribution to global security and in recognition of the catastrophic humanitarian consequences any use of nuclear weapons would certainly entail. Our efforts will focus on both the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and on the NPT, which we see as compatible and mutually reinforcing. As I made clear in my speech celebrating the entry into force of the TPNW on 22 January, New Zealand is a proud advocate of this Treaty and will be promoting its uptake and engaging actively in preparations for the First Meeting of States Parties scheduled for January 2022.  We will be working closely with our Pacific neighbours in this context, including on legacy issues relating to history of nuclear testing in the region. At the same time, New Zealand will continue our many efforts to advance nuclear disarmament within the NPT – including through the New Agenda Coalition and as a member of the Stockholm Initiative. We are eager to see progress by the nuclear weapon States on the implementation of their long-standing nuclear disarmament commitments, and – as an interim measure – see nuclear risk reduction as an urgent priority. Although we were buoyed by the extension of New START earlier in the year, we are concerned and disappointed by recent backwards steps on nuclear disarmament and will be working actively to promote a more promising approach at the forthcoming Review Conference. New Zealand’s strong support for addressing nuclear proliferation challenges such as Iran and North Korea, and for strengthening the non-proliferation regime, is also an important part of our approach to the NPT.  We see concrete progress on nuclear disarmament as a crucial enabler of further steps on nuclear non-proliferation.I also want to emphasise New Zealand’s ongoing commitment to humanitarian disarmament through ongoing work on cluster munitions, landmines and the Arms Trade Treaty – and to continuing our unwavering support for the rules, norms and institutions prohibiting chemical weapons and nuclear testing. In particular, I am motivated to see New Zealand playing its part to improve the protection of civilians in urban conflicts particularly through the curtailment of explosive weapons’ use. Making meaningful progress on this issue must be a priority. Finally, I want to underline the core belief that sustains our disarmament work. That by working together with others we can make the world safer. That cooperation and multilateralism are the only alternatives to a twentieth century view of the world that sees firing missiles into your neighbour’s backyard or a new arms race as rational responses to an uncertain world. New Zealand has always stood for a rules based order. It is what works best for us and we believe it is best for the planet. And as we rise to the particular security challenges of the early 21st century, it is more important than ever.Now that you’ve all heard from me, I want to turn the floor over to you. I am interested in a dialogue on disarmament – I welcome your opinions, advice, criticism and ideas. As I mentioned earlier, one of the reasons why I think New Zealand has had such success internationally on disarmament issues is because of our recognition of the integral role that civil society and academia have to play in this work. As experts, advocates, inventors and entrepreneurs, energisers, force multipliers and strategists – there is little than can be achieved on disarmament without your support. I am determined to build and make the most of our relationships so that, together, we can really make a difference on these issues.

2021-03-30T04:07:57Z,        Hon Willie Jackson,  2021 Waitangi Tribunal Members’ Conference Speech ,"*** please check against delivery ***Commitment resolute during a challenging timeTēnā rā koutou katoa, it is my honour to be here today to address members of the Waitangi Tribunal.  Since my fellow colleague, Minister Nanaia Mahuta, stood before you three years ago no one would have imagined a pandemic would have such a hold on the world and how we live.But we, as Māori, have shown we can and are able to support our communities. We are resilient and we can continually strive to adapt, to work, and to support our whānau, hapū and iwi.Likewise, the Tribunal has continued to achieve its strategic goals during this disruptive time. Having time today to reflect and acknowledge your work and commitment is important.  You have maintained momentum by taking time to review your priorities and objectives since setting your strategic goals in 2014.  This sets a pathway for claimants and the Crown that is clear and ensures you are continually addressing the remaining claims and inquiries. This is no mean feat but a demonstration of Tribunal members and staff dedication despite the challenges we have experienced. Kei runga noa atu koutou. Ka nui te mihi.Acknowledging outstanding rangatiraI must also give a special mihi to three esteemed rangatira. Firstly, I wish to acknowledge the substantial contribution Professor Tā Hirini Moko Mead has made to the Tribunal since his appointment in 2003.  His tireless efforts, wise counsel, and leadership over almost two decades have been invaluable to Tribunal members, to the Crown and to claimant groups.Tā Hirini has made significant contributions to mediation between the Crown and claimant groups to settle their claims and provided his deep knowledge and leadership in the Tribunal’s Governance Group.  You’ve left a considerable legacy Tā Hirini and I wish you well in your retirement.Secondly, to Professor Pou Temara, I certainly value the expertise and experience you bring as a Māori academic to the work of the Waitangi Tribunal.  Lastly, I also wish to acknowledge Judge Heta Hingston who passed away last August. His contribution to the Māori Land Court, particularly his decision on Māori ownership of the foreshore and seabed and the Tribunal in the 1990’s was exceptional.He kupu whakamanahau, he kupu whakamihi. KAUPAPAMy Cabinet role advocating for Māori I too am ambitious for Māori achievement.The Māori Affairs portfolio stretches the breadth of many issues challenging our Māori communities from Māori wellbeing, employment, housing, through to Māori economic recovery.  It also spans areas like te reo Māori with a focus on Māori media and broadcasting, and it is a privilege to hold this portfolio. I also have responsibility for recommending Tribunal appointments to the Governor-General.Alongside a record number of Māori ministerial colleagues in Cabinet, I am in a position to influence the broader government programmeI will make sure the challenges that Māori face, their needs, and aspirations are recognised in Cabinet decision-making.Today, I want to share with you the changing Waitangi Tribunal role as more claims relate to issues of national significance, my ministry’s involvement in kaupapa inquiries, and some of our priorities to address the inequities facing our Māori communities.Treaty settlement and a path towards equity Our government holds Māori wellbeing as a priority and this means setting conditions to achieve equitable outcomes for our people. Ones that recognise the value of Te Ao Māori and which support a productive, inclusive, and sustainable economy.We intend to forge a path toward real equity for Māori, underpinned by a partnership, based on the articles of the Treaty of Waitangi.  Te Arawhiti is responsible for supporting the Māori Crown relationship, by building public sector capability to engage with Māori, ensuring Crown agencies meet their Treaty settlement commitments and administering the Marine and Coastal Area (Takutai Moana) Act 2011. Te Puni Kōkiri is the principal policy advisor to the Crown on Māori wellbeing and development.  This includes building Māori capability and capacity, monitoring the effectiveness of public services for Māori and leading policy advice on specific issues of importance to Māori.Changing role of the Waitangi Tribunal There has been steady progress made by the Tribunal over 2020 despite COVID-19 and postponement of hearings. I commend you all for the Tribunal’s tenacity to progress claims and inquiries amidst the uncertainty and associated restrictions.I am aware the Tribunal has been working on a programme to address both the remaining historical claims and to streamline the urgent inquiries. Completion of historical claims will allow the Tribunal more time and resources to focus on contemporary issues and transition further into the kaupapa and contemporary claims space.  The kaupapa inquiries are holding a mirror up to the Crown’s face, challenging its policies and the treatment of Māori, both historically and present day, in the implementation of these policies.These lessons from the past cannot correct the wrongs done, but they can provide valuable learnings.Inquiries are challenging our current policy settings and helping to reshape them to be more equitable. It is my hope that we see a better and improved partnership between Māori and the Crown that will benefit our mokopuna and future generations.   I am impressed with the Tribunal working with the Crown agencies to manage the needs of the claimants through the sequencing of inquiries, providing efficient resources, having an acute awareness of the issues at play and keeping stakeholders abreast of the progress of their claims.  Crown response to Tribunal reports and progress to dateAs a ministry, Te Puni Kōkiri is actively participating in kaupapa inquiries led by the Tribunal.Te Pae Tawhiti – Wai262 – Whole of Government approach One of these is Te Pae Tawhiti – Wai 262. This is the Crown’s first steps toward a whole of government response to issues raised by the Wai 262 claim and the subsequent Tribunal’s 2011 report Ko Aotearoa Tēnei. Hon Nanaia Mahuta retains delegation for coordinating the government response and she’s actively working on the next phase of this important kaupapa. As part of this mahi the original Wai262 claimants representative rōpū, Te Taumata Whakapūmau, is setting up a working group to lead the Māori to Māori kōrero. It’s important we retain the integrity of this claim through their kaitiaki role.Mana Wahine Inquiry - Wai 2700Te Puni Kōkiri is also co-leading the Crown response to Mana Wahine with the Ministry for Women.  The hearings started last month, and key themes will emerge over the coming months as they are heard around the motu.I wholeheartedly support the process of this Kaupapa Inquiry. The long-term challenges of Māori – especially Wāhine Māori – have been ignored for too long, and it’s crucial the Crown hears and understands the historic and contemporary claims.At the recent second tūāpapa hearing in Ngāruawāhia, the importance of strong wāhine Māori leadership in Waikato, from Te Puea and Dame Te Atairangikaahu to present-day leaders, set the scene for this hearing.It highlighted the importance of wāhine tupuna in their leadership roles, utilising their skills, and their life commitment to decisions that affect their whānau, whenua and whakapapa.Claimants raised contemporary ongoing issues including the impacts of urbanisation, reinvigorating the Māori/ Crown relationship, reconnecting urban whānau to their tūrangawaewae and developing pathways for wāhine Māori in leadership roles.The Inquiry will help us better understand how historical events have shaped many of the issues faced by wāhine Māori today providing an opportunity for us to work collectively to restore their mana and rangatiratanga.I know this Government will uphold the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi to improve the intergenerational wellbeing of our whānau by working in closer partnerships with wāhine Māori.Housing Policy and Services Inquiry Wai 2750Te Puni Kōkiri is also supporting Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) who leads the Crown response to the Housing Inquiry - Wai 2750.The initial focus of the Inquiry is homelessness for Māori. This is most urgent and has severe implications for Māori and the housing crisis. It is estimated that there are more than 12,800 Māori currently living with homelessness or housing insecurity.Māori Housing has been identified as a high priority for this Government and Wai 2750 will increase the focus. Te Puni Kōkiri will ensure the needs of Māori sit front and centre of the Governments Housing policy. As a contemporary issue, this is an area I want to see rapid progress in for Māori. Our communities have been neglected for too long; it needs to change.Strengthening Māori community resilience This Government’s priorities include health, housing, education, and employment. These are about addressing the huge inequities facing Māori communities. We are yet to see the long-term economic effects COVID will have on our economy.  It is troubling the industries hit hardest by the pandemic, such as tourism and hospitality, had a high concentration of Māori employees.  As we recover from the impacts of COVID-19, Te Puni Kōkiri will lead the Māori economic resilience strategy across agencies.The underpinning pou of this resilience strategy are Skills & Workforce, Community Resilience and Infrastructure and Māori Enterprise.Our focus is a long-term strategy that provides meaningful and lasting resilience for Māori.  Te Puni Kōkiri will work to improve data collection to determine the impacts on Māori and highlight emerging risks. It will look at what is being spent and see what works.   We will look for opportunities where tailored solutions can be developed to meet needs, such as improving the skills and qualifications of our Māori workforce. We must partner with other agencies to ensure we deliver for whānau Māori. Addressing the inequalities whānau Māori face is a waka the Government and all New Zealanders need to paddle together. The Tribunal’s work contributes to this ongoing mahi, and its recommendations can provide solutions that we, as the Crown and as Māori, can work collaboratively to achieve.Me he manawā tītī, me tōhona hirika, is a whakataukī I want to finish on as it is about the famed strength and perseverance of the tītī bird. Kia kaha to you, the Tribunal manawā tītī, in your resolve for progressing the claims and inquiries that are underway and lie ahead. Nō reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou katoa.   "
2021-03-30T01:23:01Z,        Hon Dr Megan Woods,  Speech to Palmerston North Housing Forum 2021,"  Tena koutou te hau kainga Rangitāne tena koutouNga mate huhua o te waa, haere haere haere atu raHoki mai kia tatou te kanohi ora e tau nei,Tena koutou tena koutou tena tatou katoa.Tēnā koutou i runga i te kaupapa o te Rā.No reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tatou katoa Thank you for the invitation to be here today. It is an honour to be invited to the first Palmerston North Housing Summit.I would like to acknowledge Wiremu Kingi Te Awe Awe, Rangitāne, and Mayor Grant Smith for the welcome. Tangi Utikere, my colleague and your local MP, Ian McKelvie MP & Nicola Willis MP.First of all, I thought I’d tell you a little about my own background and interest in housing.The history of New Zealand housing has by turns been a proud one, and one that in more recent times, one that is incredibly challenging for many people, which is why we are here today.I think we all appreciate it won’t be a short journey to change that course of history.This history is something that I have been personally interested in for many years – the doctor part of my name comes from a PHD in NZ history – more specifically a study of Māori urbanisation during and after WWII, and the housing policies that facilitated one of the swiftest rural urban shifts in history.That study not only looked at the houses and the policies but also led me to talk to many young men who came from around here to Christchurch to learn their trade in the 1950s and 1960s and are still there today.What I learned from my research was that governments need to be deliberate in their housing policies – following the war PM Fraser and his Labour government saw a problem in a massive housing shortage but they also saw an opportunity to train a generation with skilled trades and to rapidly build the houses that were so badly needed.As an historian, you would not be surprised to hear me say that there is much we can learn from the past; about what to do and what not to do. I also learned that housing is more than buildings, it’s about skills, jobs, place and wellbeing. But ultimately it is about people and their hopes, dreams and security. But ultimately it's all about people.Let’s start with your place.Your city, like other cities and town in New Zealand are growing, and the pace of building new housing, has not been keeping up.This puts pressure on lower-income households in terms of opportunities to get into home ownership, affordable rentals and state housing.This is why Palmerston North is one of the Government’s nine priority areas highlighted in the 2021 Public Housing Plan, where the need for public housing has grown the fastest and a step change in delivery is required. I’ll talk more about the Government’s role in Public Housing soon as well as the significant housing package we announced last week.But first I’ll just touch on the first changes we made when we came into Government to stem the housing crisis.We banned foreign speculators from buying homesWe introduced and passed legislation to increase housing in urban centres through the National Policy Statement on Urban Development – something councils are now working into their own planning rules.And we’re repealing and replacing the Resource Management Act to simplify planning.We brought in an Urban Development Act to put the interests of Maori, councils, developers and communities at the heart of developments, as well as the ability for councils to raise private sector funding for infrastructure.We also embarked on the biggest public housing programme in two decades, including through our Large Scale Projects which are delivering a mix of public, affordable and mixed housing.Our Homelessness Action Plan put us in good stead to house over one thousand people who were sleeping rough or in crowded situations when we were facing down COVID-19 with a nationwide lockdown. I know that there is a lot of flack about people being housed in motels - and I want to stress that I do not see motels as anything but a temporary and necessary means to putting a roof over someone’s head and into a bed, when they might otherwise be sleeping on the streets. Believe me no one would like to see us dial back on our motel bills more than me - however I am yet to hear from the critics the alternatives for those taking shelter there - we have doubled the number of transitional and emergency places we have since coming to office - there is more to do while we catch up on lack of supply but in the interim I am not prepared for those individuals and families to return to homelessness.On top of this Our Government has delivered nearly 5 and a half thousand public and transitional housing places (5,475 public housing new builds)  since 2017.And we are on target to deliver over 18,000 new public housing places by 2024. We brought in the much-criticised, but actually very innovative KiwiBuild model of underwrites, which have delivered nearly 800 homes, with another 800 currently under construction. Yes, we over reached with what we thought we could get done with KiwiBuild, and consequently we reset out targets. While it’s easy to sneer at KiwiBuild, we tried something that hadn’t been done here before and learned some lessons. The fact is there are thousands of Kiwis who have been helped into new, affordable homes, and the KiwiBuild model is helping get additional affordable market housing built.We have kaupapa Māori and whānau-centred approaches to enable delivery for Māori by Māori under Te MAIHI o te Whare Māori – the Māori and Iwi Housing Innovation Framework for ActionAnd we have  introduced the Progressive Home Ownership scheme that is enabling people who would otherwise never have a chance at home ownership, get on the housing ladder. A couple of weeks ago I attended the opening of a new 25 apartment building in Queenstown.A core belief of this Government is that everyone deserves a warm, dry secure home, whether they own or rent.This Government has not only rebuilt the state’s mandate to deliver housing, we have reconstructed its ability to plan, invest and make it possible for housing to be built at scale.Central to this ability is making sure we have enduring relationships grounded in partnerships and complementarity with the community housing sector. Baked into the DNA of our Labour government is a belief that the state should and does have a role in the delivery of housing - for us housing  is a fundamental thread in the social security safety net - without it, as we have seen, we are left with holes in the net. This is not to say there is not a role of others - i am enjoying my work with the sector to ensure we have the settings right to ensure that we are adding to housing stock in places of greatest need. Long-term contracts to unlock capital, changes to the rent maxima settings to allow building in more places, along with up front funding are for me what an enduring partnership will be built on. Last term in government, we spent time working with Maori and Iwi to build capacity in the Maori community housing sector - this term I want to work to build similar capacity in the Pacifika sector.All of this work programme has taught us what is possible when we match up the right land in the right place with good plans, and invest in the critical, but costly infrastructure that brings roads to our homes, and water to our taps. We have achieved an enormous amount as we’ve played catch up with addressing a housing market that has simply not built enough affordable or state houses.It’s taken many years to get us into this housing crisis and it will take more time to get out of it.There is ‘no silver bullet’ or quick fix.But the measures we have already introduced will bring about enduring, structural change to the way we plan and build new housing.Together, with our new package of measures, they will make a difference over time.Throughout last year – and as late as September – the economic rumblings surrounding COVID-19 were that house prices were expected to fall.  Economists were predicting slumps of up to 15%.That we came through COVID so successfully, through our country’s fantastic efforts to keep one another safe, delivered a much different outcome than anticipated for housing.We simply had to act to shift the dial from speculative investment toward giving first home owners a real chance.And we had to ensure we are providing the right incentives for investment in the building of new housing supply, so we are not forever in a cycle of competing for limited stock.The levers we announced last week include:Extension of the bright-line test to 10 years, with an exemption for new builds.Removal of the interest deductibility loophole for investors, which also have an exemption for new buildsA $3.8 billion Housing Acceleration Fund to increase housing supply in the short to medium term.Government support for Kainga Ora to borrow $2 billion extra to scale up land acquisition to boost housing supply.Extra support for first home buyers through changes to access to First Home Grants and Loans, so New Zealanders have a bit more help with breaking through into home ownership.The Apprenticeship Boost initiative, which has been extended so we keep growing the workforce to build new homes.Firstly, on the demand side measures to tilt the balance toward first home owners and away from speculative demand for housing:In the last quarter of 2020, 40% of house sales were to people who owned multiple properties and the amount borrowed by investors increased by 116% between June and November.We effectively have investors – including Mum and Dad investors – competing with their kids to buy up housing in the suburbs. This is unsustainable.We need new housing for both buyers and renters. New builds deliver prospects for both investors and those in need of new housing.There is also significant scope for investors to put their money into secure, purpose-built, affordable rentals, known as Build-to Rent opportunities, which will increase options for renters.I have been talking with developers and the community housing sector on how we can move this kind of vehicle further along.As we have investigated where the greatest housing needs are and what needs to be done to meet those needs, we’ve found out just how broken the system is for getting new housing, especially affordable housing, built.There is a clear market failure in getting new housing off the ground and a significant missing link is ready-to-build land with infrastructure in place.Councils and developers have told us this repeatedly. We have listened and responded.We need councils and developers – as well as communities, and Community Housing Providers to work with us to make the best possible use of not only the levers we announced last week, but all the tools we have implemented in our first term too, such as the National Policy Statement on Urban Development.We cannot do it alone.The Housing Acceleration Fund will jump-start housing developments connective land with infrastructure.  This fund will help green light developments that face infrastructure bottlenecks that might not otherwise progress.This is the first time since the 1970’s that the Government is investing in stitching these two components together in such a way, outside of our own Public Housing Programme, which is the biggest in two decades.Cabinet have made in-principle decisions about the fund but now we have announced it we can working with councils, iwi, the community sector and industry to finalise the criteria - i will be taking this to cabinet by the end of June and we expect to make our first investments in the second half of this year. We expect to see homes for people enabled by this fund within the next 12-18 months.The housing crisis did not start this year, or in 2017. The housing crisis is borne of decades of inaction to ensure affordable housing was being built and the state taking an active role in increasing public housing stock.We will have more announcements to make in the coming months, particularly in terms of Maori housing.We all need to pitch in and do what we can, where and when we can.I note that many politicians and commentators endlessly talk about the problem definition of the housing crisis.For me there is no semantic quibbling - there is a housing crisis.Let’s not spend our time debating what it is - but rather what the solutions are.We have the legislative tools set in place to turn this around.We have secured funding to lay the critical groundwork necessary for developments.And we’re ensuring that first home buyers have a much better chance of securing a step to the first rung on the ladder of home ownership.It’s up to all of us to keep doing the mahi to fix the housing crisis, which is to get more housing built and more places for people to call home.  "
2021-03-29T06:44:48Z,        Hon Nanaia Mahuta,  NZIIA Welcome to Cook Islands Prime Minister Brown,"Banquet Hall, 29 March 2021[CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY] Tēnā tātou katoa e tae mai nei i tēnei pōE ngā rangatira nongā motu i Kuki Airani, nau mai haere mai ki AotearoaKo te tūmanako e whai mai nei te mana o te wāhi-ngaro ki runga ki tō tātou noho tahi arā te huhuinga tangata, Tūra Hawaiiki! Prime Minister the Honourable Mark Brown, Mrs Brown and your delegation all the way from the Cook IslandsParliamentary colleagues, representatives of the diplomatic community, members of the Institute and to everyone here this evening: Kia orāna tātou kātoatoaIt is a pleasure to welcome you here tonight, and certainly fitting that the first official visit New Zealand has hosted since COVID is from one of our closest and most special partners: the Cook Islands.Although we’re separated by some 3000 km of Pacific Ocean, the links between the Cook Islands and Aotearoa reach all the way back to Ipukarea (the homeland) and the days of Te Ui Tupuna (the Polynesian voyagers).  And, in the more recent past, our modern relationship was first formalised in the early 1900s.But the strength of our current partnership isn’t just a by-product of our shared past.  The strength of our partnership is also a product of the many threads that continue to connect us today.  As well as our political, economic, cultural and social bonds, we have enduring whakapapa links; we are part of the same realm; we have a special constitutional relationship; we share the same New Zealand citizenship; and there are more than 80 000 Cook Islanders living in Aotearoa –  represented in our Parliament and here tonight are the Honourable Poto Williams, Tangi Utikere and Teanau TuionoDuring this era of COVID, we have seen just how strong the bonds between our two countries truly are.  Together we have been able to successfully navigate what COVID has thrown at us, and even seize back some normality – including through the resumption of one-way quarantine-free travel from the Cook Islands to New Zealand. But while New Zealand has been spared the level of casualties others have suffered, and the Cook Islands has been blessed to remain COVID-19 free, neither of our countries has been spared the economic and social repercussions of the pandemic. We are deeply concerned by the devastating impact COVID has had on the Cook Islands’ tourism industry - the backbone of its economy.  We know this has been a challenging time for the people of the Cook Islands, and have been impressed with the way in which the Cook Islands government has responded, including through its economic response plan.  Even so, with no clear end to COVID in sight, we are all too aware of the bleak economic outlook the Cook Islands is facing.For our part, New Zealand will continue to do all we can to support the Cook Islands. A successful vaccination rollout plan and resurgence planning helps us towards an objective of open borders and resuming tourism travel.Let me assure you Prime Minister: New Zealand remains absolutely committed to partnering with the Cook Islands to ensure our collective safety, well-being, resilience and prosperity.  After all, we are more than just neighbours. Our shared sense of whanaungatanga means that what we do together to tackle economic impacts while maintaining vigilance about the health response will have long term benefits.Over the last year, as partners, we have been primarily focused on weathering the COVID storm.  It is timely that we now look beyond COVID, and explore what more we can do to increase resilience, including that of our partnership. In the post-COVID era, We will need to call on the navigational skill sets of our tupuna as we seek out stable and reliable relationships to traverse the economic, social and environmental challenges faced.With this in mind, the theme for tonight’s keynote speech by Prime Minister Mark Brown is timely: “Beyond Covid, Enduring Relationships and Transformative Partnerships”.Before I welcome the Prime Minister to the podium, I would like to acknowledge the instrumental role he has played in keeping the Cook Islands COVID-free, and in protecting the Cook Islands from the full force of the economic impacts of the pandemic.  Before taking up his role last year as Prime Minister, he served the Cook Islands in various roles, including as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister.  During the decade he served as Finance Minister he presided over a period of unprecedented economic growth that has helped buffer the Cook Islands during these challenging times.  Now, as Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Finance, Minister of Police, Minister for Energy and Renewable Energy and in his many other distinguished roles, he has continued to serve his country and his people with dedication, skill and mana.  I look forward to hearing his remarks this evening as I know you will too.  It is now my honour to welcome our distinguished key note speaker to the podium: the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands, the Honourable Mark Brown: nau mai, haere mai.Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa.  Meitaki ma’ata e manuia.  "
2021-03-26T01:26:48Z,        Hon Jan Tinetti,"  Learning Support, Curriculum, Attendance - NZPF Moot Speech  ","Tuhia ki te rangiTuhia ki te whenuaTuhia ki te ngakau o ngā tangataKo te mea nuiKo te arohaTihei Mauri Ora!Kia tau mai te aroha Ngā manaakitanga o te AtuaKia ora koutou, Ngā mihi nui ki a koutouThanks for having me today. It’s exciting to be here with you. I was a proud NZPF member for 20 years and while I don’t want to sound like I’m glossing over just how hard being a principal is I am still maintain my time as a principal was the biggest of privileges. I’ve been to a few moots in my time in Education and I remember feeling quite…  sceptical about the things said from various Ministers at this podium when I sat where you are. So I was careful in planning what I wanted to say in this speech. To loosely quote one of my favourite, if not recently controversial philosophers, Dr Seuss - I want to say what I mean and mean what I say. Firstly I want to reiterate what Chris said earlier about the great work you’ve all done over the past year to keep young people engaged in their learning and to support your staff and communities. I am so proud of the sector. It’s been and still is a challenging time for all of you and I know the huge amount of stress you and your staff are under. I admire the leadership you’ve shown each other and support you’ve shown to our tamariki during this time. Thank you for being amazing. Your kaupapa of today – Get Set Reset – Our Future: ‘Curriculum, Teaching and Learning’ is really exciting. I’m sure we can all agree that the pandemic is a big disruption in education but most of us in this room already understand that disruption can bring opportunity. An opportunity exists now to reimagine curriculum, teaching and learning to ensure all our learners have every opportunity to experience success. Such an opportunity is exciting but means we must examine together all factors that impact upon young people experiencing this success.I’m excited about the opportunity I have, through my delegations as Associate Education Minister, at this critical point in our educational landscape. When I was thinking about this speech today I quickly realised I don’t have enough time to talk with you about everything I want to but I believe today is the start of our conversation together. Let’s start with the elephant in the room - Learning Support - and while I’m probably going to pose more questions here this morning than give answers, I want to leave you with a sense of where my priorities lie and how passionate I am about building a strong Learning Support network.When I was given my delegation of Learning Support, I had some of my former colleagues jokingly question if I’d been given a hospital pass (actually maybe there was some seriousness in there) – in fact I’m thinking some people in this room probably thought the same.This is certainly not how I feel – I wanted Learning Support – this is an area that has driven me throughout my career. I am excited with this delegation but I acknowledge it’s not easy and the road ahead is not going to be easy. Our challenges are extremely complex. Within the same system we have learners who thrive and others who don’t. I know that both you and I share the same goal of wanting all our learners to thrive and experience success. To understand the complexity of this challenge it’s important to outline the work achieved over the past three years.I want to acknowledge my predecessor Hon. Tracey Martin. Under her guidance this Government has invested $1.1Billion into learning support since 2017. We’ve broadened what we mean by Learning Support – it’s wider than just those with identified disabilities, it includes the one in five students who need some level of additional support for their learning. We’ve got our Learning Support Action Plan, and created a new workforce of 623 Learning Support Coordinators. I released an evaluation report last week that shows great results so far - it’s clear that LSCs are doing excellent work. They are adding much needed capacity and capability in their Schools and Kura. Future roll out is subject to the ongoing evaluation phase and Budget processes. It’s also useful for me to hear from you how valuable resource is to your tamariki.We’ve employed over 180 more Ministry Specialists – like occupational therapists, psychologists and Early Intervention Teachers – and there are now nearly 1000 across the country. Along with this, schools have RTLBs, PB4L, as well as the Intensive Wraparound Service, an Interim Response Fund, and the Ongoing Resourcing (ORS) for students with the highest levels of need.Despite all of this, there are still critical issues that are presenting in schools. That tells me there is a much deeper issue than resourcing. I know the trauma and stress that teachers are seeing and experiencing. I’ve had first-hand experience of this – that was my reality. There are students who have very challenging behaviours and whose situations are very complex. I hear your requests for more resourcing to meet the needs of the young people who sit within Priority 6 of the Learning Support Action plan – children and young people at risk of disengaging. The team at the Ministry are well aware that Priority area 6 is a top priority for me. They are exploring how to best develop local initiatives that support the wellbeing and educational needs of those students exhibiting behaviour that may be challenging to others. It is important, however that as well as focussing on short term solutions we also take a far more strategic position. We all know that education is initiative heavy. We see a problem we plug it with a new initiative time and time again until we get to the point where we cave. That’s why it’s important while we look at the short term we also work together in partnership to look at the medium and long term. We must also remember that this isn’t just on the shoulders of education. In many situations the underlying issues are unlikely to be addressed by schools on their own. I know many of you have reminded me Health and welfare should also be part of the conversations. We’ve seen just how powerful breaking down the silos can be through examples such as Social Workers in Schools and more recently Mana Ake in Canterbury.While your stories are powerful – I get them and understand them – I have the same stories. We have an opportunity to move beyond them with shared solutions towards a strong and sustainable system that provides the best opportunities for all our tamariki. We must together look at all parts of the system from the micro-site level to the macro-systemic level, and make fundamental shifts rather than adding another initiative to an already struggling system. The needs of our learners are changing, and so too must the system.We know attendance is a symptom or marker of a much larger picture of student engagement: improvements in behaviour and learning will contribute to improved attendance. As you will know all too well, one of the ongoing challenges we’ve been facing is declining attendance rates - Student attendance has been declining since around 2013. COVID-19 had posed additional challenges around student attendance and engagement. We all know how important it is for young people to regularly attend school. Everyday students attend school it makes a difference, because:They stay engaged in learningThey have direct contact with their teacherThey are in an environment where the focus is on their safety, wellbeing and learningIt provides an important emotional support network for them with their friends and classmates and school community. Schools, on their own, cannot address all the social and economic woes of our society. But by working together, we are much more likely to turn the attendance picture around.  Over the coming year, I intend to review the structure and performance of existing investments in student attendance services, drawing on the lessons we have already learned from the URF investments.Through the Urgent Response Fund, we have provided $50 million in 2020/21 to support children and young people who need extra help with new, locally developed solutions to the student attendance and engagement challenge.The fund is available to schools, kura and early learning services me ngā kōhanga reo to help address attendance issues, support wellbeing, cultural wellbeing and re-engagement in learning.The URF can be used for school-wide activities to support attendance and student welfare, or for individual students or groups of young people. In some schools, the fund is enabling teachers, teacher aides, principals and/or kaumatua to visit the homes of their ākonga to provide assurance around safety and support at school, and to connect to additional wellbeing support where needed.  In other examples, additional support is being provided to whānau to access the help they need from other agencies so they can overcome barriers to their children attending school. We learnt that local knowledge and priorities must underpin decisions about the use of URF funding. Regional groups of leaders are working with the Directors of Education in the Ministry's ten regions to determine how funding can best support attendance, engagement and wellbeing issues of children and young people at a local level.There are also great pilots happening in Kawerau and South Auckland which show that this regional approach is important. There is no one answer, initiative or programme to fix the issue of declining attendance rates, and get kids engaged with their learning but it is clear local knowledge and priorities must form part of the solution. Refreshing the curricula will also help, so that when children are more emotionally-regulated, they can engage with learning that is relevant, interesting, age and stage appropriate, and meaningful to them and their whānauStudents need to learn from a curriculum that is rich in te reo and tikanga Māori, that focuses on wellbeing, identities, language and culture and equips them with the skills and aptitudes they need. And parents, teachers and whānau want more certainty about what tamariki need to ‘understand, know and do’ in schools and kura, track their progress, acknowledge their strengths and where support is neededThat’s why we are refreshing the national curriculum over the next five years - so it is clearer, more relevant and easier to use. This includes both Te Marautanga o Aotearoa and The New Zealand Curriculum.During the next five years, each learning area in The New Zealand Curriculum will be refreshed ─ beginning with Aotearoa New Zealand’s histories and the Social Sciences learning area this year, followed by content for the Mathematics and Statistics, English and Science learning areas in 2022.An example can be seen in the recently announced draft curriculum content for Aotearoa New Zealand’s histories and Te Takanga o Te Wā. This year, draft content is being trialled so it is ready to be taught in schools in 2022.The important shift for Te Marautanga o Aotearoa is to address equity, trust and coherence and reflect a more authentic indigenous curriculum that is holistic and ākonga-focused, grounded in te ao Māori. The refreshed national curriculum for schooling will strike a balance between the learning that is important nationally and that which is relevant locally. This means there will be more consistency about what is taught across the country, while teachers and kaiako can also better integrate local context—so ākonga are learning from a curriculum that is meaningful to them and their whānau.Whānau, hapū and iwi are also valued as important contributors to what schools and kura need to achieve for their tamariki.Ākonga are at the heart of why we are refreshing the national curriculum. Their voice, diverse needs and aspirations will inform the refreshed curriculum, providing every opportunity for their success, now and in the future. As part of the curriculum refresh we are developing strategies and supports for literacy and mathematics. Both are foundational for success across the wider curriculum, and in work and life.  It’s clear that what we’re doing in mathematics is not working for all learners – we have persistent inequalities and a pattern of long-term decline in student performanceA priority in 2021 is also working with the sector to develop a mathematics strategy, drawing on contemporary evidence (from both research and practice), so that we can meet the unique needs of all learners including Māori, Pacific and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds.The literacy strategy will identify how we strengthen progress along the learning pathway and address literacy issues for all learners, and in particular those that are considered at-risk.We will be working closely with literacy and mathematics practitioner working groups, including principals, like yourselves and teachers, and taking a fresh look at our guidance to make sure it’s up-to date and can meet the needs of our diverse population. You will hear more about this soon, and have opportunities to provide input and advice into the strategy.  This Government is committed to reducing longstanding inequalities in education so that all children and young people – including those with greater learning support needs – can have their achievement, progress, wellbeing, and participation valued and supportedWe can’t do this without you. We know we need to support teachers and kaiako to successfully put these changes in place. This Government has invested significantly more than any government before in learning support, in developing the workforce and resourcing schools. It is clear, that if more money and more people was the only answer, things would be starting to improve. As I’ve already indicated education can sometimes feel like a Christmas tree – with all sorts of initiatives piled on, one after the other after the other. We need to review how our Curriculum, our Learning Support and Attendance Services are structured to put the learner and their needs in the centre. Because if the tree isn’t structurally sound, the tree topples over under the weight of its shiny baubles. Schools are already doing this – they already put children at the centre - but I remember how it can sometimes feel like a challenge to do so. Educators and all other New Zealanders will have the opportunity to help shape our curriculum so that all our tamariki can see themselves in their learning and get the learning they need. We know that people in our kura and schools are experiencing a lot of change as we work to improve education outcomes for all ākonga – so we are developing an extensive package of supports in collaboration with educators, including professional development, to better meet THEIR needs. We will work with school leaders like yourselves, teachers and kaiako to make sure we redesign teaching and learning in a way that better supports you to meet the needs of our ākonga. It will take strength, commitment and passion.I am passionate about education and in my heart will always consider myself to be an educator. I know there are going to be times in our ongoing conversation where we will disagree but at all times please remember that I hold you all in the highest regard – you do amazing work and I sincerely value your equal role in this partnership going forward. In those difficult times we need to remember Joan Dalton’s advice that the difficult conversations turn into the most important ones.In closing, I hold a quote by Glennon Doyle with me every day: How do I find my purpose? How do I find my people? Here’s how to find both.Figure out what breaks your heart in the world – that’s your purpose.Find the folks working to fix that thing in the world and join them - those are your people. You are my people and together we can work to improve the lives of our tamariki and rangatahi. Kia Kaha, kia māia, kia manawanuiNo reira tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātau katoa"
2021-03-25T19:59:00Z,        Hon David Parker,  Keynote Speech to the NZ Planning Institute Conference 2021,"Nelson, Friday 26th March  {The Minister spoke off-the-cuff with opening remarks reflecting on COVID-19 and the current context for the Government.}As you know on 10 February we announced our intention to transform the ways in which we plan for and with our communities. Today I will give you an update on where we are with these resource management reforms. I will also look at the other priority work programmes underway to ensure we continue to plan to supply housing, improve water quality and protect highly productive land. The Environment is under pressureThere is broad consensus that New Zealand’s resource management system introduced by the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) is no longer fit for purpose. (Although it does get unfairly blamed for some things that are not the fault of the RMA.) Ecosystems are degraded, our waterways have been in major decline, biodiversity is diminishing, and over 4,000 of our plant and animal native species are now threatened.  Urban development has struggled to keep pace with population growth.  Decisions under the RMA have entrenched amenity values ranking issues of taste too highly, holding up intensification and contributing to rapidly increasing land prices. New Zealand’s housing is now amongst the least affordable in the OECD. The need to address these problems is urgent and at the centre is work to create a resource management system that’s fit for purpose, and protects and provides for the wellbeing of future generations. A comprehensive reviewIn 2019, the Government commissioned an expert review of the resource management system led by retired Court of Appeal Judge Hon Tony Randerson QC. This was the most significant, broad ranging and inclusive review since the RMA was enacted. The review was primarily focused on the RMA, the interface of the RMA with specific legislation (Local Government Act, Land Transport Act and the Climate Change Response Act), and a new role for regional spatial planning. The review process was an opportunity to design a new system for resource management in New Zealand that delivers better outcomes for our environment, our people, our economy, and culture.The Panel’s report, New Directions for Resource Management in New Zealand, colloquially known as the Randerson Report was published in July last year and it was distributed widely. We let is sit over the election period and parties took their own positions. I am hoping all of you here today have taken the opportunity to read this comprehensive and historic report – it is only 531 pages including appendices after all! Reform of the system This is once-in-a-generation opportunity to set up the resource management system in New Zealand for the next 30 years to safeguard the wellbeing of future generations.  The Panel did a superb job, and we are using their recommendations as a platform for the reforms.     They proposed three pieces of legislation which are:   the Natural and Built Environments Act (NBA)the Strategic Planning Act (SPA)the Climate Adaptation Act (CAA)We’re expecting to see the following significant shifts: an integrated set of national direction that will help reconcile tensions between competing objectives.  This will now be called the National Planning Framework, and will include required outcomes and bottom linesstrategic long term planningstronger collaboration across local government on their core planning functions. This will see the number of resource management plans reduced from over 100 to about 14Alternative Dispute Resolution for boundary disputes in urban areas, andwe want stronger system oversight and accountabilitya clearer role for Māori in plan development The Panel proposed that any future system should give effect to the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and provide a clearer role for mana whenua in decision-making.      These changes seek a clearer focus on protecting the natural environment values, rather than non-natural amenity values, which will help enable development within environmental limits. We will continue our efforts to improve housing supply.  And we will better prepare to adapt to climate change and other natural hazards.Overall, we want the system to become more effective and efficient, thus reducing costs and time.  The Natural and Built Environments Act, which we are calling the NBA for short, will be the primary replacement for the RMA. This is the core piece of legislation providing for land use and environmental regulation. It will include a focus on the positive outcomes to be achieved for both the natural and built environments, rather than just on managing the effects of an activity or development. (That led to what has been termed the “salami effect”, where a series of individual decisions with limited effects added up to a major  impact.) We are working through how we manage this without being so inflexible that it stops necessary infrastructure.The proposed system of outcomes, limits and targets will be realised through a national planning framework which will provide a set of mandatory national policies, standards and regulations on specified aspects of the new system.  Each region will develop one single NBA plan and these will be prepared by local government in partnership with mana whenua and central government.  The national planning framework will apply to these NBA plans.There will be fewer NBA plans but they will be more directed to achieving outcomes.  NBA plans must be consistent with the natural planning framework and regional spatial strategies. NBA plans, as now, will direct which activities do and do not require consent.The Strategic Planning Act (SPA) will reduce uncertainty.  It will set strategic outcomes for how we plan to use or protect land and the coastal marine area.  Central government, local government and mana whenua will together develop long-term regional spatial strategies in each region providing pathways towards future outcomes, developing regional spatial strategies to better integrate land-use and infrastructure.  Under the SPA we will identify:areas suitable for developmentareas that need to be protected or improvedthe main new infrastructure needed and other social needs such as hospitals and schoolsareas that are vulnerable to climate change effects and natural hazards such as earthquakes. This will assist development and infrastructure to be provided in the right places at the right times.The regional strategies will set out what development capacity is needed to improve housing supply relative to population growth. These regional strategies will help integrate functions under the NBA, Local Government Act 2002, Land Transport Management Act 2003 and the Climate Change Response Act 2002 to enable clearer and more efficient decision-making and investment. They will not have details like zone rules. They are high level.  Essentially, for it to be in the SPA, it has to be able to be depicted on a map. The Climate Adaptation Act (CAA) will address the complex legal and technical issues around climate change and other natural hazards. These include addressing issues related to managed retreat from areas threatened with inundation and the funding and financing of climate change adaptation. This is being progressed by my colleague the Minister for Climate Change, James Shaw.A More Effective Role for MāoriAs mentioned, a key objective of the reform is to provide for a more effective role for Māori in the system.  We are looking to give effect to the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and stronger recognition of te ao Māori, including mātauranga Māori. Collectively the changes will represent a significant shift for the participation by Māori in the system, with the expectation that  Māori values, interests and aspirations for the environment can be realised.  We are working collaboratively with several Māori entities on the policy development for the exposure draft of the NBA legislation.  We are mindful of the impact of this reform on treaty settlements so are talking with Post Settlement Governance Entities to ensure existing commitments in settlements are carried across in an acceptable way in the new legislation. I want to acknowledge my colleague, Associate Minister for the Environment Kiritapu Allan, for the work she is undertaking on this.Local government has a key role in these reforms and the Minister for Local Government Nanaia Mahuta is involved. Elected representatives play a key role in giving the community a voice. Local government needs expertise and the technical knowledge of planning professionals turning local visions into reality. It’s critical that local communities can shape the places they live, work, and play to support their wellbeing. Regional strategies and NBA plans will have to work, both to achieve national outcomes and at the local level to ensure the planning system delivers good outcomes for all communities. Opportunities for engagement This is complex work and one of the most significant public policy processes for decades. So where exactly are we in this process? We have already begun drafting legislation based on the Randerson Report. I expect to have an early draft of key parts of the legislation – an exposure draft – ready to be referred to a select committee in the first half of this year. The draft will include the proposed purpose and principles, the Treaty clause, provisions enabling the National and Planning framework, and the National and Built Environments region-wide plans. The select committee will report back to Parliament with its findings and any changes will be made before the full NBA is formally introduced into Parliament we hope later this year. This will be put through a full select committee process.At the same time we are advancing decisions on the Strategic Planning and Climate Change Response Acts and we have set up an inter-agency board under the Public Service Commissioner to oversee the SPA. Its membership includes Environment, Housing and Urban Development, Transport,  Internal Affairs, Conservation, the Treasury, Te Arawhiti, Te Puni Kōkiri, Primary Industries, Business, Innovation and Employment, and Culture and Heritage.We aim for the NBA being passed into law in by the end of 2022 and the SPA and CAA to follow in 2023.    Transition to the new systemThe proposed new system will be different from the RMA, and its success will depend on our collective capability and capacity to implement the new system. Your commitment to make this work is central to this.We will need your input on how to make the new system work, and be willing to modify the tools and methods we use in the current system.We want to hear your views on the new system through the select committee inquiry initially and then via the full select committee process. We need to focus on system efficiency; how we can create incentives for proportionate, perhaps more iterative, processes rather than excessively complex, long and expensive ones.A lesson of the failures in RMA implementation in the 1990s is to ensure we can transition to a different system without unnecessary disruption. My officials are already working on a transition and implementation plan at the same time as we work on the policy decisions and the legislative process. The goal is to provide as much certainty as possible to local government about the transition pathway.In the meantime, we cannot delay addressing our current environment and planning challenges. Local government implementation of national direction on freshwater and urban development in my view is progressing well. Thank you. It will be transitioned into the new system. It is not a wasted effort. Housing outcomes through reformImproving housing outcomes is one of the key objectives for the reform. Healthy and affordable homes are essential to our wellbeing and sense of belonging.      Urban areas hold 86 per cent of our population and are where 99 per cent of our population growth occurs. Cities need to respond to population growth sustainably. Plans that anticipate and respond to growth and change can play a critical role in achieving our aims for housing.   Housing problems are a complex mix of demand as well as costs, financing, infrastructure, capacity and supply. You will be aware that on Tuesday we set out the Government’s far reaching plans for both demand side and supply side measures to address housing issues.  The planned reforms will also help address some of these issues. A more effective and efficient system will provide more certainty and a simpler, less costly decision-making process to support housing developments, enabling new homes to be built more quickly.  Better strategic planning will help align infrastructure investment by central and local government and the private sector to help ensure it is provided at the right place, at the right time. Infrastructure is integrated with land use planning, development and urban growth. Reform is part of the suite of actions the Government is taking, including changes to how infrastructure is financed. Our housing programme has us now building more homes than any Government since the 1970s, and the measures we announced this week will help with demand and supply. National Policy Statement on Urban DevelopmentAn important but often underrated part of our plan to meet the demand for houses is the National Policy Statement on Urban Development, which was gazetted last year.  This ensures New Zealand’s towns and cities are well-functioning urban environments that meet the changing needs of our diverse communities. It removes overly restrictive barriers to development (such as the rules requiring the provision of car parks) to allow growth both ‘up’ and ‘out’ and a focus in urban areas on locations that have good access to existing services, public transport networks and infrastructure. Officials at MfE and the Ministry for Housing and Urban Development are currently focused on supporting the implementation of this NPS and monitoring progress being made. The NPS-UD is a good example of how we are preparing the old system for transformation to the new.Essential Freshwater packageWe have work proceeding on protection of highly productive soils and biodiversity. I won’t cover those today, but I will talk about our work on freshwater.The Government’s goal for freshwater is to stop further degradation, show material improvements within five years (of 2017) and restore our waterways to health within a generation. Achieving this is complex and requires significant effort in both rural and urban areas. Our NPS and NES are now in place. Te Mana o te Wai is reinforcing a clear hierarchy to guide the management of freshwater, starting with the protection of the health and wellbeing of waterbodies, then the essential needs of people before enabling other uses of freshwater.    I recognise that considerable effort and resource is going into making these changes work in practice. The public is overwhelmingly on your side, so keep it up. I am pleased to see collaboration between regional councils divvying up some of the tasks. MfE are ready to help, as are the Freshwater Commissioners created in last year’s RMA amendment.On allocationWe indicated in our election manifesto that we will work to achieve efficient and fair allocation of freshwater resources, having regard to all interests including Māori, and existing and potential new users.Water is a valuable and strategic asset and gives us an important competitive advantage. The way we allocate freshwater will affect the prosperity of future generations. It’s got to be fair. With increasing demand, over-allocation and the challenge of climate change, the current ‘first-in, first-served’ approach allied with near automatic rollover, is no longer suitable. Working with Treaty partners and key stakeholders, we have the opportunity to make meaningful and lasting change.Expectations for PlannersFinally, I want to end by thanking NZPI for their contribution to the Randerson Review.  You have provided valuable insights and your continued participation in the development of the system is crucial. I know you will engage closely with the exposure draft of the Bill. It is important to consider how practice will need to change to support the proposals. I am interested in your views about institutional incentives which could help or hinder -- in councils, at central government and inside your own profession. Happy to take your questions.  "
2021-03-25T04:13:33Z,        Hon Willie Jackson,  Third Reading Speech – Local Government (Rating of Whenua Māori) Amendment Bill,"I move, that the Local Government (Rating of Whenua Māori) Amendment Bill now be read a third time.I was shocked, but not surprised, to find that the law relating to rating Māori land is largely unchanged since 1924. Apart from the prohibition on selling Māori land for unpaid rates, which was passed in 1968, nothing has changed in almost 100 years. Change is long overdue.So I am proud to remedy this situation and bring the rating law for Māori land into the 21st century.This Bill sits within a wider context. This Government is committed to enabling Māori landowners to develop and benefit from their land where they wish to do so.We have previously legislated to improve the operation of the Māori Land Court and have provided resources and assistance to owners to fulfill their aspirations for their land.This Bill is also an important Bill for local authorities. I was delighted that no local authority submitted against this Bill.While nationally we have been on a long journey to improve Māori Crown relations, local authorities are also walking that journey with iwi and hapū in their own communities. This Bill removes one of the obstacles to the local authorities’ journey.For too long rates have framed Māori land as a problem for local authorities, rather than an opportunity. For too long Māori attitudes to their local authority have been framed by pressures to pay rates on land from which they derive no economic benefit.This has resulted in Māori keeping their distance from local authorities, rather than engaging with local authorities to see what can be achieved in partnership with each other.The Bill removes a loophole which allows Māori land that was arbitrarily reclassified as general land in the late 1960s from being sold by local authority abandoned land or rating sales.While the number of such sales is small, they continue to this day and it is not acceptable in this era for that practice to continue.The Bill provides each local authority chief executive the power to write off rates that in his or her opinion cannot reasonably be recovered.The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has long had this power in respect of Crown taxes, but for some reason, no similar power has been available in respect of rates. The lack of this power has led to the level of rates arrears on Māori land being substantially distorted in public reports. An original debt of $1,000 becomes $3,450 before it is statute-barred for collection under the Rating Act at which point local authorities then write the debt off.Public reports of the level of rates outstanding on Māori land give a quite false impression of the amount of rates unpaid because the majority of the outstanding amount is penalties, not the rates originally assessed.Sensible use of this power by local authority chief executives can do much to improve relationships between Māori and local authorities.The Bill makes unused Māori land non-rateable. Much Māori land is inaccessible, being either entirely landlocked with no legal access at all, or with access either by sea only or by paper roads that provide no practical access.It is almost impossible for the owners of these properties to obtain any benefit from local authority services – they are effectively providing conservation estate to the nation. Making this land non-rateable is the only fair thing to do.The rates rebate scheme was designed in the 1970s to provide financial assistance to low-income homeowners. Given the Crown Māori relationship at that time, it is not surprising that it made no provision for the communal ownership of Māori land and the possibility of multiple homes being built on one block of Māori land.This has meant that many homeowners on Māori land are not able to access this assistance. However, it is not acceptable in this day and age that low-income homeowners on Māori land should be disadvantaged in accessing this entitlement. In 2018, this House recognised the special circumstances of retirement village residents when it passed the Rates Rebate (Retirement Village Residents) Amendment Act 2018.It is appropriate that having recognised the special circumstances of retirement village residents, this House also recognise the circumstances relating to homeowners on Māori land. Local authorities and Māori should stand side by side. I can think of no people who have a greater interest in the success of local authorities than those that hold mana whenua over the land in the local authorities’ districts.They are the only people that cannot and are not able to up stakes and go elsewhere if they don’t like what is happening in their community. This Bill implements a number of pragmatic measures to resolve rating issues relating to Māori land. But it also tries to clear impediments to the relationship between local authorities and Māori.In the long run, that may be its most important contribution to our future.I want to thank all those who have contributed to the preparation and passage of this Bill. I look forward to local authorities now working with Māori to successfully implement the Bill, for the benefit of Māori landowners, councils and their communities.I commend this Bill to the House."
2021-03-25T01:48:10Z,        Hon Willie Jackson,  2021 ANZSOG First Peoples conference final session speech,"Tēnā rā koutou katoa, thank you for the invitation to speak about the importance of the relationship between indigenous people and the government.This is an area I am passionate about. I’ve spent decades inside and outside the Government fighting for transitional change for Māori.An indigenous perspective is more important than ever as we keep fighting COVID-19. We must ensure indigenous peoples are on a more equitable footing through the recovery.Indigenous people are often located at the centre of issues vital to our collective wellbeingIssues like the sustainable development of our lands and waters, mitigating and adapting to climate change, and nurturing resilient generations of people who hold the tools for leading better lives.Aotearoa New Zealand is guided in this mission by Te Tiriti o Waitangi, the treaty signed between Māori and the British Crown in 1840. While it has not always been used in the way it was intended, it is a founding document that sets the base for partnership here in Aotearoa (New Zealand).As a country, we announced our support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2010. The rights in the Declaration align with the guarantee of tino rangatiratanga or self-determination to Māori under the Treaty.Our government intends to uphold the promises of the Treaty and this means restoring some of the balance between Māori and the Crown.In 2018, we established the Office of Māori Crown Relations: Te Arawhiti. This agency is focused on rethinking the future relationship between Māori and the Crown. We have made progress on our Treaty settlement process, providing a forum to recognise the Crown’s historical breaches of the Treaty. We are participating actively in a programme of kaupapa inquiries led by the Waitangi Tribunal. Investigating contemporary issues like Mana Wāhine – the customary roles and relationships of Māori women to their whenua, whakapapa and mātauranga.  We continue to work on reforms balancing the need for appropriate protections with opportunities for sustainable development.Such as the legislation governing Māori land (Te Ture Whenua Māori) and the RMA.A recent example of this is a bill passed to remove inequitable barriers to the establishment of Māori Wards on councils. Dedicated Māori seats that enable the establishment of Māori seats in local government bodies are strong features of our democracy and reflect the partnership on which our nation has been built.It is absolutely paramount we have Māori leadership advocating for Māori in decision-making realms like local government. This is something I’ve been fighting for 20 years and I’m proud of Minister Mahuta and the work she’s done to get this bill across the line.Iwi response and collaboration for pandemicWhen we think about indigenous leadership and self-determination – I must talk about the resolute action we continue to see during the pandemic.The immediate response to COVID-19 reinforced the importance of collaboration and coordination between Government and Māori.  Māori organisations develop locally tailored solutions to assist the vulnerable within their communities.Many tribal organisations help provide funding for these initiatives.For example, Te Rōpū Whakakaupapa Urutā, the National Māori Pandemic Group.It was independently formed by Māori medical and health experts including primary care specialists, public health experts, public health physicians, Māori nurses and iwi leaders. The group provided Māori (including Māori health practitioners) with access to tailored and relevant information, resources and practical guidance and advice on how to manage the pandemic.In Auckland, our largest city, we have been put through our paces four times now with the current alert level.But we continue to use those existing relationships and networks to deliver to those that need it.Together we were, and are, able to work quickly and innovatively to look after our communities. A Declaration plan for our indigenous peoplesAs the ANZSOG has rightly identified, strengthening Indigenous leadership and cultural competency in the public sector is critical in lifting the quality of public sector leadership in Australia and New Zealand. One of the ways we are going to strengthen the partnership between Māori and the government is developing a plan to measure our progress in addressing indigenous rights and interests under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  This must be done through ongoing and meaningful dialogue with iwi, hapū, whānau and wider Māori communities.The government’s priorities around economic recovery, responding to climate change, reducing child poverty and improving access to affordable housing will support improvements in the environment in which Māori can pursue their aspirations.We are seeing more examples of partnership across these spaces that are indigenous-led, regionally supported and government enabled. This is a very exciting path for our country. Our Declaration and evolving relationship will need to reflect the partnership between the Government and Māori.There needs to be a focus on supporting the wellbeing of indigenous populations and present a clear path towards the realisation of their self-determination.I want to do this right and take the time needed to ensure the process is consistent with best practice under the Declaration and the Treaty of Waitangi. We will strengthen Crown/Māori relations and partner with iwi, hapū and Māori to find appropriate solutions that will benefit all of Aotearoa.END"
2021-03-25T01:18:22Z,        Hon Jan Tinetti,  Learning Support Coordinators forum - Speech,"Tēnā koutou tēnā koutou katoaI’m delighted to be speaking with you about a subject that is so close to all our hearts – strengthening supports in schools and kura for the one in five children and young people who need additional support to learn.I was looking through the list of participants this morning and see that you cover one end of the country to the other. This is important work, and has been a driving force for me throughout my education and parliamentary careers. As a teacher and primary school principal for 27 years, I appreciate the expertise and experience you bring to these roles.I know first-hand how invaluable it is, having you working collaboratively to identify the students who need the additional support and to help connect them, their whānau and teachers with what they need.All of us know some young people who have perhaps more moderate learning support needs – and neurodiverse and gifted children too – who may not have received the help they need in the past. The experience that we all have had in our classrooms shows us how important your work is to help these children to succeed. It’s now been just over a year since the first Learning Support Coordinators – a new dedicated, fully-released role for experienced teachers - started work in 1,052 individual schools and kura around the country, grouped in 124 clusters, serving 300,000 of our learners.Last week, I was very happy to have the opportunity to meet last week the team of LSCs for the Newlands Community of Learning near Wellington.I was visiting Newlands Intermediate to learn more about what you do on the ground to help students and whānau, and teaching staff.That team is doing great work across the Intermediate, Newlands College, and local primary schools. One of the things they are concentrating on is really helping students to transition smoothly between schools. The five LSCs across the community have also run workshops to upskill teacher aides.And the school also kindly hosted an event at which I released a report on the initial evaluation of LSCs – which shows implementation has got off to a great start.Before I talk about the evaluation, I want to acknowledge my predecessor – Hon Tracey Martin – for ensuring a strong evaluation phase in the setup of LSCs, which is ensuring the job description is fit for purpose. But also, I want to thank all of you for being part of this evolution in how we provide learning support - it’s clear that LSCs are doing excellent work to assist the one in five students who need some level of additional support for their learning. The Evaluation Report shows LSCs are off to a strong start. LSCs are working in dedicated roles in schools and kura, coordinating a team of school leaders, teachers in the classroom, whānau and other learning support staff to better assist ākonga with learning support needs. We’re seeing positive benefits for teachers, students and whānau, and this evaluation means we can continuously improve the role and we can fine-tune how we assist students with learning support needs. The findings show LSCs are proving effective in working with whānau as a ‘bridge’ between home and school. This is something I am particularly passionate about. Parents appreciate being able to talk to you – rather than having to have individual relationships with every one of their children’s teachers. It is just so valuable. We have consistently heard that parents, educators and whānau place a high priority on having a dedicated learning support role in schools, and the evaluation shows how important the team approach in learning support is.The first tranche of LSCs are an “extra helpful person” - adding much needed capacity and capability within their schools, kura, and across communities – including better engaging with learning support services such as Resource Teachers: Learning and Behaviour (RTLB).You are helping schools and kura to support all students with learning support needs – not just those with the highest and most pressing needs.And I know many teachers in the classroom – especially those beginning their careers – will be gaining excellent skills and confidence from your guidance. This is an aspect of the evaluation that excited me the most. Often we forget that teacher training includes the first two years in the classroom. Many starting out feel overwhelmed and under-prepared to deliver the best for their students who require learning support. You are helping to build their confidence and capacity – thank you. Overall, it’s clear you are really filling that gap that was clearly identified through the 2016 Select Committee enquiry to improve identification and support for children and young people with dyslexia, dyspraxia, and autism.This report is the first of three evaluation phases – so we can get a full picture of how the role is going, and how we can help you to make refinements as needed. For example, we can see from the feedback that working in one school is much simpler than working across multiple schools. After all, the LSC role is so dependent on relationships, which can be more challenging when working across multiple schools where there may be differing ideas about the scope of the role.Equally most of you work alongside a SENCO and schools and clusters need to consider how the two roles can best complement each other in a team approach that meets local needs. I know this is an area that is still developing – but I was excited to hear the SENCO at Newlands Intermediate tell me last week that the LSCs are allowing her to work with low and moderate needs children for the first time ever – something I could only have imagined and dreamed of for my SENCO.RTLB staff’s understanding of the LSC role varies – but they see your ability to work with families and whānau as a real improvement in what the system has offered in the past.The next phase of the evaluation will draw on the perspectives of an even broader range of stakeholders, including more whānau voice.As you know, the Learning Support Action Plan is the roadmap to 2025 for how we will be improving the provision of learning support for our tamariki.And getting LSCs working in schools is the first of the six priorities that we’ve started with. The other priorities have also progressed. For example, last year all LSCs, and all schools in New Zealand, received a kete of resources to help identify and support learners with dyslexic-type traits. We are developing other tools and flexible supports for neurodiverse learners, as well as looking at how we can strengthen early intervention so that children’s learning needs are identified early and promptly responded to.Opportunities for gifted learners to extend and challenge their learning and support their wellbeing have already been developed – like the Awards for Gifted Learners and other events and opportunities outside the classroom. This will continue to evolve over time. We’re also taking a closer look at how to improve supports for those at risk of disengaging – it’s vital we assist our young people to stay engaged or to re-engage.As the Learning Support Action Plan continues, I am confident we will see continued progress towards better learning outcomes for all children and young people, particularly those who have additional learning support needs.Looking ahead I can see there’s potential to develop the LSC role further. We are doing this carefully, and deliberately taking a phased approach to rolling out coordinators across schools. This is why the evaluation phase is so important. It’s important we get this right. We’ve inherited a significant teacher shortage, and planning for the second phase will be worked through as a clearer picture emerges of medium and long term workforce needs.As LSCs you are uniquely placed to understand what and where the needs are and to work with teachers across your cluster to plan inclusive practices and systems for all learners, as well as targeted and individualised supports. And it’s worth remembering your efforts are being complemented, and indeed are a part of, other major education work programmes underway - including those driving improvements for Māori and Pacific learners.We’ve released strategies that set the direction on how we will achieve our 30-year vision for an education system that values the culture, identity and language of Māori and Pacific learners. These are Ka Hikitia, Tau Mai Te Reo; and the Action Plan for Pacific Education. The good news is 70 percent of respondents from schools reported strong confidence in your abilities to respond to the cultural needs of Māori and Pacific learners. So, well done!We’re looking at how the LSC works best in the Kura Kaupapa Māori and other Māori-medium settings. The roles for some LSCs are being adapted organically in kura to suit local needs.  This is the benefit of getting feedback early in the implementation – we can make the changes necessary to ensure future success. I applaud those of you who have taken part in the on-line network that’s been developed to support your PLD and enable you to keep updated and network with your colleagues.Hundreds of you have used the Learning Support Toolkit or registered to take advantage of the Network of Expertise launched last year. This is where you will get the latest information about new resources and developments in the learning support space. And the Ministry’s regional offices will continue to hold local meetings and workshops with clusters and learning support communities to further strengthen networks and induct any new LSCs. Please keep using this network, these resources and contacts at the offices to talk with each other and to share your experiences and expertise.We’ve come a long way since the days when children with “special education” needs were denied access to our schools.LSCs are at the forefront of helping to fulfil our vision - that we all share - for an inclusive education system where every child feels a sense of belonging, and where they are engaged – and making real progress.  You may have read the article about the history of learning support in the 100th anniversary edition of the Education Gazette out recentlyOne of the leaders of the Manurewa Kāhui Ako - the Principal of Manurewa Intermediate School and a good friend - Iain Taylor, is quoted in this article saying the Learning Support Delivery Model is “proving transformational – particularly the support provided by you, as LSCs.”“Transformational,” he says, “in helping our young learners achieve and reach their full potential. I couldn’t agree more.”Iain and I don’t always agree on everything, but on this count I couldn’t agree more. So, on that note, I say keep up this great work! I wish you all the very best with your role in our continued progress towards better learning outcomes for all young people, particularly those who have additional learning support needs.You’re doing an incredible job, keep it up!No reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tatou katoa."
2021-03-24T03:43:00Z,        Hon Dr Ayesha Verrall,  Speech - ASID Annual Scientific Meeting ,"IntroductionKia ora koutou katoa. Thank you Professor Rhonda Stuart & Professor Tania Sorrell for the kind introduction and thank you to ASID for the invitation to speak today. It is an honour to speak alongside so many knowledgeable and dedicated colleagues, including Dr Fauci and Professor Sutton, who have both demonstrated effective and consistent leadership throughout the pandemic. I would like to acknowledge the great work that ASID does and has done in Australia and New Zealand over the 45 years since it was founded.  ASID members have been at the forefront of the COVID-19 responses in Australia and New Zealand, as hospital specialists, infection control practitioners, clinical trial scientists and experts informing policy on public health measures and vaccines. BackgroundAs many of you will know, until my election to the New Zealand Parliament late last year and my appointment as Associate Minister of Health, I was an infectious diseases physician in Wellington, and clinical epidemiologist. I wish we were meeting in person, as there are many friends and former colleagues to catch up with. I was a registrar at Capital and Coast District Health Board in Wellington, where Doctors Tim Blackmore and Nigel Raymond inspired me to train in infectious diseases.I was also fortunate to do my fellowship at the National University of Singapore, studying under Professor Dale Fisher, Professor Paul Tambayh and Associate Professor Sophia Archuleta. Training of the next generation of physicians is really important. I’m so grateful to those that trained, encouraged and challenged me. As a trainee I was also grateful for those seniors who shared how they got to where they were. After my fellowship, I undertook a study of tuberculosis case contacts in Bandung, Indonesia. I sought to understand why some contacts remain persistently uninfected despite prolonged and intense exposure to tuberculosis. To do this a team of nurses identified x-ray and smear positive cases at community clinics and I got consent to visit their homes to recruit their contacts. M. tuberculosis isolates from the cases were cultured. Contacts were assessed for M. tuberculosis infection by interferon gamma release assay performed at baseline and 14 weeks. Contacts’ exposure to the case was quantified by sleep proximity to the case, hours spent at with the case, smear grade of the case and the presence of cavities.Like other investigators using IGRA we found BCG vaccination was protective against M. tuberculosis infection (45% reduction), and that the strength of that association was dose dependant. For contacts exposed to the lowest dose of M. tuberculosis BCG was associated with the highest protection against infection, whereas those exposed to the highest dose, BCG was not as protective. We also found a significant interaction with BCG protection and M. tuberculosis genotype. In other words, BCG protection was not significant when a contact was exposed to a Beijing strain of M. tuberculosis but was when exposed to any other strain (mostly lineage 4). In brief this and other studies supports the hypothesis that the Beijing strain of M. tuberculosis has evolved in East Asia to evade BCG.I’ll come back to the specifics of vaccine escape mutants later, but for now it is enough to say that, as with every PhD journey, what ends up in your thesis is only half of your experience. In Indonesia I learnt to manage a high-quality contact tracing operation. I needed to manage linked case and contact data, and for my analysis I needed to grasp the relationships between variables that influenced transmission. As it turns out this proved to be very useful. Pandemic recap summaryThe COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented, and while each country is working to its own strategy and goal, it is heartening to see scientific and health co-operation on COVID - and more - between Australia and New Zealand. The scientific progress we have made is a credit to the collaborative efforts from all involved. Today, I will talk about New Zealand’s COVID-19 response from my perspective as an Associate Minister for Health. I’ll talk you through the development of our elimination strategy and highlight some of the scientific contributions New Zealanders have made. Events and early pandemicWhile I wasn’t part of the Government early last year, I know New Zealand’s response was based on science. However, science alone was not enough. Science couldn’t answer the question, “how important are the lives of our sick or our seniors?” That is a question of values. Science can’t predict, “will people stay home if the Government asks them to?” That is a question of leadership. And ultimately, the collective will of the community. It’s worth bearing this in mind as we go over the timeline of events. It was a year ago yesterday that the Prime Minister of New Zealand announced that the entire country would be moving into ‘Alert Level Four’ - lockdown - where we would stay for more than a month in an attempt to eliminate COVID-19.This report by Sarah Jefferies and colleagues at our surveillance centre ESR details our early response to the pandemic. This is a graph of cases over time, with the background shading representing the intensity of social distancing measures.We introduced travel restrictions for foreign nationals coming to New Zealand from Wuhan at midnight on 2 February. We recommended self-isolation for 14 days for anyone travelling from mainland China, and encouraged these returnees to voluntarily register through the telehealth service “Healthline”. We developed the capacity for diagnostic testing on February 2 and our first case was confirmed on February 28. That same day, we placed temporary border restrictions on incoming travellers from Iran, which was at that time experiencing high case numbers.On 4 March, we confirmed our second COVID-19 case – this time a woman in her 30s who had returned to New Zealand from Italy. Our border grew progressively tighter as the pandemic spread internationally, with travel restrictions extending to Italy and South Korea.  From 14 March, everyone entering New Zealand from anywhere in the world, excluding the Pacific Islands, had to self-isolate for 14 days. On 17 March, the Government announced a $12.1 billion business continuity package and two days later, we closed our border to all travellers except New Zealand citizens and residents. New Zealanders were advised to not travel overseas. This slide shows international passenger arrivals falling away following escalating travel restrictions from February through to May. This border closure remains in place today.Social distancing and the alert level system.Origins of the alert level systemA crucial part of our COVID response has been our alert levels. These levels represent increasingly stringent social distancing measures.   We sought an easy to understand framework, as we had seen developed in Singapore. This was to help people understand the current level of risk and the restrictions that legally must be followed. However, we designed it for an elimination approach. The goal of social distancing measures is not merely to reduce the R0 to <1, but to keep it there and extinguish transmission. Alert level 4 – Lockdown (likely the disease is not contained). People are instructed to stay home in their bubble for all but essential movements. Non-essential movements outside the home are limited (e.g. for exercise once a day and must be local). Alert level 3 – Restrict (high risk the disease is not contained). Parts of the economy are open such as construction and primary production, but retail and hospitality are not. Alert level 2 – Reduce (the disease is contained, but the risk of community transmission remains). People are allowed to move outside their bubble, working from home is encouraged and gatherings can be up to 100 people. Alert level 1 – Prepare (the disease is contained in New Zealand) but hygiene measures including masks on public transport and completion of contact tracing registers (manually or digitally) is required. As part of lockdown, the ‘bubble’ proved to be a powerful concept that resonated well with New Zealanders.  ‘Stay in your bubble, don’t burst your bubble’ was a positive way of framing what the team of 5 million Kiwis needed to do to keep themselves, their families and their community safe from COVID-19 and it worked. We introduced our alert levels to the New Zealand public on 21 March with a move to ‘Alert Level 2’. On 23 March 2020, New Zealand committed to an elimination strategy in response to the pandemic. It was determined that the only way to control the pandemic was to move to Alert Level 4.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that on 26 March, NZ would commence an intense lockdown of the country (Alert Level 4). Our lockdown was among the most stringent in the world, with close to 60% reduction in movement measured by cell phone tower data collected by Statistics NZ.At the time, NZ had just over 100 COVID‐19 cases and no deaths so this approach surprised many. However, there were compelling reasons for NZ to pursue elimination.In addition to widespread mortality and hospitalisations, we feared the impacts would be greater on Māori and Pacific communities, as in previous pandemics. Whatsmore we wished to avoid exporting COVID to neighbouring Pacific countries, as had recently happened during a measles outbreak. Our nation would stay in lockdown for almost 5 weeks. Development of the Elimination Strategy Until early March 2020, the NZ response to COVID‐19 followed the existing pandemic plan, which was based on a mitigation approach for managing pandemic influenza.  The plan had four key phases: keep it out (border controls), stamp it out (through case based measures like isolation and contact tracing) and manage it (through social distancing to minimize the impact on health services) and recovery. These were intended to be applied sequentially. By early March the evidence base for elimination was growing, with the increasing realisation that COVID‐19 was markedly different to pandemic influenza in terms of its transmission dynamics.Early reports found COVID-19 has a longer incubation period than influenza. The report of the WHO joint mission to China also suggested asymptomatic transmission was less frequent than for influenza. Both these observations suggest case isolation and contact tracing measures were likely to be more effective against COVID-19 than influenza. Consistent with this, at the population level, the WHO report also confirmed that an outbreak can be contained even after widespread community transmission had commenced. Again, this contrasts with influenza where community transmission cannot be contained and the response needs to rapidly change to mitigation. Indeed that was our experience with H1N1 influenza.These observations, and the early success of the elimination approach in Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea supported the feasibility of an elimination strategy. Countries pursuing an elimination strategy use similar tools to those pursuing a mitigation or suppression strategy, but they differ in terms of their intensity and timing. This table, from a paper I wrote with Infectious Diseases Epidemiologist Michael Baker and others sets out the key differences. Specifically, very strong border management keeps the virus out, intensive and rapid case contact management stamps out transmission, and intensive surveillance must be performed to identify cases. An elimination approach also applies physical distancing or lockdowns early to extinguish community transmission. Whereas a suppression approach keeps them in reserve to “flatten the curve” when health systems are threatened. Our Prime Minister explained this strategy to New Zealanders in a manner fit for a nation of sports enthusiasts as “going hard and early”.  Operationalising the Elimination Strategy Of course, a theoretical framework is one thing, operationalising it required extensive work to strengthen our response. In the next section I want to give credit to the monumental work done by officials in the public sector and health professionals to operationalise the elimination strategy. We have set up quarantine facilities when we had none, established a multifaceted surveillance system and developed a system of rapid case and contact management. I will discuss these in turn. Border controlsNew Zealand’s borders are, with a few exceptions, closed to overseas visitors, and a quarantine system has been developed to accommodate New Zealanders returning from overseas. Or in public health terms our interventions at the border are both exclusion and quarantine.  Since 9 April 2020, we have required all new arrivals into New Zealand to go into quarantine or isolation in an approved facility, usually a hotel, for a minimum of 14 days. That continues today.During their stay, people are subject to daily health and wellbeing checks and at least 3 tests – a negative result from the final test (taken on around day 11/12 of their stay) is one of the requirements for exit. While in quarantine and isolation facilities, people have access to a full range of clinical and psycho-social support. Unlike comparative models of border quarantine overseas, to support the mental wellbeing of guests, our model allows for guests to leave their hotel room for outdoor exercise and/or smoking under supervision and adherence to infection prevention and control measures. For those coming from ‘high risk’ countries, this is only permitted following receipt of a negative day 0/1 test result.As hospital doctors you will know preventing COVID-19 transmission in purpose built facilities is hard enough. Doing so in hotels staffed by a mix of health care and other workers is even harder. We have had a suite of infection control measures and audit cycle in isolation and quarantine facilities, but specific measures have had to change as our understanding of SARS-CoV2 transmission has evolved. Transmission in quarantine or isolation facilitiesHowever, instances of in facility transmission have occurred as documented in this report by Dr Nick Eichler and others.On September 18 case G, a recent arrival from India was identified. He was part of a cohort of 149 NZ citizens or permanent residents returning from India on August 27, of these 8 showed positive results in quarantine. Three were gnomically linked (cases A, B, and C) – all sat within 2 rows of each other on their flight. Case C’s onset of symptoms was consistent with infection during this flight, from either case A or B.Case C tested positive on day 12 of their quarantine and was relocated to an isolation facility. Before their relocation an adult and child were in the adjacent room (case D and E) who had also arrived on the same flight from India. Both were negative on routine day 3 and 12 tests, but later tested positive in the community, consistent with infection in the quarantine facility.Review of hotel closed circuit TV footage shows there were no instances where the three people were outside their room at the same time. But, when day 12 testing was performed in the doorway of the hotel rooms there was a 50 second period between the closing of the door to patient C and the opening of the door to case D and E. The authors hypothesize that suspended aerosol particles were probably the mode of transmission. A review of the ventilation system found that the rooms in question had a net positive pressure relative to the corridor.  Following completion of their 14 days quarantine cases D and E travelled with case G on a domestic chartered flight from Christchurch to Auckland. Case G sat directly in front of case D and E. There was also onwards transmission to their household contacts. Measures to prevent aerosol spread in quarantine and isolation facilities.All community cases are investigated in this level of detail, including with WGS, so that lessons can be learnt and improvements implemented across the system. We have implemented a range of measures to prevent aerosol spread of covid-19 in quarantine and isolation facilities in response to cases like this, and the increasing international evidence regarding the aerosolisation of SARS-CoV-2. These include:Requiring the use of N95/P2 particulate respirators by staff for specific activities and during close interactions with hotel guests (irrespective of COVID status). This is contrary to international IPC guidelines but we justify it on the basis of the poor ventilation of hotels relative to purpose built facilities. We have assessed the ventilation systems of the hotels to identify potential risks for aerosol transmission and implement practical remediation to improve air flow. This includes deploying portable HEPA filtration units for use in poorly ventilated, shared indoor spaces within the facilities, such as corridors and lifts.Since April 2020, the isolation and quarantine system has housed 125,128 people, identified 759 imported cases of COVID-19 and 7 instances of COVID-19 transmission in isolation or quarantine facilities. The robust IPC measures in place in isolation and quarantine facilities has been critical to their success in largely preventing cross-infection within the facility, as well as instances of transmission to staff.  Surveillance and testingSurveillance strategySurveillance for community COVID-19 cases has been an essential part of NZ’s elimination strategy from the beginning. After all, cases can’t be isolated nor contacts traced unless the cases are identified. Consistent with this, countries with an elimination strategy have a low test positivity rate. We’re looking for a needle in a haystack. Whereas rapid tests may have public health impact in high transmission settings, in elimination context highly sensitive tests are required. That’s why nasopharyngeal swabs is the only sample type used for community surveillance in NZ. I wrote this paper with colleagues Nick Wilson and others. In it we model the rate of community testing required to detect SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community. We suggest a rate of approximately 5,500 tests per day. This has proved very hard to achieve because people are less likely to present for testing between outbreaks. Instead our surveillance system routinely tests people in managed isolation and quarantine staff in these facilities or other border facing roles. We encourage community testing at all times, but in practice when community cases are detected testing surges. Pragmatically we support ramping up testing through targeted communications, pop-up community testing facilities and a laboratory network in which 14 laboratories have a combined surge capacity of 32,000 tests per day. During the recent Papatoetoe cluster 90,362 tests were performed in Auckland consistent with 5% of the resident population being tested in 28 days. Our network of clinical laboratories have proven themselves to be agile and willing to come together nationally. Clinicians, scientists and operational teams have collaborated locally and nationally to build resilience into the system. This involved using different platforms and reagents, optimising use of existing resources, redeploying and training staff, reorganising teams and rosters, extending hours of work, and using other laboratories to undertake testing. Wastewater Testing In overseas jurisdictions the amount of viral RNA in a wastewater sample provides an accurate proxy of the disease burden within a catchment. Screening wastewater has, in some cases, provided advanced warning of COVID-19 in the community. The method has been successfully trialled at 18 locations across New Zealand. The primary strength of wastewater lies in the fact that samples can be collected that are representative of a large number of people.The key limitations of wastewater is the lack of certainty around the sensitivity of detection (thought to be 1-10 people in a population of ~100,000) and the fact that historical cases can trigger a positive PCR result. The former factor is an important limitation from the perspective of an elimination strategy, where test sensitivity is key. We have recently used wastewater testing in response to two community outbreaks, where it provides some level of assurance that there are not a large number of unidentified cases.We continue to work on how waste water testing might be incorporated into our strategy. Currently we plan to use it routinely in 18 housing communities near ports or quarantine facilities through-out the country. It maybe that we use waste water testing more when borders open (without quarantine). Here the fact that waste water testing can be performed independent of community testing behaviour may be an advantage. Case Management and Contact TracingWhen New Zealand went in to lockdown our contact tracing capacity was 10 cases per day. Contact tracing and other communicable disease functions are heavily devolved to 12 public health units. Lead by public health medicine specialists who are designated medical officers of health in the Health Act. While we enjoy strong professional relationships between practitioners and Government, formal accountabilities were poorly defined. The system was highly fragmented and processes were not consistent or interoperable. Resources were limited meaning, for example, DOTs couldn’t be provided to all tuberculosis patients pre pandemic.  I was asked to perform a rapid audit of NZ’s contact tracing system in April.I drew on a couple of important experiences in my training to perform that report. I had learnt a structured approach to performing rapid reviews of health systems during outbreaks when Prof Dale Fisher sent me on the GOARN training. I also returned to a conceptual model of contact tracing I developed during my studies on tuberculosis case contacts in Indonesia. Essentially contact tracing is a clinical pathway – it begins with a symptomatic case who must present for testing, be tested, have a positive test reported to public health authorities, their contacts identified and isolated. Conceptualised this way we see, firstly, that contact tracing needs to be viewed as an ‘end to end process’. Timeliness of contact tracing will always depend on timeliness of self-referral for testing and laboratory turnaround times, as well as public health system performance. Secondly, modelling studies tell us that contact tracing needs to be fast and complete to achieve R0<1.  This means that each step must be performed quickly and with a high degree of completion. The progress of each contact through the clinical pathway can be traced through a cloud hosted client relationship management software package called the national contact tracing solution. This forms the backbone of our data management system and it allows the development of key performance indicators to track performance, and identify where system improvement is required. I recommended this platform was extended to every PHU, enabling contact tracing across geographic regions, but more importantly, also connecting a national public health workforce that provides surge capacity for local outbreaks.This replaced the 12 different information systems used in each public health unit with a single national system. Clarity on the underlying process assists us in developing common SOPs for public health units across the country. However there are other aspects of contact tracing it doesn’t capture. Good contact tracing must also be acceptable to the community, integrate disease control and welfare objectives and be equitable in its outcomes. We have also elevated the role of the Ministry of Health in formally co-ordinating the outbreak response.Change towards a “preparedness” mind-set that focuses on building capacity, stress testing and planning for particular scenarios. Digital contact tracing for smartphone users has also been implemented through both Bluetooth and QR code scanning at public venues.The improvements in our contact tracing system over time can be illustrated by this slide. In August 2020 a cool store outbreak in South Auckland led to 179 cases with 2643 close contacts traced, 60% within 48 hours. In February 2021 for 15 cases we traced over 6000 contacts i.e. 400 contacts per case, although this included many casual contacts. Nonetheless 88% were isolated within 48 hours. COVID-19 VaccinesPurchasing StrategyWe have pre-ordered four different vaccine candidates for New Zealand and most recently have purchased full population coverage of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.We chose to make Pfizer our primary vaccine for its high efficacy, and because using a single vaccine would be equitable and easier logistically. Sequencing FrameworkThe sequencing framework is a targeted roll-out plan. As recommended for countries with low transmission we aim to minimize the risk of future transmission and protect the most vulnerable. The sequencing framework has four key groups:Group 1: consists of border and MIQ workers, their household contacts and people they live with. This group is approximately 50,000 people and we expect most people in this group to receive their first dose by the end of March.Group 2: includes approximately 480,000 frontline workers and people living in high-risk settings. This group started receiving vaccinations in February and will continue through to May.Group 3: is made up of priority populations of people who are at higher risk if they catch COVID-19: seniors and those with underlying conditions. This group includes approximately 1.7 million people and is planned to start in May.Group 4: includes the remaining population, which is approximately 2 million New Zealanders. Vaccinations for this group are planned to start from July.Constrained vaccine supply and the need to develop all the delivery logistics mean our vaccination rate increases gradually across the year. How the COVID-19 vaccination programme will leave a legacy for the future The COVID-19 immunisation programme is being designed to leave a legacy that is bigger than just the response to COVID-19.A COVID-19 Immunisation Register (CIR) has been created, which is the authoritative source for information on every COVID-19 vaccination. Over time, the register will be built upon to become the new National Immunisation Solution so that it has the ability to track and support delivery of other vaccinations in New Zealand, beyond COVID-19. The programme will also enable health consumers to view their own vaccine records and information.The future of the Elimination StrategyCompared to countries with large outbreaks, New Zealand and Australia face a tricky set of questions about reopening after the vaccination campaign. One of the most challenging questions is how and when we open our borders. To do so safely we need a vaccine that blocks transmission, and vaccine coverage above the herd immunity threshold. I’m encouraged by reports that show the Pfizer vaccine to have similar efficacy against infection as disease. We haven’t set a coverage target in New Zealand but are pursuing a number of related questions with modellers. What worries me is the possibility of vaccine escape mutants. As I mentioned BCG has probably selected for the Beijing strain that evades BCG protection. This could be because BCG induced immunity is only partially protective, non-sterilising, as I found, overcome by high exposure to M. tuberculosis. One might also expect that escape mutants would be more likely when transmission intensity is high, as is the case for pandemic diseases, and in contrast with the endemic diseases prevented by vaccines we routinely use. In any case they pose a challenge. What occupies me now is how we maintain a surveillance system that will detect them in a timely way. This raises the question what our ongoing public health controls should be, given we may need to reactivate them following reopening of our borders. What the threat of new variants should remind us is the adage that nobody is safe until everyone is safe. We must continue efforts to assist in global control of the pandemic. That’s why New Zealand, like Australia, participates in the COVAX facility and is purchasing enough vaccines across for full eligible population coverage of six Polynesian countries.Strengthening Public Health CapacityLooking ahead I want to ensure New Zealand has the public health capacity to continue to respond to this pandemic, and the next one. New Zealand went into this pandemic poorly prepared – we scored 30 out of 60 high income countries in the Global Health and Security index.   COVID-19 comes on top of long-standing under-resourcing, fragmentation and health inequities across the public health system.While responding to the pandemic Public Health Units have been strengthened to enhance leadership and coordination, local relationships and coordination of public health intelligence. They have also stepped up processes for incorporating scientific and community voices into strategy and policy and considering equity in their response. The process of building meaningful relationships between the Ministry of Health, iwi and other communities is critical and requires our ongoing effort. I am leading the development of a national public health service that includes improving system leadership and coordination. This includes strengthening the relationship with the 12 PHUs A national public health service will have a critical mass of technical, operational and policy expertise to lead health protection, promotion and prevention.Conclusion At the peak of the initial outbreak, we had 90 cases in one day. But our rate fell quickly after the first two weeks in lockdown.So far, New Zealand has among the world’s lowest rate of cases and deaths. Our strong public health response has also enabled a strong economic recovery. Science and strong leadership have been at the heart of the New Zealand response.  The delivery of clear, open, empathetic communication assisted with a high level of cooperation – people understood the ‘why’ and ‘how’, not just the ‘what’ – stay home, save lives, be kind.Decisions strongly informed by epidemiology, infectious disease and immunology expertise from across the science sector and implemented at pace have meant that New Zealand’s response to the pandemic resulted in a much lower impact on the country and the initial elimination of COVID-19.Every step of the way, the New Zealand Government has put science at the front and centre of the decision-making process. Whether it’s our border management, the design and operation of our managed isolation and quarantine facilities, guidance and requirements in relation to the use of PPE, or the nature and extent of restrictions on personal movement and business operations.I’d like to thank all the scientists listening today and the rest of the medical community for all the research you’ve carried out over the last 14 months and your ongoing commitment to building our understanding of the virus and how it spreads. I can assure you the New Zealand Ministry of Health closely monitors the work you’re doing and I trust you see this reflected every day in our public health response.Thank you so much for helping us keep our people safe."
2021-03-23T19:10:00Z,        Hon Andrew Little,  The case for change in the health system - building a stronger Health and Disability System that delivers for all New Zealanders,"Morena ki a tatau,Tena tatau i nga kaupapa hauora,E tuitui nei i a tatau i tēnei ata,Ka nui te mihi ki a koutou katoa.When we were re-elected with a clear mandate for change, our Government made three promises:To keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19To accelerate our economic recoveryTo lay the foundations for a better futureHealth is critical to all three of these.We all recognise the world-leading response to COVID-19, which has made New Zealand the envy of many.  The success we have had to date has been built on the dedication and professionalism of the health service.Our publicly-funded health system is one of New Zealand’s greatest assets.  It not only drives people’s health and wellbeing, but it is also our largest employer, and therefore a source of human capital and a major contributor to local economies.The health system touches all of our lives.  Every two seconds one of us sees a GP or nurse, and each year there are around 1.2 million hospitalisations, carried out in over 150 public and private hospitals, by some of the 220,000 people working in the sector.But we know that our system is under serious stress and does not deliver equally for all.It was in that context that this Government set up the Health and Disability System Review nearly three years ago. The aim of that review was to develop options to reform the system to address two major challenges: equity and sustainability.We have been working since the election to take the Review’s analysis and develop a proposal for the future to improve how we deliver healthcare so more New Zealanders get the health services they need. Next month we will announce the new shape and structure for the future health and disability system.  This will be the blueprint for how the system will work in the future. What I want to do today is reiterate the rationale and objectives of the reforms, what underpins our thinking, and the principles that will guide our choices. I hope this will give you some clarity on what we want to achieve. VisionOur guiding vision is for a health system delivering pae ora / healthy futures for all New Zealanders, where people live longer in good health and have an improved quality of life.If we are to realise this vision, the reforms need to focus on how we achieve five outcomes, above others.  These are:Equity for all New Zealanders – so everyone can achieve the same outcomes, and have the same access to services and support, regardless of who they are or where they live. Partnership – through embedding the voice of Māori and other consumers of care into how the system plans and makes decisions, ensuring that Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles are meaningfully upheld. Excellence – ensuring consistent, high-quality care is available when people need it, and harnessing leadership, innovation and new technologies to the benefit of the whole population.Sustainability – focusing the health system on prevention and not just treating people when they are unwell – ‘wellness not illness’ – and ensuring that we use resources to achieve the best value for money.Person and whānau-centred care – by aiming to empower people to manage their own health and wellbeing and put them in control of the support they receive.I am sure that people listening today will recognise elements of this vision.  These are some of the essential principles on which all good health systems should be based.By seriously addressing the shortcomings in our public health system today, we have a real opportunity to truly achieve this vision. The current systemIt is worth reminding ourselves of the scale of our publicly funded health and disability system.The current system covers many organisations and a significant proportion of New Zealand’s workforce.  77,000 people work in the 20 district health boards.  And another 145,000 work in health organisations across the country, including in our 30 primary health organisations.  There are nearly 17,000 practising doctors in New Zealand and nearly 60,000 nurses.Representatives of many of those people are here in the room today and watching on the livestream. Thank you for everything you do for New Zealand. The case for changeCompared to other countries, our health system performs well on a range of measures.  On average, New Zealand is around or above those countries we like to compare ourselves with for key indicators such as life expectancy and avoidable deathsBut we know that ours is a system under increasing stress and its design has not enabled it to deliver equitably for all New Zealanders.First and foremost, we must make changes to tackle the persistent inequity in health outcomes.Life expectancy at birth for Māori and Pacific peoples is more than five years below the New Zealand average.  Around half of Māori and Pacific deaths are potentially avoidable, compared to under a quarter of those for other New Zealanders. We can change these results if we re-think how Māori and Pacific communities get access to healthcare and think about how healthcare services are delivered. This is in part about how we support kaupapa Māori services. But it is also about how the rest of the health system engages with these communities.Let me turn to our disabled community. They also face inequitable outcomes.  Only 50% of disabled people rate their health as good, compared to 89 percent of the rest of the population.We have heard the disabled community’s views on the Review recommendations about how disability support services are governed in the future; and we know that work is still needed to improve access to health services and outcomes for disabled people.  The Minister for Disability Issues Carmel Sepuloni and I have requested separate advice looking at the governance of disability support services and where it sits in wider government structures. We need to bear in mind that members of this community are not only high users of health services, but users of other services that enable them to live safely in the community.We will continue to actively engage with the disability community on any future governance models.Improving outcomes for those traditionally underserved by our health system – for Māori, Pacific, disabled and rural communities, among others – is central to the reforms we undertake.It is not good enough for our health system to be good for many if the outcomes for others are lesser because of social and community factors that, with a bit more effort, can be readily addressed.Cohesion / variation across the systemPart of the reason for inequity is the way that the health system is structured and operates.The Health and Disability System Review report said that the system has become complex and unnecessarily fragmented. Organisations have unclear or overlapping roles, responsibilities and boundaries. There is significant duplication of activity, and variation that creates a post-code lottery when it comes to accessing services. For example:In some DHBs, people are twice as likely to die from potentially preventable causes than in others, and three times more likely to be re-admitted to hospital for urgent needs.Some New Zealanders are twice as likely to get knee replacement surgery than others.In over half of our DHBs, more than 10% of people did not receive cancer treatment within 62 days from diagnosis. In the lowest performing DHBs, nearly a third of people were still waiting for cancer treatment after 62 days. Where you live in New Zealand should not dictate your access to good quality health services. System arrangementsThis postcode health lottery is well documented – and it is the consequence of a system that is too disjointed and not sufficiently focused on the population as a whole.In the future, the health and disability system should be centred more around what people need and want from their health services.  The public do not have a consistent say in the operation of the system or often have little choice about how they access services.  Iwi and Māori communities are frequently consulted, but often in an advisory rather than decision-making capacity.Service improvements and the uptake of new technologies has been sluggish, with little shift of services from hospital to community environments, despite this being government policy for more than 20 years. Funding arrangements provide little local discretion for innovation and are unpredictable, making long-term planning difficult.Split and fragmented responsibilities for everything from IT to human resources make it difficult to work across the system, share data and analytics, and identify and spread best practice.  The future system will need to have the right settings in place to make it easier to innovate, to be able to rapidly adopt new technology that can enhance people’s experience of health services, and to help people to better manage their health at home and in their communities.As noted in the Review, the system will also need to take a stronger population health approach in the future.  This means understanding what the population needs from services and the best ways to deliver on these needs.  It also means working together to address the wider determinants of health.All this adds up to the need for a system that is more consistent and cohesive across the country. Urgency to actThe system is under stress now.  We know this from the indicators I have described, and the financial position of district health boards.And this situation is only going to worsen without reform.  By 2030, it is expected that 20 percent of New Zealanders will be aged 65+, compared with 16 percent in 2020.  With an ageing population and growing burden of chronic disease we know that the demand for health services is going to grow substantially over the next decade. What’s more, from talking with many people within the sector and around the country I am overwhelmed by widespread agreement on the need for change and an expectation that we move quickly.The reformed health systemSo how do we tackle these longstanding issues and take the opportunity of reform to build a better, fairer health system?I want to say a little about how I see the system changing, and the most important shifts that will be needed in the future.In my mind, there are five key shifts that must happen.Firstly, the health system will reinforce Te Tiriti principles and obligations.  We have to accept that the way our system presently delivers for Māori is inadequate.  This simply must change. We must ensure partnership and effective iwi and Māori leadership at all levels.  Māori involvement in determining direction, priorities, service design and delivery to address Māori health needs will be the norm, not the exception.  And to ensure that support is appropriate and accessible, the system will provide more kaupapa Māori services and options as part of integrated service arrangements.At the core of our reform is a by Māori, for Māori approach - our role as the Crown is to be the enablers of change, and the not the barriers to it.Addressing inequities is not about creating an advantage. There is no advantage in being sicker and dying younger. It’s about removing disadvantage and ensuring everyone has access to the same level of high-quality care and the same opportunity to experience good health outcomes. As already announced, the health system of the future will include a Māori Health Authority to centre the Tiriti o Waitangi partnership.  It will also be key to shaping how Māori exercise rangatiratanga over their own healthcare. But this is not just about creating a new entity.  Reinforcing partnership is the responsibility of all people in the system and will need to see active change in all organisations to further embed a Māori voice.    Alongside that, we are focused on ensuring Pacific people and disabled people have a voice and influence in shaping the care they receive, and exercise agency over their own wellbeing.Secondly, all people will be able to access a comprehensive range of support in their local communities to help them stay well.  This means ensuring a better range of integrated primary and community services in all areas, with increased access and protected funding.  Services will be designed around the needs and priorities of communities and will work together to improve the health of their local population.  People and whānau will have more options to manage their own health and wellbeing through access to information, advice, community support and targeted services.  Government services will work together better around communities to link up support for those who need it most.There are already many examples of innovation in primary and community services.  The Health Care Home model, for example, is encouraging a multi-disciplinary team based approach to meeting people’s needs, and supporting more convenient access through both digital and face to face channels to a wider range of services in local clinics.   Evidence shows this helps people to stay independent, reduces hospital admissions, and supports staff to develop new skills.This is the sort of change we need, but at present it is confined to certain areas.  The opportunity is to redesign the system to encourage integration and innovation in all places.Thirdly, everyone will have access to high quality emergency or specialist care when they need it.  Services will be planned across the whole New Zealand population to ensure the best distribution of care and equitable access for people in different regions.  Hospital and specialist services will work cohesively to share best practice, operating as part of a single system and not just in the interests of their organisation.Increasingly, we have seen initiatives in recent years that are attempting to break down barriers between areas of the country.  There are now a number of clinical networks which bring together professionals around different pathways to share innovation and inform planning.  There are more examples of DHBs providing specialist services for people in other areas where their local DHB is not able to meet demand.But these developments are often in spite of the system, not because of it.  We need to see cohesive and collective planning as the norm for many services.Fourthly, digital services will provide more people the care they need in their homes and local communities.  Digital technology must finally, after years of promise, become a key feature of the system for patients and professionals.Digital technology is already a part of our everyday lives, and is increasingly becoming part of health services too.We have already seen through the COVID response how many services were able to shift quickly to using digital platforms, without a reduction in quality of care.  With the pandemic as the catalyst, we achieved greater transformation of digital services in a matter of weeks than we did in many years.This shows what can be done – the challenge is now to build on this and take the opportunity to shift models for good.If we get this right, the ways in which people access services will be more simple and more equitable, with greater innovation and choice for digital options bringing some services closer to homes than ever before.People will have access to virtual diagnostic services, primary care and increasingly to more specialist services wherever they live – meaning that many unnecessary trips to hospitals and clinics can be avoided.Throughout the system, proven technologies that improve care will be adopted faster and rolled out at scale.And, finally, health and care workers will be valued and well-trained for the future health system.  I acknowledge our health workforce is feeling increasingly stressed, managing growing demand on services with limited resources.  A key element of these reforms is helping to ensure we have enough trained people who are resourced to provide better services for our communities.Long-term planning and funding will ensure the system has enough workers with the right skills to improve equity and meet the challenges of an ageing population.  Across the system, professional groups will focus on the health and wellbeing of the population as a whole, and the shared values and motivations that underpin the system. Organisations will not compete for, but will work together on where and how skills are deployed for the benefit of the whole system.You will notice, I’m sure, a few things that are common across these five shifts.One of these common drivers is the desire to make the system work more cohesively and collectively, framed by a spirit of collaboration that sees one system delivering for all of New Zealand.Another is the aim to promote wellbeing and quality of life, to reduce avoidable contacts with the health system, and to rebalance away from a reliance on hospital services, towards greater investment and access in primary and community services.And finally, what they have common, is that in each case there are examples of these shifts already happening around New Zealand.  Local leadership is already pushing at these changes.  But often their efforts do not get recognised and cannot easily be scaled and implemented more widely.  The opportunity we have now is to build from the best of the current system.ConclusionNone of the shifts I’ve discussed are easy to achieve.  This Government certainly does not underestimate the size or the complexity of the task.Many of the challenges we face are not just specific to New Zealand but are being faced by health systems around the world.Of course, we must maintain services for our communities as we transition to the future – and this includes delivering the COVID-19 vaccination programme in full as our top priority.  The work of the health system every day is essential, and must be protected from disruption.But we should not let this become a barrier to change – and we owe it to the dedicated health and care workers in our system and the wider public to make the transformation needed.But I am convinced that the scope of our ambition is right, and that we have a real opportunity for meaningful change.What I want to emphasise is the need for partnership. In the coming weeks Cabinet will make decisions about the high level structural elements of the system.But we all know government alone cannot achieve the change we need. To build a better health system will require input from and partnership with organisations, groups, professions, patients and whānau.The hard work lies ahead in designing how the future system will work, the relationships and accountabilities, and the care models which people will experience.The immediate need after Cabinet’s decisions will be engagement about how we get the details right.Those in this room and watching on the livestream will be critical to the success of Health and Disability Reform.I look forward to working with you to deliver change, and truly create the “one system” culture in our health services; one excellent system to meet the diverse needs of our small nation.Kia ora tatau katoa."
2021-03-23T18:00:00Z,        Hon James Shaw,  Minister Shaw addresses the global Ministerial on Climate Action ,"Tēnā koutou katoa ngā mihi nui kia koutou.  To stay within the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals and build a more resilient and thriving future, we need to cut global emissions by 45 percent below 2010 levels by 2030.So far the world has committed to only a fraction of what is required. But having delayed action for decades, there is still time – and that’s what makes the moment we find ourselves in now so exciting.COP26 is now less than eight months away, so now is the time we must decisively choose the future we want for our children. If countries can come to Glasgow with clear, bold and transformative plans for reducing emissions, the low carbon future we have talked about for years will be closer within reach than ever before.Yes, it will be challenge, but the opportunity ahead of us is huge. Strong, inclusive, and climate-friendly economies that support the recovery from COVID, create new jobs, and encourage innovation - all within planetary limits.Here in Aotearoa New Zealand our independent, science-led Climate Change Commission is finalising advice to the Government on the pathway we must follow to build a low emissions economy by 2050. Once we receive that advice I will lead development of a detailed Emissions Reduction Plan that I intend to bring to COP26 setting out the action to reduce emissions in every sector of our economy. I will also lead a revision of New Zealand’s Nationally Determined Contribution to ensure we are playing our part to keep the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.Climate finance is a critical pillar of real and tangible climate change action across the world and I am pleased to confirm today that, despite the economic pressures brought about by the pandemic, New Zealand is on track to significantly exceed its current climate finance commitment. We will build on this and ahead of COP26 confirm our next climate finance commitment to support other countries to develop along a low emissions pathway, as well as to undertake the adaptation measures necessary to protect lives, livelihoods and infrastructure from unavoidable climate change impacts.I look forward to hearing about similar progress being made across the world, as well as the plans you all have in place to help accelerate a shared transition to a low carbon future. No reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tatou katoa. "
2021-03-22T20:24:08Z,        Hon Carmel Sepuloni,  Speech at NZ Opera's Ihitai ‘Avei’a – Star Navigator,"Tēnā koutou katoa, Ia orana, Fa’atalofa atu, Mālō e lelei, Tālofa ni, Kia orāna, Fakaalofa atu, Ni sa bula Vinaka, Tālofa, Noa'ia and warm Pacifc greetings to you all.Two years ago, New Zealand marked the 250th anniversary of the first onshore meetings between Māori and Europeans, during the 1769 maiden voyage of the HMS Endeavour.I think it’s fair to say that there was a level of nervousness in the lead up to the Tuia 250 commemorations.  Concerns that perhaps an acknowledgement of that 250 years would again negate or ignore the incredible feats of the Pacific voyagers who travelled across Te Moananui-a-Kiwa to settle in New Zealand many centuries ago. But instead the commemorations were designed in such a way that we could give air to stories that had not often been told. Conversations were sparked that enabled a deeper understanding of our shared histories.I am delighted those conversations continue tonight with Ihitai ‘Avei’a – Star Navigator, a production which explores Pacific navigation and the coming together of peoples from different countries and cultures.Tupaia, the Tahitian tahua and star navigator who sailed with Lieutenant James Cook on the Endeavour in 1769, is an important figure in Aotearoa’s history.He played a pivotal role in translating and mediating between Māori communities and the crew of the Endeavour during their first visit to New Zealand.It is testament to how very different history can look from different perspectives, that the Endeavour was remembered by Māori as ‘Tupaia’s ship’. Yet until recently, Tupaia’s role, and even his existence on the Endeavour, were not emphasised, and many New Zealanders may have gone through school without hearing of him.So it is very pleasing to see Tupaia’s story explored through the powerful medium of opera.This work brings together two brilliant artists from different walks of creative life – Te Awamutu-born singer Tim Finn, and Tahitian-born writer Célestine Hitiura Vaite.It features much-loved opera singers Amitai Pati, Paul Whelan and upcoming star Natasha Wilson; Norah Stevenson-Tuuga, performing the Purea’s monologues;the Manukau Symphony Orchestra; Auckland Choral; and the Graduate Choir New Zealand.I’m excited to witness the magic of all these artists coming together – which of course is one of the beautiful things about opera as an artform.Ihitai ‘Avei’a – Star Navigator is about a journey, but behind the scenes, NZ Opera is on a journey too – a journey to re-imagine opera within the Aotearoa New Zealand context.  How proud I am as a Pacific New Zealander to see the recognition of our pacific uniqueness and our stories, in opera.On this note, I wish to acknowledge the operatic trailblazers that have come before.  Not least of which was the pioneering Samoan Born, NZ opera singer, the late Iosefa Enari.  His accomplishments were many but the one I will refer to tonight is his role as artistic director for Classical Polynesia, the first NZ opera that combined traditional samoan language and stories with classical opera.  I’ve been told by his name sake, my friend Iosefa Enari who is with me here tonight that he would be proud of the way NZ Opera is pushing the boundaries of operatic tradition – and taking it in a direction only a New Zealand company could. It is unique and it is to be commended. Ihitai ‘Avei’a – Star Navigator shows what riches this journey of diversification and pride of place and our unique history can add to the repertoire offered by NZ opera.It shows, too, how an artistic collaboration – in this case, an intergenerational, cross-genre and cross-cultural collaboration – can open up conversations important to all New Zealanders.My congratulations to Tim and Célestine, the cast, the musicians and the creative team. Thank you also to NZ Opera and its supporters and collaborators, including the West Australian Opera, Victorian Opera and Auckland Arts Festival.After the disruption and uncertainty of 2020, I am delighted – and privileged – to be here with a live audience to see such an exciting concert, and I look forward to what is sure to be a memorable opening night."
2021-03-18T20:17:55Z,        Hon Stuart Nash,"  Speech to Otago Tourism Policy School, Queenstown","How we got hereThis conference is framed as a forum to discuss “challenges and opportunities in the field of tourism and sustainable development”.We have plenty of both before us today.I am going to take some time to step through the brief you have given me, so bear with me if I take the full 20-30 minutes or so allocated for this speech.In doing so, I want to canvass issues that confronted us in 2020; issues that are confronting us today in 2021; and issues that are looming for 2022, when we anticipate our international borders will likely open.The health and wellbeing of New Zealanders required the unprecedented decision to close our border. We made a commitment to preserve life, to protect our communities, and to protect our health workers. Our emphasis from the very beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was that a strong health response was also the best economic response.We remain steadfast in this view.Since February 2020, surges of COVID-19 infection and months of subsequent lockdowns has devastated the lives and livelihoods of billions around the world. And although we can gather in this enclosed space today because of the measures we have taken and because of the great sacrifices all New Zealanders have made, I know from speaking to you over these past weeks and months that the toll on the tourism and hospitality sector has been devastating. It has been devastating worldwide. The UN World Tourism Organization (WTO) has found that in 2020 global tourism suffered its deepest crisis on record with a drop of 74% in international visitors.Asia and the Pacific reeled from an even greater impact with an 84% decrease in international arrivals in 2020, or about 300 million less arrivals than in the previous year. And the reality from the WTO is that the global tourism outlook will not improve for some time yet; and could, in fact, significantly worsen.Support during changeChange of the magnitude of a global pandemic is incredibly hard to come up against. It’s hard on our businesses, of course, but it’s hard on our communities, and it’s hard on our families too.It is harder still when the change is so sudden and so total.The Government’s initial response was to act, but we initially only had imperfect information to act on.Rightly, we worked with what was available to us under such extraordinary circumstances, and moved quickly to introduce support packages for people and businesses.The Government invested $400 million in tourism recovery alone. To date this is the greatest single amount invested in tourism in New Zealand’s history. This amount also included $299 million in cash grants and loans for 130 businesses and $20.2 million for New Zealand’s 31 Regional Tourism Organisations.It helped to protect valuable and vulnerable tourism assets.It helped our communities to implement local destination management and planning, and to encourage more New Zealander’s to explore their communities.Tourism businesses could also access broader social support, such as the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme and the COVID-19 Small Business Cashflow Scheme. Indeed, it is estimated that tourism and hospitality businesses received $1.8 billion in wage subsidies and $300million in zero-interest small business loans.Mindful of the pressure from alert level changes, the Government recently extended the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Scheme for those businesses affected by the rise in alert levels from 4 March 2021.The Government has also maintained international air connectivity throughout the pandemic with the International Air Freight Capacity Scheme.This scheme supports airlines to operate flights to-and-from New Zealand. This has maintained flows of high-value exports and critical imports, but also, links to key visitor markets that will be much needed to recover both inbound and outbound tourism when it is safe to re-open the border again.The Government followed up the wide-ranging and far-reaching support packages with the heavily promoted domestic tourism campaign ‘Do Something New, New Zealand’. And although domestic tourism spend was up 24 per cent to $1.17 billion in January of this year at the summer peak, compared to January of 2020, total visitor spend has fallen 11% overall, exposing the gap still felt by the absence of our international visitors.Of course some communities have been hit harder than others, and I speak from one of these today.However, these emergency interventions were only ever sustainable in the short-term.What these interventions did though was buy time for people. They bought time for people to adapt, if they could, to downsize, if possible, to have hard conversations with their financial advisers, and honest conversations with their employees.So what are the next difficult and hard questions that confront us, as policy makers.The reality is that we have a responsibility to take an intergenerational view of the role of tourism in New Zealand.It can’t go back to how it was.I believe that in a number of places, the industry was beginning to erode its social licence to operate, and therefore losing the community’s support for continued growth of the sort we were seeing.  Perhaps we had also passed the tipping point, in some key iconic spots, of not delivering on our global brand of 100% Pure.This sentiment is echoed by a number of industry experts in the book ‘100% Pure Future, New Zealand Tourism Renewed’ The contributors view the interruption to tourism by the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to take a long, hard look at the sector and chance to fix the long-standing issues in the tourism system today.This is a viewpoint I have echoed myself.I am leading a programme of work that will move from volume to value as a determinant of success, and the core of our global marketing strategy.It is also a central thesis of the work undertaken by Grant Webster, Steve Chadwick, the Tourism Futures Taskforce and its Advisory Group.Their independent report on the future of tourism in New Zealand will be published soon. I want to acknowledge all the hard work the Taskforce has put in here, and I know that the sector is keen to read it.I understand at least ten members of the Taskforce, and its Advisory Panel, are participating in this conference. So a heartfelt thanks for your input and work, it is very much appreciated.Pressure has been buildingPressures from visitor growth over the past decade or so have highlighted that the challenges need to be more carefully thought through than they have been in the past.Indeed, Queenstown is one of the places where the calls for the need to address tourism have been the loudest. In particular on: traffic congestion, accommodation prices, road accidents, and staff shortages.The November 2019 ‘Mood of the Nation’ research done for the tourism industry found that 78 per cent of residents here were more likely to think there was too much pressure from international visitors. That was more than double that of the New Zealand population in general.But, for the time being we must continue to balance the exceptional circumstances of the tourism sector, with the needs of communities, and with the paramount requirement to continue to maintain the safety of New Zealanders.And we will make sure when the border is reopened that it is done safely and it is done correctly.Now’s the time for changeHowever, there is plenty of work to do now to prepare for when international visitors do return.Members from the sector, industry experts, and I think most New Zealanders, all recognise that prior to COVID-19, unsustainable tourism levels put far too much undue pressure on communities and our natural attractions and many communities have struggled to absorb.In addition to the calls from the public, the tourism industry, from small communities, the Government has received multiple pieces of advice and reports that outlines the significant challenges we face today.So we have a very good understanding of the lay of the land, and it’s time to take action.In 2020 we moved to get cash out the door quickly, directly to affected businesses, some of whom are represented in this room today.As we said at the time, we had to move fast, with a no regrets approach.That was 2020.I accept that Tourism needs further help in 2021, before we prepare for big changes in 2022.While a significant work programme lies ahead, recovery comes first. A significant work programme, but recovery comes first I am deeply concerned about the situation unfolding in communities like Queenstown, the West Coast, Fiordland, MacKenzie District and Kaikoura that are so reliant upon international tourism.I am considering structural and targeted initiatives to support some of the worst affected communities.I am proposing a three-part work programme. My first priority is to support those communities most affected by the loss of international tourism.But it’s important to say for the record – we are not considering a regional wage subsidy. It is not sustainable nor fair. The wage subsidy, like resurgence payments, operates on the same principle for all businesses nationwide that have a drop in revenueAlso for the record, we are not going back to the model of STAPP grants. We have heard loud and clear that’s not what the industry wants.Further support for tourism requires a more structural and targeted approach that goes to the heart of business operations, and jobs, for those who need it mostI have been talking to tourism businesses and local government leaders, and fellow Ministers, about possible interventionsI hope to shortly outline a number of measures with the following objectives:A targeted focus on those areas that have fallen the furthest, those regions where there is a heavy reliance on international tourism The advice is that South Westland; Queenstown Lakes; Fiordland; MacKenzie District-Aoraki Mt Cook; and Kaikoura have taken bigger hits than many The second objective is to enable tourism businesses to make hard decisions around their current operations.This may require us to help make advice available from those who have deep expertise and experience, in areas like business continuity in times of extreme uncertainty. This may require steps to make it easier to hibernate or suspend a company, and then provide support when they are ready to start up again This is because we want to then ensure those tourism businesses that do choose a form of suspension don’t face a significant financial burden when gearing up to open once international tourists start arriving. We also want to help regional leaders to diversify their local economies in order to improve their long-term resilience. Regions heavily reliant on international tourism, dare I say it – overly reliant on international tourism, should have a range of alternatives because we don’t want to be in this situation again.Central government is doing its part by stepping in with support for infrastructure and regional economic development, and redeploying tourism workers into jobs on the Conservation Estate or for infrastructure builds.I believe we can do more in terms of energising economic diversification.And the fifth and final objective is to support the mental health needs and psycho-social needs of workers and business owners in those regions that are having the hardest time.We all want tourism to transition to more sustainable practices. But we cannot leave people and communities behind.I do recognise that in some areas, it’s not simply about supporting tourism businesses, but ensuring communities survive.In fact, the region that has had the biggest hit with the loss of international tourism is Auckland. However all advice tells us that when the Auckland tourism sector suffers in this way, it doesn’t bring down whole communities, like it may in other regions with a significantly higher economic exposure. Which brings me to next steps – the long term picture for tourism once international visitors return, likely in 2022From recovery to transition: my vision for the future of tourismThe latter two parts of the work programme include policy changes, and sectoral changes.In policy, I will be following through on changes to the freedom camping regime. And I would like to see changes in pricing strategies across our public assets, so that they become financially self-sustaining. I would like this to include a closer look at existing local levies, changes to the International Visitor Conservation and Tourism Levy.I will be working closely with the Minister of Conservation on her approach to pricing for public conservation lands and waters.The third part of the work programme will require the sector to step up and co-own and co-invest in this change.This could mean developing Industry Transformation Plans (ITP) in partnership between government, business, workers and Māori. ITPs are going to be a key component of lifting the productivity, sustainability and inclusivity of the tourism sector.And in a town like Queenstown which is a year-round tourism destination, the workers in your tourism businesses must have year-round secure housingThis work programme is an extension of my overarching four principles for tourism which I outlined to the Tourism Industry Aotearoa conference last year.We have an opportunity to re-shape tourism so that when the border does re-open, visitors, the sector, and our local communities are operating on a much improved model.If we are to be one of the top three, globally aspirational destinations, we need our tourism sector to be productive, sustainable, inclusive and innovative.We must be able to deliver on our global value proposition and our brand promises.It is imperative that our tourism sector improves the wellbeing of New Zealanders and protects and restore our natural environment.This is needed in order to regain the social licence that is so important to take New Zealanders along on our journey of re-imagining tourism, post-COVID. When international visitors return, I am adamant that the tourism sector will be transformed in a way that emphasises value and social licence in a way that we were not delivering before.We have to now take an inter-generational approach. My four principles that will guide this transformation should be familiar to you. They are as follows:‘Brand New Zealand’ and our global value propositionFirstly, I want to enhance ‘Brand New Zealand’ and refresh our global value proposition.We must elevate our brand so that New Zealand is seen as one of the most aspirational global travel destinations. Then it will be Tourism New Zealand’s role, to turn this aspiration into action.Our natural environment is critical to our wellbeing, our culture, our global brand, as well as our national identity. New Zealand’s reputation for sustainability and environmental integrity is a core part of our export brandIt is one of a number of reasons I am targeting the unsustainable burden of a sub-section of our freedom camping sector. As we continue our COVID-19 recovery, we’re investing in nature to support thousands of people into jobs now, and to enhance our environment for generations of kiwis and foreign visitors to come.Elevating our brand also involves enhancing it. We want to do this in order to support the move to a ‘higher value’ international visitor.I would like to establish New Zealand as the #1 destination for unparalleled quality and safety, against which others are measured, and make New Zealanders feel proud of what our country offers to the world.This is aspirational but in my opinion not impossible. Our mission should be to be the best in the world.An opportunity to re-set & rebuild on a sustainable modelMy second principle is to make this an opportunity to re-set and rebuild tourism on a financially sustainable model.There are very real concerns about the sustainability of tourism as it existed pre-COVID. These have been echoed by experts and documented in recent reports, including in February’s Parliamentary Commission for the Environment report ‘Not 100% - but four steps closer to sustainable tourism’. We must take the opportunity we have now to re-set the operating model for the sector on a far more sustainable and resilient basis, and we need to do this before international visitors return. Work is underway in this regard, since the adoption of the Government’s New Zealand-Aotearoa Tourism Strategy. Tied directly to this is my intention to build more meaningful partnerships with Treaty Partners to ensure effective and on-going engagement with Māori.I will always encourage, enable and support partnerships between Māori tourism enterprise, iwi, hapū and tangata whenua, government, industry, businesses, regions, as well as communities, to engage and collaborate on projects that lead to improved tourism outcomes.Our culture is one of our global competitive advantages and we should work hard to tell our unique and wonderful stories, and to be inclusive at every point in the tourism journey.Destination Management has also been a key part of ensuring that community aspirations drive the tourism offering, including for residents, iwi, DOC, local government, and the sector. Destination management covers infrastructure, environmental, cultural, and social dimensions of tourism offerings. It aims to develop a regional proposition that delivers exceptional experiences for both international and domestic visitors.In alignment with that work, I will shortly open Round Five, the final round, of the Tourism Infrastructure Fund (TIF).The TIF was established in 2017 and earmarked $100 million over four years to support local government by co-funding projects to build and maintain visitor-related public infrastructure.This co-funded approach is required because local government, especially those councils with small rating bases, cannot fully cope with the costs of visitors Taxpayers and ratepayers are bearing a big share of the cost of the visitor experience – surely one of the few sectors where this happens. I am taking advice about how to ensure that Round Five of this fund is targeted at the handful of regions that need it most.That will be clearly set out in the priorities statement that guides applications for the Fund. Costs of tourism are priced into the visitor experienceMy third principle is to ensure that costs associated with tourism are priced into the visitor experience.As I’ve said, the costs and benefits from tourism do not always fall in the same place. There are also a number of negative environmental impacts as outlined in the PCE report, such as biodiversity loss, solid waste, greenhouse gas emissions, and water quality degradation.There are also intangible impacts on communities from seasonal work and seasonal tourism patterns,Industry as partners in transformationMy fourth principle is to welcome industry as partners in this transformation. Government and the sector have been intertwined throughout New Zealand tourism’s history. This won’t change, but it will need to evolve to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. I want to be clear that the sector must co-own and co-invest in its future and the necessary changes required for tourism to enrich New Zealand. This will require real industry leadership and commitment.And we’ve seen how good this commitment can be with, for example, the resounding support shown by the industry in signing up in large numbers to the Tourism Sustainability Commitment, and the real interest in the work of the Tourism Futures Taskforce.I have no doubt that we will be able to unlock similar levels of action and engagement in the future.ConclusionThe status quo cannot, will not be the model of the direction of tourism. That much is clear. It is unsustainable, it lacks resilience, and we won’t go back to how it was.  The world has been changed by COVID-19, and so we must change with it.The argument for not doing all we can to transform the sector is utterly untenable in 2021.I have outlined my four principles to lead us off on the transformation journey:We must make the necessary changes to ensure ‘Brand New Zealand’ is seen as one of the world’s most aspirational global travel destinations.We have an opportunity to re-set and rebuild tourism on a sustainable model and the industry simply cannot return to ‘business as usual’.The costs and negative impacts associated with tourism must be mitigated or priced into the visitor experience, and not funded by New Zealand rate and tax payers.The Government intends to partner with the industry, both businesses and workers, and this is essential to achieve this transformation.We have an opportunity now, while the borders are closed, to re-shape tourism so that when we re-open, and international visitors return in meaningful numbers, the sector, and our host communities are operating on more assured model. There’s a lot of work to do, but I want to reiterate that we won’t leave our worst affected communities behind.ENDS"
2021-03-16T19:37:39Z,        Hon Jan Tinetti,   National Statement to the Commission of the Status of Women,"E aku rangatira, tēnā koutou katoa, ka nui te honore, ki te mihi, ki a koutou Honoured leaders, I acknowledge and greet you allMr Chair,I am honoured to join you and our colleagues from around the world during the 65th session of the Commission on the Status of Women. I look forward to the time when it will once again be safe for us to gather together in person. I welcome the opportunity harnessed by this Commission in using technology to encourage increased participation and engagement in discussions from women and girls around the globe.Aotearoa New Zealand welcomes and endorses the statement made by Tuvalu on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum member states, with Permanent Missions to the United Nations. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s priority theme has never been more important. The pandemic has radically changed our lives. COVID-19 has made clear just how interconnected health, economic, and social issues are in our society. The health of our people impacts, and is impacted by, the health of our economy, and vice versa. It has also highlighted and exacerbated structural inequalities that disproportionately affect women and girls. When we fully and meaningfully include women and girls in leadership and decision-making roles, we ensure that our responses to the effects of the pandemic and the longer-term effects of the climate crisis will meet the needs of everyone. Women’s leadership and participation in public life has been on an upward trajectory in recent years in Aotearoa. We have closed the gender leadership gap in our Public Service through a deliberate strategy implemented over the past three years. It is also encouraging that increasing numbers of Māori women in particular are leading businesses across all regions of Aotearoa New Zealand. A range of initiatives are underway to reduce barriers to women’s and girls’ participation in public life. Simple things – like making period products freely available in all schools - and more complex things – like passing an amendment to the Equal Pay Act last year, to make it easier for female dominated professions to be paid fairly for the work they do.We will continue to accelerate our efforts to eliminate gender-based discrimination, and there is more to do, particularly to reduce rates of gender-based violence. The New Zealand Government is moving towards a more effective system to prevent and respond to family and sexual violence, and has created a multi-agency joint business unit to lead that work.We have significantly increased investment into services that prevent and respond to violence, and are working with our neighbours in the Pacific to support survivors of gender-based violence there. It will take a significant effort of many people, groups and communities to change social norms, rebuild our systems to better support victims, and protect the rights of those affected by gender-based violence. New challenges are emerging, and familiar challenges are intensifying. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that collective efforts are needed to promote global health, while the effects of the climate crisis have become undeniable. When compared with other groups, women and girls, and particularly those facing intersecting forms of discrimination, disproportionately shoulder the burden of both these challenges, especially when opportunities to participate effectively in decision-making are limited. Aotearoa New Zealand is taking steps to address these issues at home, but the problems are not yet solved. Real progress can be made when we work together locally and globally. Mr Chair,Challenges that affect women and girls affect all of our countries, no matter what region we are from. As we continue to strive towards our global goal of achieving full and effective participation to empower women and girls in all aspects of public life, it is critical that we draw on our shared experiences and work together to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.Aotearoa New Zealand reconfirms its long-standing strong and unwavering commitment to advance the rights of women and girls in all their diversity. We remain committed to continued cooperation and engagement with our colleagues from around the world in working towards the realisation of gender equality. Ngā mihi nui. Thank you."
2021-03-16T03:47:15Z,        Hon David Parker,"  Speech to Dairy NZ event, March 16","Good evening.Thank you for the invitation to speak to you tonight. I want to acknowledge the efforts of those farmers who put environmental outcomes at the heart of their decision making – and to encourage further efforts across the sector.Most New Zealanders in both rural and urban areas want waterways cleaned up where they are degraded - and protected where they are not. This is for both environmental and economic reasons.I know the vast majority of people who live in rural and urban areas think the most important waterway is the one they live closest to and use and swim in. And they agree with the proposition that if my waterway is clean and your waterway is clean then they will all be clean.International consumers in the high value segments of markets have increasing expectations of sustainable production, as well as food safety and the overall health benefits of what they buy and eat. And they pay a premium for it.Our brand as a country – and that includes our appeal as a tourist destination – is also linked to the health of our waterways.We all have a role to play – farmers, local catchment management groups, farm organisations like Dairy NZ and Beef + Lamb, as well as environmental NGOs, scientists, central and local government. We must find solutions to the issues we are facing.This way we can continue to prosper in an increasingly discerning and competitive international market. The growth in dairying, particularly in the South Island, has made the sector, its practices and effects, of increasing public interest.The number of dairy cows in New Zealand increased by 65 per cent from 1994 to 2017 (or from 4 million to 6.6 million). This was concentrated in some regions, with Southland cow numbers growing tenfold over recent decades.Last year the Essential Freshwater package was put in place:to stop further degradation of New Zealand’s freshwater resources and start making immediate improvements so that water quality is materially improving within five years; andto reverse past damage to bring New Zealand’s freshwater resources, waterways and ecosystems to a healthy state within a generation.New Zealanders overwhelmingly supported the intention of these reforms.For some years I have been highlighting some of the worst problems, including around intensive winter grazing (IWG), and am pleased we are now pursuing solutions rather than arguing about the problems.In the 2019 intensive winter grazing season Environment Southland undertook compliance flights to monitor farmers’ implementation of required good management practices. This found widespread evidence of poor practice and this was reinforced by members of the public and the media. The Minister of Agriculture promoted standards for animal welfare in 2019 and then last year we introduced regulations requiring freshwater improvements via a new National Policy Statement and a National Environment Statement (NES).In September 2020 the Minister of Agriculture and I accepted an offer from Environment Southland and farming sector representatives for them to look at the IWG regulations in the NES-F, to provide practical recommendations for improving implementation and IWG practice. We agreed Southland Fish and Game Council and Te Ao Marama – the local Ngai Tahu runanga – should be included.The Southland Advisory Group has recommended that we bring forward the IWG module of farm plans, recognising that they can’t yet be done in compliance with the certification and audit requirements in last year’s Resource Management Act  changes and the NES. They have asked us to enable a trial of IWG modules this year by deferring the implementation of the NES permitted activity and certified farm plan routes for a year.I have agreed.The development, testing and deployment of a prototype IWG module is now being accelerated. I have a commitment from the farming sector and regional councils to drive and clearly demonstrate real practice change for the 2021 winter grazing season. This is needed for animal welfare as well as water quality outcomes.The regulation which prevents significant increases in the area of IWG without a resource consent will remain, and will be enforced.During the year I hope we will perfect the IWG plan route in compliance with the RMA requirements, including certification and audit and underpinning requirements as to content. I also intend to update some details of the permitted activity route, which is a route that will still be needed. I have set out my expectations to councils and industry bodies. Increased monitoring and reporting by councils will also ensure measureable improvements in IWG practices. Thank you to those who are helping implement improvements. We are not there yet. We do have to ensure nutrient and sediment losses decrease substantially. I detect a significant change though, which encourages me to have hope. That is why I have agreed to these recommendations.I know it’s sometimes hard for leaders of elected industry bodies, who have to represent all of their members, including those who are not onside with change.I appreciate the leaders who have engaged constructively, and believe the outcome will see improved water quality to the benefit of the country and your members.ENDS"
2021-03-14T22:14:36Z,        Hon Marama Davidson,"  Speech to the 65th United Nations Commission on the Status of Women Side Event, March 15 2021","Tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you at this New Zealand session at the 65th conference of the Commission on the Status of Women. One could perhaps position this event as a global focus in a local context, or a local focus in a global context, but either way it’s an occasion for reflection on where we’ve been and where we are going, and how we stand accountable, and that makes it a wonderful opportunity for us all. And therefore, I’m very pleased to have the chance to talk today about the prevention of sexual and family violence against women in Aotearoa New Zealand, and the steps the Government and the community are making to take on this challenge. I was privileged to become Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence after last year’s election. In a simple sense, my vision is encapsulated in three words of that ministerial title – “the prevention of…” My long term vision for Aotearoa is simple. Every person deserves to live free from the fear of violence and to be able to access support they need when they need it. Violence truly should be an aberration, not the norm in daily life. I know many of you know full well the size of the problem in this country, and the complexities that make it such a difficult problem to solve. Gender-based violence is entrenched. Every day in our country it seems we are confronted by yet more news stories about acts of violence that have hurt, or killed, women and children. A 2019 report from the New Zealand Crimes and Victims Survey found that females were affected by offences committed by family members at twice the rate of males. Women were affected by offences by an intimate partner at more than three times the rate of men. Ministry of Justice research released in January reported that 33 percent of lesbian or gay adults will experience sexual violence during their lifetime from their partners. That is more than double the New Zealand average of 16 percent. To address family violence and sexual violence, we must ensure that we take action on a range of fronts, including ensuring that the fundamentals of human dignity are met. People need secure, healthy housing, adequate incomes and a welfare system that provides for a decent standard of living. People need a society that values all cultures and achieves gender equity. People need connected communities where it’s OK to ask for help and support is available when they need it. And they need a justice system that is easy to access, supportive and caring and does not further harm. I believe that we have the tools to break cycles of violence, to return families and communities to the places of safety and wellness, where children feel nourished and women – and all people – feel safe. We must do more to hold Māori leadership, perspectives and expertise at the centre of our thinking and our doing. That requires acknowledging – and I mean truly acknowledging, not just paying lip-service to –that solutions lie within Te Ao Māori for all of us. Ending violence against women is a priority for this government. It’s a priority for me, personally. In Budgets 2018, 2019 and 2020 we have taken a Joint Venture approach, and we significantly increased investment to address family violence and sexual violence through front line services. We have started to tip the balance of investment towards prevention. Investment in early intervention and prevention in the first 1000 days of a child’s life will be key. This is another key priority for me this term and I look forward to working with the Joint Venture and our communities to increase our prevention understanding and initiatives to stop violence from occurring in the first place.In September 2018, we created the Joint Venture, Family Violence and Sexual Violence – a whole-of-government response made up of 10 agencies with collective responsibility for government action. Ministers, likewise, are working closely to reduce and ultimately eliminate violence. On top of the Budgets of the last three years, there is ongoing work on developing a national strategy on FVSV. We will shortly be engaging with communities across Aotearoa as we listen to their voices and their experiences to shape how we will respond going forward. In the last term, the Government passed significant reforms to the family violence laws – the Domestic Violence Victims’ Protection Act and the Family Violence Act. This latter introduced new offences for strangulation, coerced marriage, and assault on a family member. We have introduced the Sexual Violence Legislation Bill to Parliament, which had its Second Reading late last month, and will put in place a range of additional protections for victims and complainants. Challenging social norms that allow and enable this violence will continue to be critical. We need to work together and we need our men ready to lead and prepared to address these issues. We can help stop family violence and sexual violence by doing simple things – noticing the signs, listening, asking questions and supporting one another. All of this may seem daunting, but we can draw encouragement from the many initiatives arising from within our communities to face up to family and sexual violence. Te Kahui Mana Ririki Trust established in 2008, runs a multi-layered campaign to end Māori child abuse, which include education for whānau, advocacy and research. They have a successful parenting programme which teaches non-violent parenting. The Campaign for Action on Family Violence is a community-based social marketing campaign established in 2007, which seeks to change the way New Zealanders think and act about family violence. We have all seen their very effective “It’s Not OK” advertising campaign. E Tū Whānau is a movement where Te Ao Māori draw on tikanga and Māori values to support strong, resilient whānau, free from violence. Since 2011, Pasefika Proud, has been working in homes, churches and sport and cultural settings nurturing community leaders and influencers who are able to inspire and support positive change. I believe partnership between the Government and the community has in recent years made real progress against violence towards women. But as we all appreciate, we are still on a very long journey and it will take all of us working together to ensure girls and women can grow up free from violence. "
2021-03-13T06:41:14Z,        Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern,"  Speech at Ko Tātou, Tātou – We are One: National Remembrance Service for the March 15 mosque attack","As-salamu Alaykum Tēnā koutou katoa.Ko Tātou, Tātou. On Monday, it will be two years since 51 New Zealanders’ lives were taken in the most tragic and horrific way.As I sat and tried to write the words to accompany our presence in this place, I was at a loss. Much has been said, but words, despite their healing power, will never change what happened that day. Words will not bring back those men, women, and children who had gathered at their place of worship, quietly and peacefully, when they were taken in an act of terror.Words will not remove the fear that descended over the Muslim community here in Aotearoa in the days, weeks and months that followed. Words will not take away the trauma that families, first responders, passers-by who became rescuers and so many others experienced that day. But while words cannot perform miracles, they do have the power to heal. That means we must use them wisely. To our Muslim community, that means using our voices and words to acknowledge the loss that was yours. The fathers, the brothers, the husbands and sons. The mothers and wives, the children who were lost and all those so gravely injured. Our duty is to not only remember what has been taken, but who your loved ones were, and what they gave to you, your community, and this place they called home. It means knowing that grief takes time, that the scars that have been left are many, and that we have a duty to listen, hear, and respond with words and deeds that support you while they heal. But perhaps most important of all, it means understanding that words, will be one of the most powerful ways we can show that March 15 has, or hasn’t, changed us. Sadly, if we assume that before that day in our history, our Muslim community hadn’t experienced hatred and racism, we would be wrong.In the aftermath of the terror attack, I heard the stories of women who were frequently harassed because they are easily identifiable as Muslim. Of children whose earliest experiences of racism were in their school grounds. Of horrible and dehumanising experiences that were so common, that perhaps most devastating of all, some gave up on doing anything about it.Many of us will remember, or indeed have seen children being taught from a very young age to be stoic. That if they face the harsh words of others they should adopt a stiff upper lift. Perhaps it has been our way of teaching children resilience in the face of those who might intend to cause harm.  Of course we want our children to be resilient, but surely no more than we want our children to be kind?And so we have to ask ourselves, what does it take to create a generation that is empathetic but strong. That is kind, but fair. That is knowledgeable but curious. That knows the power of words, and uses them to challenge, defend, and empower. In the aftermath of March 15, we have learned so much. We have been willing to ask ourselves some incredibly hard questions. We have confronted, and continue to confront our laws, our systems, our bureaucracy. And things are changing and will continue to change. But there are some things that lie outside the power of just politicians and governments. We all own and hold the power of words. We use them, we hear them, we respond to them.  How we choose to use this most powerful of tools is our choice.  There will be an unquestionable legacy from March 15. Much of it will be heart breaking. But it’s never too early or too late for the legacy to be a more inclusive nation, one that stands proud of our diversity, embraces it, and if called to, defends it stanchly. And for those moments, may I never, and may we never - be at a loss for words.Atamanaa lakum alsadaad    Shukran Lakum    "
2021-02-28T23:38:28Z,        Rino Tirikatene,  Speech to ANZLF Virtual Indigenous Business Trade and Connections Event ,"I acknowledge our whānau overseas, joining us from Te Whenua Moemoeā, and I wish to pay respects to their elders past, present, and emerging.Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you all today. I am very pleased to be part of the conversation on Indigenous business, and part of an event that facilitates relationship building between Aotearoa-New Zealand and Australian Indigenous businesses. I came in to my role at a time of great challenge for businesses. Against the backdrop of increasing threats to the global trading system and rising protectionism in our key markets, we now also face an uncertain headwind that none of us could have seen coming - COVID-19. The measures taken in response to the pandemic have hindered our ability to hono – connect -, in person. But I am encouraged by events like this, which acknowledge the importance of hononga – connections -, and facilitate the collaboration of Indigenous businesses across the Tasman. Connections put people in a position to work together to effect change at higher levels. Establishing relationship links between Māori and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island peoples allow us to share best practice approaches and learnings that benefit both our countries and improve the lives of our people.  I hope that the joint Australia and New Zealand indigenous business mission to South East Asia can be picked up again, once we are able to do so, to further strengthen indigenous connections internationally. Today’s event focuses on Indigenous Tourism. In Aotearoa, 17% of Māori employment is concentrated in the hospitality and tourism sector. The Māori tourism industry is significant, with over 537 Māori tourism businesses in Aotearoa, and a pre-covid GDP of just over $975 million.The impacts of COVID-19 are especially being felt in the tourism industry, with no international tourists and uncertainties around domestic travel. I have seen this first-hand in my own electorate where the tourism industry creates many jobs for Māori. These are tough times, but through investing in our people and businesses we can help indigenous tourism adapt and take advantage of the strong health responses of our countries.Indigenous partnerships have been at the forefront of this Government’s mind. You will have heard from Minister Mahuta and Minister Wyatt last week about the Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand Indigenous Collaboration Arrangement, and the role that plays in promoting indigenous peoples’ agency, culture, economy and well-being. Minister Mahuta asked me to continue this mahi – work - to help to position Māori to lead international efforts to expand the participation of indigenous people in global trade, including through the expansion of inclusive trade policies, rules and cooperation with our trade partners. Among participants in this event, there are large-scale Indigenous businesses, but there are also Small and Medium Enterprises. Trans-Tasman business connections are important for all businesses, but especially for those SMEs where often they look across the Tasman as a first venture in to the international market. One of the things that government can do to help is to improve our data and insights. Recent studies in Aotearoa have significantly improved our understanding of the scope of the Māori economy, Māori SMEs and entrepreneurship.The first of these was a study released by Te Puni Kōkiri, our Ministry of Māori Development called Te Matapaeroa 2019. It confirmed the existence of over 10,000 Māori-owned business, and 14,700 Māori sole traders across a wide number of goods and services sectors. It also confirmed what we all knew intuitively to be true - that Māori owned businesses employ more Māori, and in fact, at three times the rate of non-Māori businesses, which lifts our whānau—family- incomes and contributes to community well-being.Another recent study, Te Ōhanga Māori 2018, highlighted that from 2013 to 2018 the Māori population grew approximately four times the rate of non-Māori. This corresponds with a significant lift in the Māori working age population, and work force. Whilst Māori still suffer from relatively high and entrenched un-employment, there is a very positive story emerging around entrepreneurship, with the numbers of Māori self-employed increasing at five times the rate of non-Māori, and the rate of Māori employers increasing ten times more than non-Māori.I am hopeful that, in these numbers, we are starting to see the benefits of higher education and aspiring entrepreneurship re-emerge in our Maori economy. At the same time, we know that Māori business people still cite difficulty accessing business support from national and local government. I believe we have much to do to improve this, so we can respond to the aspiration from our rangatahi entrepreneurs. Small business growth is important, and we look approvingly towards the work that Australia has done on indigenous procurement and the impact that it has had. I understand, from your Supply Nation, that new SMEs are registering at truly impressive rates, and we intend to follow in your steps. Of course, domestic SME growth creates a platform for further development through exporting and trade. Trade is a critical part of Aotearoa-New Zealand and Australia’s joint economic recovery. The Honourable David Parker launched the Trade Recovery Strategy in June 2020, a strategy that helps to put New Zealand in the best possible position to recover from the impact of COVID-19. Part of this is recalibrating our trade policy to the new international environment.Underpinning the Trade Recovery Strategy is New Zealand’s Trade for All agenda. This initiative is an opportunity to consider trade policy in general, what we are currently doing, and making sure it delivers for all New Zealanders. Our goal with this is that will work alongside other government policies, to support sustainable and inclusive economic development.  New Zealand has also taken our hosting of APEC as an opportunity to further advance the inclusion of Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge, perspectives and experiences in the region’s trade and economic policy settings. One of the pou - core areas -, to progress this is through creating a platform for Indigenous connections internationally. New Zealand and Australian Trade Ministers met recently and are committed to meeting in person as soon as travel allows, to discuss trade and our joint economic recoveries.  In my role you can expect me to continue to champion international indigenous partnerships. I look forward to supporting the work of this Forum to lift opportunities for Māori businesses and engagement with Indigenous businesses in Australia.Thank you."
2021-02-26T00:51:41Z,        Hon Dr Megan Woods,  Speech to the National Māori Housing Conference 2021,"E te tī, e te tā Tēnei te mihi maioha ki a koutou Ki te whenua e takoto nei Ki te rangi e tū iho nei Ki a tātou e tau nei Tēnā tātou. It’s great to be with you today, along with some of the ministerial housing team; Hon Peeni Henare, the Minister in charge of Māori Housing, Hon Marama Davidson, who looks after the area of homelessness, and Hon Willie Jackson, on behalf of Māori development; and to hear so many of you talk about what is happening in Māori housing.Our commitment to working with you on tackling this critical issue for Māori is stronger than ever. It is many of you in this room who have the opportunity to re-shape and drive the future of Māori Housing – this will change what the statistics tell us – it is our job as Government to work with Māori to support and enable that. I don’t need to tell you about the long history that has taken us to the position we are in, in regard to Māori today; and equally I think we all appreciate it won’t be a short journey to change that course of history.This history is something that I have been personally interested in for many years – the dr part of my name comes from a PHD in NZ history – more specifically a study of Māori urbanisation during and after WWII, and the housing policies that facilitated one of the swiftest rural urban shifts in history. That study not only looked at the houses and the policies but also led me to talk to many young men who came from around here to Christchurch to learn their trade in the 1950s and 1960s and are still there today.What I learned from my research was that governments need to be deliberate in their housing policies – following the war PM Fraser and his Labour government saw a problem in a massive housing shortage but they also saw an opportunity to train a generation with skilled trades and to rapidly build the houses that were so badly needed. Now I am not about to get into a 15 minute speech about the politics of urbanisation but I do think there is much we can learn from the past – about what to do and what not to do. I also learned that housing is more than buildings, it’s about skills, jobs, place, wellbeing. Today I’m going to talk to you about some of the broader work that we have going on in housing, I’ll briefly touch on some of the specific approach we are taking through MAIHI and place-based work which will deliver better outcomes for Māori housing.A driving belief of our Government is that all New Zealanders should live in warm, dry, secure housing whether they own those homes or rent them.While home ownership remains a challenge in New Zealand, it is particularly so for whānau Māori. One of the ways we are supporting Māori into home ownership, is through the Progressive Home Ownership Fund.We have ring-fenced funding for Iwi and Māori and provider pathways. This $400m fund will help between 1,500 and 4,000 families into home ownershipIt’s for households who can afford mortgage payments but just can’t manage to save a deposit, or families who can get a small deposit together but are not able to afford the ongoing costs of a mortgage at current house prices. In short whanau shut out of home ownership. I’d like to thank all the Iwi and Māori organisations that have been working with Te Tūāpapa Kura Kainga for their early and continued engagement as we have worked through the design and delivery of the Fund. I’d particularly like to acknowledge the role that Te Matapihi has played to advocate for whānau Māori and help to ensure the Fund takes a Kaupapa Māori approach.  Since the Fund’s launch seven months ago, over 100 households and whānau are being pulled onto the path of home ownership, and around 50 households will be living in their own homes through PHO funding by June this year.12 families have already moved into their own new homes in Auckland.It was sad to see that this significant achievement was belittled earlier this week by people who appear not to understand the significant barriers some people face in making the transition from renter to homeowner. This is hard work, one whanau at a time.  This Labour Government is particularly proud of what we are doing in public and transitional housing.We are building more new public housing in a generation.When we came into government 3 years ago one of the jobs we had to tackle was to relearn how the state builds social housing and homes – after nearly a decade of inaction it was fair to say some of the muscle memory had been lost – we have been building on our public housing programme with every budget, to the point we are on track to deliver an extra 18,350 public and transitional housing places by 2024.The demand for public housing and emergency housing assistance continues to rise, driven by a range of interrelated factors including a shortage of housing, population increase, inadequate housing, homelessness, and insecurity of tenure. We have implemented a different approach to building housing; namely where it’s most needed and wanted, so Kāinga Ora is taking a place-based and MAIHI approach to focus on priority areas, such as here in Hastings. We need to build more public houses so people can move off the Housing Register, as quickly as possible. We are concentrating our efforts in regions where there is high need.Our Public Housing plan supports the delivery of solutions for Māori that align with MAIHI principles, to respond to whānau needs and aspirations.  We will continue to work alongside Iwi and Māori to advance housing projects that increase housing supply that attends to whānau needs, prevents homelessness, and improves Māori housing security.  Now, wearing my hat as both the Minister of Energy as well as Housing, a project I’m very interested in is the Māori and Public Housing Renewable Energy Fund.This has been established to trial small-scale renewable energy technologies for Māori houses.Renewable energy solutions can improve health outcomes for people in public and Māori housing, by reducing the cost of power bills for Māori whānau. We want to support renewable generation that consistently makes energy more affordable, so heating is used more, leading to warmer and healthier homes. I’ve talked a little already about our place-based work but would like to let you more about why we are working this way.We know that some communities are harder hit than others by rising housing prices.  We also know that every community has its own aspirations for its future. So we cannot take a one-size-fits-all approach to housing and urban development.  A place-based means we work in partnership with communities to achieve these aspirations and take a close look at what the barriers are to achieving them, and options to overcome them.It means we respond to what we learn with the right policies, so that all communities have the tools they need to succeed. Our partnerships in Hastings and Rotorua have taught us the value of this approach. In both places we are working with iwi, local government, and the private sector to tackle long standing housing and urban issues in an enduring way. Alongside these, our urban growth partnerships are supporting high growth urban areas to develop in ways that best meet their needs. Partnerships between local government, central government and iwi are in place for Auckland, the Hamilton-Auckland Corridor and Tauranga-Western Bay of Plenty. We are also progressing spatial plans in the Hamilton-Metro, Tauranga Western-Bay of Plenty, Wellington-Horowhenua and Queenstown Lakes areas.  Our kaupapa Māori (Te Maihi o te Whare Māori) approach and our place-based approach is proving the foundation for the Government’s work in housing. We expect to see more bespoke responses to different housing needs, especially for Māori.  For example, the recently released Public Housing Plan will deliver more new public housing in regional centres and towns where housing demand is growing fastest, alongside delivery in main centres. Delivery will be collaborative, working with iwi, Māori Community Housing Providers, and others in the community to deliver solutions that meet the immediate and long-term needs and aspirations of vulnerable individuals, whānau and communities. The Government is working on the development of a Government Policy Statement on Housing and Urban Development (GPS-HUD), to form Kāinga Ora’s strategic direction that it needs to perform its very significant role in our housing and urban system.But the value of the GPS goes well beyond its role in guiding the activities of Kāinga Ora.Importantly, we see the GPS playing a critical role in agreeing and sharing a long-term vision for housing and urban development, to help build consensus on what New Zealand wants for the future, and to help align everyone across the system to help get us there.In particular, the GPS will reflect the principles of partnership, participation, and protection, which underpin the relationship between the Government and Māori under Te Tiriti o Waitangi.  We recognised quite early on that developing a GPS that is enduring and meets the needs and aspirations of Iwi, Māori and all of our partners requires good engagement, with opportunities to help shape the direction.Last year my officials held a series of online hui with partners and stakeholders to get early views on what the GPS should contain – thank you to many of you who attended to share your perspectives.My officials are taking what we heard through those workshops — together with the rich information and perspectives that we have heard through engagement at the MAIHI Whare Wananga and through the various Te Pou Tahua - Iwi Chair Forums, and the Housing Policy and Services Kaupapa Inquiry (WAI 2750) — and are starting to give shape to a draft GPS.  There are two aspects of the GPS that I want to share with you now.The first aspect is that — alongside a clear vision and outcomes — it will contain around six key priorities. These will focus on New Zealand’s fundamental needs, such as: helping our most vulnerable; providing affordable, healthy, and secure housing options that meet all needs; and shaping resilient, inclusive, sustainable, and prosperous communities.Importantly, it will include delivering solutions that are tailored and enduring for Māori needs and aspirations and aligned with the MAIHI includes, reviewing and resetting the system so that future policy provide for equitable outcomes for Māori.The second aspect is that it will outline key shifts in the way we want the housing and urban development system to work, including the role of government. These will include embedding a place-based approach, building genuine and enduring relationships (and through that build capability across the system), and partnering with Māori to bring innovation and leadership to design and implement solutions with Māori, by Māori for Māori. Māori make up a significant portion of the number of people who rent in New Zealand. The Government delivered on its promise to reform rental laws to better reflect the modern-day rental environment. New tenancy rules came into effect in February this year.The reform was a significant and necessary change to the tenancy laws in New Zealand. A key focus of this reform was improving security of tenure for tenants.Access to secure and sustainable housing has positive education, health, and wellbeing outcomes for children. Looking forward, we will see tenants and their communities experiencing the benefits of the reform.The new tenancy laws will enable tenants to put down roots in their communities and make their house a home. The reforms strike the right balance between tenant’s and landlord’s interests.  You will know that we have committed to reform the Resource Management Act following a review. The RMA is a hugely important piece of legislation because it not only manages our interactions with the environment, including our taonga, it also governs what can be built where, when, and how. But it’s not delivering the outcomes we want. Our urban areas have struggled to keep pace with population growth and the need for affordable housing, with devastating consequences for our most disadvantaged communities. Water quality is deteriorating, biodiversity is diminishing and there is an urgent need to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to climate change. Māori and iwi have been insufficiently involved or engaged with in decision-making. In short, the RMA has failed to enable the housing we need, has failed to protect the environmental and cultural values we cherish, and has failed to support Māori housing aspirations. We need a resource management system that works for all New Zealanders and enables our cities to grow and change, and that is responsive to the changing needs and demands of our diverse and growing populations. Finally, it’s important to note that the resource management system, while foundational, is only one important piece of the puzzle. The resource management system plans and enables housing, but it does not build houses. Addressing our housing issues requires a multi-pronged approach that combines a responsive resource management system with more direct housing policies and solutions, including policies that that are effectively targeted to the needs and aspirations of Māori. While our resource management laws will get an overhaul, and it will take some time, we have already implemented legislation that will tackle our restrictive planning rules that make it harder for people to build and live in the homes they want, where they want. The National Policy Statement - Urban Development’s aim is to ensure that New Zealand’s towns and cities are well-functioning urban environments that meet the changing needs of our diverse communities.The NPS-UD requires council plans to plan well for growth – both upwards and outwards. To do this, councils are directed to open up development capacity so more homes can be built in response to demand.This will enable a significant shift towards higher density and more intensification in areas where people want to live and that are well connected to jobs, public transport, community facilities and green spaces. We recognise the importance of the timely implementation of the NPS-UD and the Government has high expectations that councils will implement it as soon as possible, so more housing is delivered quicker and it’s more affordable. The Government sees this, alongside longer-term RMA reform, as a critical way the planning system can contribute to improving housing affordability in our major cities. Under the NPS- UD councils are required to ensure urban development occurs in a way that takes into account the principles of Te Tiriti O Waitangi. Through planning under the NPS-UD, local authorities are required to provide housing for Māori that meets their individual needs. To enable this, they must engage with tangata whenua to determine appropriate methods for incorporating values and aspirations of all Māori living in their urban environment.The NPS-UD also assists local authorities to fulfil their existing obligations by emphasising existing requirements in the RMA for engaging with Māori. The Future Development Strategy, developed under the NPS-UD, will require certain councils to carry out long-term planning to demonstrate how they will accommodate growth and ensure a well-functioning urban environment. The NPS-UD requires that each FDS be informed by the values and aspirations of hapū and iwi as well s Māori that do not hold mana whenua over the urban environment in which they live. The housing and urban systems clearly need to deliver more homes and support communities and local economies with jobs, education, and services.Māori bring an important perspective to these important conversations about the role housing plays in community well-being and whānau development – providing a holistic perspective that understands the multiple, complex, and overlapping nature of issues and potential solutions. Enabling whānau and hapu to create communities centred around whenua Māori creates a platform for wider community development that the housing system can learn from; this has initially been nurtured by the Māori Housing Network in Te Puni Kōkiri but increasingly we are seeing government agencies like Te Tūāpapa Kura Kainga (HUD) and Kāinga Ora leverage this knowledge.As we move forwards with Kāinga Ora’s urban work programme, we will increasingly discover that in many of our larger urban areas that are land poor, through Right of First Refusal land, Māori are comparatively land rich.Our aim is to unlock the potential of Māori land, for whānau to have access to reconnect to their whenua, to build and contribute to their communities.    Ka nui aku mihi maioha ki a koutou Ki tēnei kaupapa mahurangi  Mauri ora ki te whare Tēnā koutou katoa "
2021-02-24T00:31:20Z,        Hon Willie Jackson,  Ahuwhenua Trophy Competition Finalist Announcement,"Kia hiwa rā! Kia hiwa rā! He hikinga manawa, he koanga ngākau – tēnā rā tātou katoa.It is my pleasure to be able to welcome you all here today for the announcement of the finalists of the Ahuwhenua Trophy competition.My colleague Hon Damien O’Connor, the Minister for Agriculture, will announce the finalists shortly.I know you are all eagerly awaiting that announcement, so I will be brief in my welcome.These awards are the most prestigious Māori farming awards in the world and Māori agribusiness is a powerful driver in the New Zealand economy.Profits for Māori authority farming businesses reached $97 million in 2018, which is almost twice the 2017 figures.  On average, Māori farms have four times more land than the average New Zealand farm.This land is used in many ways. Last year horticulture was introduced into the awards. This shows the land use innovation that is still possible and how far we have come in Aotearoa in the farming sector.Māori are diversifying into new areas including nut, honey and kiwifruit production.The focus for this year’s competition is dairy and Māori dairy is a big business in Aotearoa.Māori dairy farmers own an estimated 100 million shares in Fonterra with some of the major players in the sector being large incorporations. Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, the outlook for Māori-owned farms is strong. But Māori agribusiness is so much more than just an economic force. The concept of kaitiakitanga is more relevant than ever.Our traditional values pre-date contemporary needs and the emerging focus on sustainable practices. The Māori dairy farmers we celebrate through the Ahuwhenua Trophy walk tall in both worlds.As Minister for Māori Development, my role is to ensure whānau Māori landowners are supported to fulfill their aspirations for their whenua.This also includes the sustainable development of their land. The Ahuwhenua Trophy provides a premium stage to showcase whānau-led models in the agricultural and horticultural sectors. All are shining examples of Māori success.Success for Māori is success for all New Zealand – it lifts everyone. It is also why this Government is right behind supporting whānau in their whenua aspirations.Targeted amendments to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act took effect on Waitangi Day this year.The practical and technical changes made, relating to succession, dispute resolution and related matters, will ensure the legislation works better.These amendments will also support the Māori Land Court to operate effectively.Last year, Te Puni Kōkiri launched tupu.nz, the whenua knowledge website. It is a fantastic resource to help landowners of whenua Māori navigate their way through what can be a complicated journey to utilise their whenua.  This includes providing good information about Māori freehold land investment opportunities.It can also help all Māori landowners to make important decisions about their whenua.This kete of knowledge complements other whenua Māori-related services provided by Te Puni Kōkiri.Services, such as the on-the-ground advisory support in some regions.Last year my predecessor in this portfolio, Hon Nanaia Mahuta, announced a package of changes to the Local Government (Rating) Act.Changes that would remove some of the barriers to using and developing Māori land. There are other challenges to overcome and mazes to navigate to unlock the full and rich social, cultural and economic potential of our whenua.I believe the changes that this government and I have made remove some of the long-standing barriers.This will enable whānau, hapū and Iwi development through their whenua.Toitū te whenua, toitū te tangata.Nō reira, tēnā tātou katoa.

2021-02-21T22:39:59Z,        Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern,  Speech to National Remembrance Service on the 10th anniversary of the Christchurch earthquake ,"Tena koutou e nga Maata WakaNgai Tuahuriri, Ngai Tahu whanui, Tena koutou.Nau mai whakatau mai ki tenei ra maumahara i te Ru WhenuaApiti hono tatai hono, Te hunga mate ki te hunga mateApiti hono tatai hono, Te hunga ora ki te hunga oraTena koutou, Tena koutou,Tena tatou katoaToday marks a decade since the February 22nd earthquake and the tragic loss of 185 lives.It is a chance for us all to remember those people, and stand with the families, loved ones and friends who grieve them. In some respects, 10 years sounds a long time. But for many it will feel like just yesterday that Christchurch, and indeed New Zealand, was rocked by the events of February 22nd. The earthquake and aftershocks affected people in complex and diverse ways. The toll could not have been more significant, and daily reminders made it harder – a fractured landscape, aftershocks, struggling friends and neighbours, and children with deep and unseen scars.Ten years on there will be people still living their daily lives with the long shadow of that day. Today I want to take the opportunity to say to all those who may still feel overwhelmed, uncertain, sad, tired or anxious - you survived an event which by rights should not occur in anyone’s lifetime. I hope you find the space to be kind to yourself, as you’ve no doubt been to others who you knew were carrying the same burden.To those who lost loved ones, the grief has been even more immense.Today we not only mark the loss of 185 lives, but we remember and celebrate those people - the joy they gave, the memories made, the lives they lived.Haere haere, haere atu ra. I remember so clearly how the country threw its support behind Canterbury in the months and years following the quake, raising funds, holding tributes, downing tools during moments of silence. We all felt so keenly the enormity of what had happened. It’s the kiwi way to be stoic, and sometimes the pressure to “be okay” or to have “moved on” with the passage of time can feel very pronounced. But healing takes time, and even as time has passed, none of us will forget. I want to acknowledge all past and present members of the Quake Families Trust, which has provided such significant support over the last decade, and helped shape the annual commemorations.I want to acknowledge all those who were part of relief efforts on or after February 22 - emergency service staff, the Christchurch mayor and city councillors, ministers, international diplomats and family and friends of all involved.And I’d like to acknowledge the children who lived through the earthquake and grew up in its aftermath. Some of these children will be teenagers now, or have left school and started jobs or university.I have in the past called this the generation of the rebuild.But they are also the generation that will create a legacy. Here in Canterbury you saw the impact of a natural disaster on children, and professionals across Canterbury – educationalists, mental health specialists, occupational therapists, social workers – all came together to design a programme to support those children. You made an enormous difference and now that programme will now be rolled out across New Zealand. Out of such a traumatic time for our kids I hope grows a form of comfort and support for a whole generation. And finally today, we remember that 87 of the people who died in the earthquake were foreign nationals.  The families of these 87 may not have been able to be here today due to travel restrictions. Our flags fly at half-mast for them today too.It’s been a hugely difficult decade for this city - at times I’m sure it’s felt impossible. But as we look ahead to the coming decade, I see hope and energy and optimism, and I see Christchurch taking its rightful place amongst New Zealand’s best and brightest cities.I’d like to finish today with an excerpt from a poem by Helen Lowe, from Leaving the Red Zone, an anthology of Earthquake poetry. The poem, titled The Sparrows, talks about how birds were absent in the city following the earthquake, and the silence where birdsong used to be.“I threw old bread onto the island of grass in our own grey sea and waited….and waited.And then, finally, they cameTheir wings clouding the sun.”"
2021-02-16T20:51:04Z,        Rino Tirikatene,  Supporting Māori to Succeed in Trade - International Inter-Tribal Trade and Investment Organization (IITIO) (Virtual) Event,"Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. This is a special time in our country. A little over a week ago, it was the anniversary of the signature by Māori and the British Crown of Te Tiriti O Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi), a founding document in the history of Aotearoa New Zealand. Since then, much has of course changed, not least how we trade, and who we trade with. The Māori economy has, and continues to adjust to these winds of change and we as the Government continue to work hard to ensure that there are opportunities through international trade that match the significant aspiration and potential that exists in the Māori economy.  The Māori economy today is valued at around $70 billion and is a hugely important contributor to New Zealand’s trade and economic well-being. One in four jobs in New Zealand depend on trade, and many iwi (tribes), hapu (subtribes) and whānau (extended families) are directly involved in, or supported by, export industries.  The New Zealand Government recognises that creating opportunities for New Zealand businesses internationally will always be a critical driver of Māori economic success and this is, therefore, at the heart of the Government’s trade agenda.In 2019, then Associate Minister for Trade and Export Growth, Nanaia Mahuta (who is now our Foreign Minister), established a programme of work designed to support Māori Trade Opportunities: Aotearoa ki te Ao.  Its four strategic pou (pillars) are designed to ensure trade policy helps Māori succeed internationally. The Prime Minister has asked me to now continue our work to help to position Māori to lead international efforts to expand the participation of indigenous people in global trade, including through the expansion of inclusive trade policies, rules and co-operation with our trade partners.New Zealand has worked to develop a number of plurilateral initiatives on inclusive trade with like-minded partners to take these goals forward. Alongside Canada and Chile, we are members of the Inclusive Trade Action Group (ITAG) which specifically involves work to advance indigenous trade issues. Last year our three countries concluded the Global Trade and Gender Arrangement, which further promotes women’s economic empowerment, including that of mana wahine – a term which speaks to the unique power and spiritual essence of women. We also concluded the Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand Indigenous Collaboration Arrangement, which seeks to promote broad cooperation on issues related to indigenous peoples and includes – but goes beyond – trade and economic matters. This area of work – trade and indigenous cooperation – will be an important focus for New Zealand going forward and we are reflecting on how to further advance this, including through our hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation - APEC - in 2021. Connections to global markets for products and services are essential for Māori trade success, and pursuing an ambitious agenda of free trade agreements is a priority for New Zealand. Our goal is that these free trade agreements provide opportunities for Māori, and reflect the special relationship between Māori and the Crown. In order to do this, we are enhancing our research into Māori trade opportunities, to ensure that our negotiators are aware of – and therefore able to pursue – those things that matter most to the Māori economy. Furthermore, New Zealand’s free trade agreements contain a Treaty of Waitangi exception clause which, combined with other provisions, protects the government’s ability to adopt policies that fulfil its obligations to Māori, including under the Treaty of Waitangi.We have also recently signed a Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) with the ten members of ASEAN plus four other regional countries with which ASEAN has FTAs. RECEP anchors New Zealand in a region that is the engine room of the global economy. The 15 RCEP economies are home to almost a third of the world’s population and the agreement is projected to add $186 billion to the world economy and increase New Zealand’s GDP by around $2.0 billion. Similarly, we also recently signed an upgrade to our FTA with China, which sees a vast expansion of provisions originally negotiated in 2008 including improved market access while protecting our exporters’ future competitive positioning by allowing them to automatically benefit should China make new commitments to other countries in specific service sectors.Last month, the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement between New Zealand, Singapore and Chile came into force, demonstrating the value we place on the digital economy and our strong focus on continuing to support Māori businesses to move up the value chain.  There is high interest by other trading partners in joining this young Agreement.Alongside our critical commercial interests, New Zealand’s trade agenda is also focused on recognising kaupapa (principles or ideals) that are culturally important to Māori.  The Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability (the ACCTS) unites a group of small, trade-dependent countries who believe trade measures and disciplines can make a contribution by helping to address the urgent climate crisis we are facing.   We have just undertaken the third round of negotiations towards this new Agreement, which continue despite the inability of our teams to meet in person.All of the extensive work that I have described to advance Māori interests in international trade, economic and values issues is underpinned by our Government’s ‘Trade for All’ agenda. Trade for All is about ensuring trade policy recognises and respects those things that are important to New Zealanders and that shares the benefits of trade more widely.  It is also a trade policy that fundamentally recognises the role of Māori in our trade policy. A central plank of Trade for All is continuing to work more closely with our treaty partners to ensure that Te Ao Māori, Tikanga Māori, and Matauranga Māori are reflected in our trade policy direction; that the strength of the Māori economy and its trade and investment potential are supported, and that trade delivers for Māori. Trade for All has prioritised enhancing our engagement with Māori. In September 2019, MFAT signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with ‘Te Taumata’, a group of recognised leaders in Māori socio-economic and cultural development areas with significant networks across Māoridom.  This relationship enables MFAT’s to intensify its engagement with Māori on trade policy and deepen its understanding of Māori priorities within trade..This complements MFAT’s existing structured engagement with Māori and reflects our shared motivation to uphold Te Tiriti’s underlying principle of partnership. To date, Te Taumata has held a number a regional hui (meetings) on a wide range of topics.In 2020, following the recommendations of the Trade for All Board, we significantly expanded the pace and nature of our engagement on trade with the public.  Trade officials in New Zealand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) undertook 280 separate pieces of engagement on trade issues last year, stepping up rather than stepping back from engagement right through lockdown and in the months following.  A comprehensive plan to engage with Māori on our current FTA negotiations with the UK was launched last year – complementing existing strategies developed when we began FTA negotiations with the EU in 2018 – and involving multiple Government agencies. A range of detailed discussions were held with a number of Māori groups and representatives on their interests in a NZ-UK FTA, including on issues such as intellectual property and trade and the environment, and several webinars relevant to a Māori audience were hosted by trade negotiators . The establishment of a new consultative mechanism, named Ngā Toki Whakarururanga, was agreed to with a group of Māori claimants to our Waitangi Tribunal. This mechanism gives a further voice for Māori, in addition to the existing arrangement with Te Taumata. Despite the urgency with which the Government needed to act to manage the immediate impacts of COVID-19, the principles of Trade for All underpinned the development of new initiatives and policies and the communication of those to the public, including, mostly recently, the Trade Recovery Strategy.Launched in June 2020, the Trade Recovery Strategy helps put New Zealand in the best possible position to recover from the impacts of the global pandemic and to seize new opportunities for exports and investment. During the height of the pandemic, the focus has been on protecting trade flows and supply chains to ensure that New Zealanders can access essential goods like medicines and PPE, and that our goods continue to reach our trading partners.  Māori are more likely to be hit first, hardest and longest because of over-representation in industries that are vulnerable to boom and bust, like construction and international tourism.  The next phase of New Zealand’s response is recalibrating our trade policy for a new international environment.  The Government is working closely with exporters to ensure the strategy reflects their needs and priorities.The strategy has four pillars: retooling support for exporters; reinvigorating international trade architecture; refreshing key trade relationships and building NZ’s strategic economic resilience. These four inter-related components are underpinned by the Trade for All agenda, as New Zealand responds to the social and economic well-being impacts of COVID-19.  These are no doubt challenging times. The global health and economic consequences of COVID-19 will be with us for some time yet and New Zealand will not be immune. As a trading nation we rely on international customers to purchase our goods and services. This Government is committed to partnering with Māori in a manner which positions New Zealand globally as an attractive place to trade with and invest in, and supports the trade aspirations of Māori across the economy.I look forward to supporting this work to lift opportunities for Māori – and indigenous peoples throughout the world – and to continue to grow the voice of Māori in the development of Aotearoa New Zealand’s international trade agenda."
2021-02-14T07:59:00Z,        Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern,  Prime Minister’s statement on alert level changes,"Good eveningCabinet has met this evening to make decisions on our response to the three cases reported earlier within a household in Auckland.Shortly I will ask Dr Bloomfield to set out some further information we now have relating to these cases.New Zealanders have enjoyed more freedoms for longer periods of time than nearly any other country in the world. And we have never taken for granted how special that was.But with Covid raging outside our borders, and new more transmissible strains emerging, we have had to both make continual improvements to strengthen our border while continuing to plan and prepare for managing any resurgence in the most effective way possible.Cabinet’s plan is based on the best science and what we know works from previous cases here and responses overseas. I will pass to Dr Bloomfield who will provide an update on the cases then I will set out the initial decisions that have been made in response, and what it means for everyone.Dr Bloomfield———These new cases pose questions our public health staff are working around the clock to answer.We don’t yet have a complete picture of the potential source of the infection and spread, if any, beyond one household and we are waiting for the genome sequencing and serology which will provide important pieces of the puzzle.Regardless Cabinet has chosen to respond with a cautious approach that has served us so well previously and with the working assumption it could be one of the new more transmissible strains of Covid that we need to act with a high degree of caution to.The most important lessons we’ve learned from the times we have stamped out flare ups and from cases overseas where outbreaks have gotten away is the need to go hard and go early to avoid the risk of a wider outbreak and longer periods of restrictions.In line with this precautionary approach that has served us so well to date, cabinet have made the following decisions.As of 11.59pm tonight, Sunday February 14 Auckland will move to Level 3 for a period of 3 days, until midnight on Wednesday.The rest of New Zealand will move to Level 2 for the same period.This will be reviewed on a 24 hour basis and we will provide daily updates.Three days will give us time to gather further information, undertake large scale testing, and establish if there has been wider community transmission.Let me set out what that means for Aucklanders and the rest of New Zealand.The levels remain the same as you will recall from August.That means the main thing we are asking people in Auckland to do is to stay home to avoid any risk of spread.That means staying in your bubble other than for essential personal movement.People should work from home unless that is not possible.If you go outside your home maintain physical distancing of 2 metres outside, or 1 metre in controlled environments where you know the others present.We are asking children to stay home from school. But you will remember, that in Level three Schools (years 1 to 10) and Early Childhood Education centres can open for children whose parents need to be at work.Supermarkets, pharmacies, primary produce retailers, and petrol stations can remain open. So once again, no need to rush out this evening to any of these places. But we are again asking all other businesses that usually interact face to face with customers to move to non-contact methods – click and collect, or online ordering.The main rule here is maintaining physical distancing between staff and not physically interacting with customers.Public venues will be closed. For example, libraries, museums, cinemas, food courts, gyms, pools, playgrounds, markets.Gatherings outside of your bubble are prohibited, with the exception of groups of 10 for wedding services, funerals and tangihanga. Physical distancing and public health measures legally must be maintained at those events.Healthcare services will revert to using virtual, non-contact consultations where possible.Inter-regional travel will be highly limited – for example people can go home if they are in Auckland and that is not their place of residence, and vice versa. Mask wearing on planes, trains, buses, ferries and in taxies will be required. But a border will be put in place in Auckland.The border will be broadly similar to last time Auckland was at Level 3, but improvements have been made based on that experience. Those who need to travel through the border can go to the MBIE website.People at high risk of severe illness, such as older people and those with existing medical conditions, are encouraged to stay at home where possible, and take additional precautions when leaving home.If you are in Auckland we ask that you use a face covering if you need to leave your home.That brings me to what Level 2 means for the rest of New Zealand.We will be moving the rest of the country, outside of Auckland, to Level two. This will also come into place midnight tonight, and run through till midnight on Wednesday, so the same period of time that we have moved Auckland.Businesses and schools remain open but public health guidance including physical distancing and record keeping need to be maintained. Alternative ways of working are encouraged where possible.There is compulsory mask wearing on public transport and again you are encouraged to wear masks where you cannot maintain physical distancing.  Mass gatherings will need to be limited to 100 people.Hospitality businesses must keep groups of customers separated, seated, and served by a single person with a maximum of 100 people at a time.We have stamped out the virus before and we can do it again. We have a plan that works and our team of 5 million has shown time and again our ability to stick together to keep Covid out and keep each other safe.Before I finish I want to talk about some of the health plans we have in place.Auckland health officials will be expanding the testing capacity across the Auckland region. They will seek to test thousands of people over the coming days in order to understand any potential cases in the community.It’s our intention to test students, staff and members of the school community from Papatoetoe High School.We will also be testing all workers at LSG Sky Chefs where one of the cases worked. We will also be undertaking wide testing of those who are symptomatic in Auckland.  We ask anyone who is experiencing cold or flu symptoms to get tested. If you are well, and have not visited any places of interest – you do not need to be tested. Well people take up space in the testing queue and can slow down our ability to get a handle on the risk of spread.Testing centre hours across Auckland have been extended in response to the new community cases.Testing centres across Auckland reported strong demand for testing this afternoon. All testing locations in Auckland are available on the Auckland Regional Public Health Service website and on Healthpoint and at covid19.govt.nz   Finally I’m asking New Zealanders to continue to be strong and be kind. I know we all feel the same way when this happens – not again.But remember, we have been here before, that means we know how to get out of this – together.If you know someone in Auckland, give them a call.If you are in Auckland, please make sure that your neighbours and ensure they are looked after and supported. And do tell them, it is going to be ok."
2021-02-11T21:33:07Z,        Hon Grant Robertson,  Prepared speech notes for LGNZ Metro Sector Meeting,"GreetingsI’ve gotten to know many of you over the past three years as Finance Minister. I have really valued the engagement and connections with local government, especially on infrastructure because we know that with the right investments we really will make a difference for New Zealanders.Would like to introduce myself in my new Cabinet role – Infrastructure Minister.The Prime Minister has given me clear instructions as Finance Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, to lead the economic group of Ministers and to accelerate our recovery and rebuild.In that context it makes sense for me to take on the Infrastructure portfolio.  We all know how critical the right mix and level of infrastructure investment will be to our recovery.In fact the role of infrastructure in delivering our wellbeing agenda is not always well appreciated.  In all four capitals of our Living Standards Framework quality infrastructure is an essential factor. I see three main jobs for me to get on with as Infrastructure MinisterTo make sure the settings are right and the pipeline clear to allow for increased infrastructure development and investment.To make sure that key projects across Government are being delivered.That we’re working with all partners, in particular local government, iwi and the private sector to develop new opportunities.I have a strong team of economic Ministers who’ll be focussed on their individual portfolios for infrastructure: Andrew Little in Health, Chris Hipkins in Education, the new Transport Minister, Michael Wood, Megan Woods in Housing, and your Minister Nanaia Mahuta in Local Government.Under those Ministers, we have the majority of the $42 billion of infrastructure investments that are booked and planned for the next four years – on top of the $25 billion of infrastructure investment made over the previous three years.My job is to ensure that what we say we’ll build – we’ll build.  As part of that role we will lead out of my office a team which liaises with the Treasury and the Prime Minister’s office to have an oversight of delivery of our key goals, including in infrastructure. I know Infrastructure - and how we fund it - is top of mind for you as leaders in local government too. There are already some tools in place that I want to urge you to participate in – Infrastructure CommissionYou’ll all be aware of the work that the Infrastructure Commission is doing creating a 30 year infrastructure strategy for New Zealand. The Commission’s work will prove invaluable, and I urge you to be as involved as possible in their process. Local government voice is absolutely crucial in this. We have an opportunity to get this right.  Infrastructure Funding and Financing ActI think the IFF has enormous potential to enable greater investment in infrastructure development. But it is going to require levels of partnership, creativity and innovation that we have not seen before to make it workThis is the mechanism to create SPVs to leverage the input of Government, Council and private sector investments while taking debt off Crown and Council balance sheets.Using an SPV can ensure long-term debt financing is available to developers willing to build trunk infrastructure financed over a longer term, rather than – to take housing as an example – having to line up up-front purchase price of new homes to get a development underway.It allows costs to be paid off over the life of an asset – rather than having to be included in the upfront cost like the sale price of a house. As Minister for Infrastructure I will be responsible for making the decisions of whether a levy can be charged for new infrastructure.Once I receive a recommendation that a project developer wants to use the mechanisms under the Act, CIP – as the ‘facilitator’ will carry out the work required to assess the proposal and I will agree to and Order in Council for it to progress.Many of you will be aware of the Milldale development. This was CIP’s first infrastructure financing transaction back in 2018. Under the new law, projects are able to follow a similar model, but with the ability to apply a statutory charge to spread out the cost of the development over time.CIP is currently focussed on the potential of a number of other urban development projects: Drury in South Auckland, Rotokauri in Hamilton, and Tauriko – West Tauranga.So we are looking for more of this. I urge you to think about whether your projects are right for this financing. It will require all parties to trust one another, and to take a leap of faith into a new funding arrangement.  We are ready and willing to do that. Fast track consentingI encourage local government to consider the fast track consenting process for your projects. This is an excellent opportunity to bring projects forward. The Ministry for the Environment is running these, so please be in touch with them if you’d like to know more. Thank you also to those councils who have assisted in this process by commenting on applications fast tracking. This is a critical part of the process and local knowledge is vital to the Minister’s decision making. Infrastructure Reference Group (IRG) shovel-ready programmeThe Government has now announced 170 projects representing $2,6bn of government funding and $4.6bn in total project value across the country. Local government has been a major direct beneficiary of this programme, with over $750m in funding going towards Council projects so far, with $1,2b in total project value. Further projects will be announced as the remaining due diligence and negotiations are completed by CIP. RMA reformYou will have heard David Parker’s announcement on Wednesday about our Government’s plan for RMA reform. All of us recognise that the RMA has not adequately protected the natural environment or enabled the development we need – especially in urban areas. Following the Randerson Review last term, we’ve announced that the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) will be repealed and replaced with new laws this parliamentary termNatural and Built Environments Act (NBA) to provide for land use and environmental regulation (this would be the primary replacement for the RMA)Strategic Planning Act (SPA) to integrate with other legislation relevant to development, and require long-term regional spatial strategiesClimate Change Adaptation Act (CAA) to address complex issues associated with managed retreat and funding and financing adaptation. The new laws will improve the natural environment, enable more development within environmental limits, provide an effective role for Māori, and improve housing supply and affordability.I know you will be delighted to hear that planning processes will be simplified and costs and times reduced. For example, one of the proposals is to provide for a single planning document for each region under the NBA. This will consolidate over 100 existing regional and district planning documents into about 14 – and provisionally called Natural and Built Environments Plans.The complete NBA and the SPA will be formally introduced into Parliament by the end of 2021, with the NBA passed by the end of 2022.Again, local government engagement is crucial. Cabinet has directed officials to engage with you on that. HousingIn regards to housing, there are some critical tools we created in our first term to boost housing supply, including the National Policy Statement – Urban Development or NPS-UD. The NPS-UD directs local councils to plan better for growth and to enable more intensification in urban areas, with affordable housing that is well-connected to jobs, public transport, community facilities and green spaces Central Government alone cannot fix the housing crisis; New Zealand needs local councils to use the NPS-UD to help increase the supply of new and affordable housing by lowering barriers to housing development. We appreciate it is a sizeable task. But given the magnitude of the housing crisis it is both necessary and urgent to do what can and should be done, to encourage more housing to be built. I understand that councils have begun the process of implementation. This includes removing minimum car-parking rules, which make development more expensive. This is great to see and I look forward to further progress.The NPS-UD will be pivotal as the Government progresses RMA reform, which should cement in the changes enabled through the NPS-UD.  Climate ChangeThrough the NPS-UD, councils are also directed to give greater consideration to climate change, along with access and housing affordability, when pulling together their plans. They also have to help ensure more people live in areas with good public and active transport links, which will help more people leave the car at home, freeing up our roads and reducing emissions. On top of this, Waka Kotahi along with local councils, now has to consider how each and every transport investment they make contributes to tackling climate change thanks to the Government Policy Statement on land transport 2021. Please keep this in mind when you all are putting together your Regional Land Transport Plans as reducing emissions will be a key focus for investment decisions, alongside saving lives on the road, better transport choices to unclog our cities, moving freight more efficiently to support business.Three waters ReformLast year, the Government provided $523.1 million in stimulus funding for councils to invest in three waters service delivery and infrastructure. This was supplemented by a further $117.3 million in local government co-funding, bringing the total value of three waters investment to $640.4 million. By December last year, all councils had received an initial 50 percent allocation of Crown funding so that critical works could get underway. I’m pleased to hear that this money is already being put to good use towards projects that enhance public health, improve environmental outcomes, improve service levels and resilience, extend service provision, address deferred maintenance and renewals, and accommodate and enable growth. Significantly, these works are expected to generate approximately 1,900 jobs across New Zealand. Further funding from the three waters package will be released to councils over the next 12 months as project milestones are reached. I want to thank local government for the constructive approach you have taken to providing the complex and detailed information on the state of council water assets and services through the Three Waters Reform Programme’s Request for Information. I know it is a big task for you but I believe the time is now to try to sort this issue out as much as we canFar-reaching change to essential services, such as drinking water wastewater and stormwater networks, needs to be based on the best possible knowledge base – and the RfI will greatly assist us in making the right decisions as we go forward on these transformational reforms. The proposal to create a small number of publicly-owned multi-regional water entities with balance sheet separation from councils will enable the advantages of scale, and more advantageous borrowing terms to fund infrastructure and services. At the same time, it will create debt headroom for councils to invest in otherwise in their communities. I know there is concern in some quarters about the potential impact on councils of such significant reform. Our government is committed to strong, robust and effective local democracy – and I know that my colleague the Minister of Local Government has work underway, alongside initiatives by LGNZ and Taituarā, on the future of local government. I’m sure you will be hearing more about this soon. ConclusionCentral and local government have always had strong relationships in building infrastructure for NZ. If we want to build back better, we need to ensure those relationships are even stronger. We need to do this together. "
2021-02-11T03:06:10Z,        Hon Dr Megan Woods,  Speech to Business Energy Council breakfast,"Thank you very much for providing me the opportunity to speak at the Business New Zealand Energy Council breakfast meeting again. I always look forward to this event, and I am pleased to update you on the priorities for this Government in the Energy and Resources portfolio. This is the third year I have been before you, outlining our priorities and my work programme for the coming year.Thank you, David, for the introduction. I’d also like to thank Neal [Barclay] from Meridian for hosting us this morning and Tina [Schirr] from BEC. It’s fair to say a lot has happened since I was here a year ago. Thank you for the critical parts you have all played to get us through. You literally kept the lights on – and industry running where possible.As we move into 2021, dealing with COVID-19 continues to be a priority for our Government.Keeping the virus out, and New Zealanders safe is front and centre for us.But so is how we rebuild and recover from the impacts of the pandemic; recognising the need to build a more resilient, fairer and sustainable future for all New Zealanders.COVID-19 has caused many to reflect on whether to accept the status quo, or step up to the change we really need.Our Government understands that the economic recovery from COVID-19 provides an opportunity to address some of the long-standing sustainability and environmental challenges facing Aotearoa New Zealand, including the serious threat of climate change. Our support for a strong and speedy economic recovery must be inclusive, it must be productive, and it must push us further - and faster - toward our climate change goals.We are committed to paving the way toward more low-emission technologies and the infrastructure needed for a 21st century New Zealand. I want every energy investment decision to consider how more energy efficient, cleaner technology can be deployed to move us closer to a low-emissions economy.And, on that, you will all be aware of the Climate Change Commission’s draft advice on the first three emissions budgets.It confirms the reality of the climate change response New Zealand must make. The proposed emissions reductions pathways, aimed at meeting the net-zero carbon target by 2050, are ambitious, they recognise what is technologically and economically realistic, and they consider the impact the pathways will have on people. Encouragingly, the draft report shows we have the tools and technologies available today to make big strides towards a clean and productive industrial sector. New Zealand exporters rely on our clean green brand and there will be new opportunities for our industries as we transition to a zero carbon economy. In the energy sector most of the Commission’s recommendations align well with actions the Government is already taking, or is getting underway, assures us that we are on the right track. The Government will make decisions on emissions budgets by the end of the year once we see the Commission’s final report, due at the end of May. In the meantime I look forward to hearing insights from this sector on how it intends to seize opportunities to transition toward decarbonisation. You will all be familiar with our Energy Strategy slide that illustrates our priorities and work in the sector. It’s a real pleasure to see how far we have progressed on all components of the jigsaw, and you will see more movement as we further pull together these pieces of strands into a cohesive and integrated strategy, fit for the future – I look forward to working with a broad range of stakeholders as we continue this programme of work.Labour’s election pledge to bringing forward our target of 100 per cent renewable electricity by 2030 demonstrates this Government’s bold commitment to decarbonising our electricity system at a faster rate. We have heard the views that achieving 100 renewable electricity is too difficult and expensive, or that we should focus on decarbonising other areas of the energy system first. But these views wrongly assume that we can only achieve progress on one thing at a time, and I believe we must focus on all our levers. Getting to 100 per cent renewable electricity as well as decarbonising the wider energy system by having cleaner transport and industrial heat, requires major change and investment in modern technologiesWe cannot wait and hope our way toward a low emissions future. Removing fossil fuels from our electricity system, while we also increase electricity demand will be challenging, so we are getting on with the task of finding a solution. The New Zealand Battery project has been set up to address the issue of New Zealand’s lack of dry year storage in our electricity system. The $30 million initial study will investigate pumped hydro to eliminate the need for fossil fuels in our electricity system, a recommendation of the Interim Climate Change Committee.The Lake Onslow and other smaller scale pumped hydro options are the focus of the study, with other technologies being assessed as comparators. The first phase of this project is on track to report back in late 2021.We recently announced $70 million for our Government Investment in Decarbonising Industry (GIDI) Fund. This initiative supports businesses through the economic recovery from COVID-19, by helping them adopt energy efficiency measures and switch from fossil fuels like coal and gas to clean energy for process heat.  This part of the energy sector accounts for 9 per cent of our emissions, so GIDI is a great example of how we are investing in a more sustainable economy.MBIE and EECA are currently reviewing the First Round of applicantions and I’m very much looking forward to announcing the first tranche of projects next month. In recent months, I have been encouraged to hear about the pledges and actions by some of our businesses here in New Zealand to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and develop targets and strategies to keep doing more. Making the cuts in industrial energy emissions that the Commission highlights are both feasible and necessary to meet our 2050 target, calls on us to accelerate and expand our work. As the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, we need to look at coal as a priority. That is why this Government has a manifesto commitment to phase out fossil fuels in process heat by preventing the installation of new low and medium-temperature coal-fired boilers. I am currently considering advice from officials on the best mechanism to implement this. But targeting future coal use will not be sufficient to bend the curve on our existing industrial emissions. We have an opportunity now, following last year’s amendments to the Resource Management Act, to provide councils with national direction in addressing industrial greenhouse gas emissions. I am working with the Minister for the Environment to develop a nationally-consistent ruleset for regulating coal boilers and as wjell as encouraging energy efficiency and best available technology across all existing sources of fossil fuels used by industry. The intention is for national direction to be in force by 31 December 2021 to align with the climate change amendments to the RMA coming into effect.  The Government will consult with the public on this in the coming months.We will continue to support our industrial sector through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority‘s business programmes such as the Energy Transition Accelerator to help kiwi businesses plan their transition to low emissions. That is why this Government has committed to doubling EECA’s information, technical assistance and technology demonstration support for business. Despite the years ahead having many uncertainties, I am pleased that the immediate future of the Tiwai Point Smelter is not one of them.  As a result of the deal between Meridian and NZAS we now have a greater understanding and knowledge of the short term national electricity supply and demand picture, until 2024. The extended timeline for the smelter’s operations provides the valuable opportunity to work with stakeholders to put in place the plans we need to support the transition of the Southland economy, including potential new uses of the smelter site, and for Transpower to make the necessary transmission investments to open up new options for the use of Manapouri’s electricity. It also provides the opportunity to work with NZAS to understand the remediation requirements for the Tiwai site, the area being of great cultural and environmental importance, to mana whenua and the wider community.The Government is continuing its discussions with Rio Tinto around NZAS’ transmission costs, but as we have repeatedly said, remediation of the smelter site remains an important area of focus for these discussions.As we discuss the winding down of the Smelter, the liquidation of Tamarind is forcing the Crown to step-in as a provider of last resort to fund decommissioning of the Tui oilfield, has sharpened the focus on the petroleum sector specifically. We expect industry to follow good practice in all areas of their work, and this does include cleaning up after itself. To date, there have been commercial incentives for companies to follow good practice in all areas of their work, including cleaning up. This gives companies the social licence to operate, and it preserves options for future projects. Decommissioning is both a critical and normal part of operations. Critical, because there are significant health and safety, and environmental risks, that can arise if it’s not done.Normal, because it should be an activity that is planned for as part a whole-lifecycle approach to resource development and use, rather than an unexpected cost. Decommissioning the Tui offshore oil field is a first for New Zealand and a new role for the Crown. The costs to taxpayers are significant, in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and the Government will not risk a situation like Tui happening again. In light of this, we are taking steps to strengthen petroleum sector decommissioning provisions. As a first step, I intend to introduce a Crown Minerals Act Amendment Bill that provides an explicit obligation on petroleum permit holders to decommission when they cease production, together with strengthened powers for the regulator to ensure industry compliance. For many, the statutory changes we introduce will clarify existing expectations and spell out best practice: that decommissioning must be carried out, as well as adequately provisioned and planned for. We are developing a regulatory regime to support this, and we will see the regulator step up its monitoring, with powers to periodically assess financial capability, and to require adequate financial security for decommissioning purposes. In addition, where we see behaviour that does not meet the standards we expect across all areas of the CMA, we are giving the regulator access to new compliance and enforcement tools that provide effective and proportionate responses.This work is a priority for our Government and we intend to introduce the Bill this year, and to develop options for the regulations, in parallel. We know that this is an area of significant interest for many, and there will opportunity to provide feedback on both the Bill and the design of the regulations later this year.The Climate Change Commissions’ draft report also contains a recommendation about stopping new natural gas and LPG connections from 2025. I am aware of the media attention that has been received due to this draft recommendation. I wish to reassure New Zealanders that this won’t mean the imminent end of the classic kiwi BBQ.Residential and commercial consumption of gas makes up a small proportion of our overall gas demand – approximately nine per cent in 2019. The phase-out of natural gas from our energy system is a complex issue and the CCC has made clear that it has a use-by-date in New Zealand. The question for the Government is how we can best support this phase-out, while ensuring that consumers can still access the energy they need. This will include considering what the most efficient emissions reductions areas may be within the market. For example, our current gas distribution infrastructure provides many opportunities for alternative lower emissions fuels to be used, including the use of biogas and hydrogen. These are all matters the Government will need to consider before making recommendations about the future of natural gas use in commercial and residential applications over the next thirty or so years.As we transition, our natural gas market will need to continue to provide secure and affordable energy for our electricity system, and keep some of our major manufacturing companies operating. Commercial arrangements in the market are evolving, and we are experiencing a period of transition from traditional arrangements in the market. The current market, commercial, and regulatory settings in the market must be fit-for-purpose for supporting our decarbonisation. This is why I have asked the GIC to investigate the current settings in the natural gas market around contractual arrangements and how these affect the overall availability and flexibility of natural gas. This investigation has no predetermined outcomes and is not about changing upstream settings to unlock more gas reserves; it is about ensuring that the market continues to efficiently allocate gas to its highest value uses. I have asked the GIC to focus on two areas. The first area is how our settings in the gas market support security of electricity – particularly during periods of heightened demand, and whether these are fit for purpose for supporting thermal generation during the transition.The second area is around whether the current settings provide sufficient certainty/transparency about gas supply for their operations.  I expect to receive the GIC’s report by the middle of this year.Meanwhile, we are amending the Gas Act to provide clear regulatory powers for information disclosure issues that may have significant downstream impacts, such as on electricity markets, or create risks for security of supply. The Bill also increases the maximum penalties under the Act to align with the Electricity Industry Act, and is an important step to enhancing confidence in our energy markets, ensuring transparency and helping our markets to operate efficiently. I am also pleased that the Electricity Authority will be placing new obligations on electricity sector participants to disclose information about thermal fuel availability. This will no doubt help inform the market, especially in times of hydro stress.The Electricity Price Review (EPR) investigated whether the electricity sector is delivering fair and equitable prices to consumers.The EPR noted that New Zealand’s electricity industry works well in many respects, but consumers would benefit from stronger competition, fairer and more efficient pricing, and more openness to new technologies. The EPR made six recommendations to increase retail competition and four to reinforce wholesale market competition – these recommendations are currently being progressed by the Electricity Authority. The EPR found that consumers struggle to make their voices heard and have little influence over electricity sector decisions that affect them. The EPR also found that energy hardship is a pressing problem. We are progressing a number of initiatives in response to the EPR findings including:appointing a Consumer Advocacy Council for residential and small business electricity consumersestablishing an Energy Hardship Expert Panel to provide advice to Ministers on policy priorities for addressing energy hardshipWe are also continuing work to phase out Prompt Payment Discounts and Low Fixed Charges which disproportionately impact those in energy hardship Through 2021, we will continue to focus on green hydrogen as a clean and versatile fuel source fulfilling a role similar to that which hydrocarbons play today. Green hydrogen can help reduce global emissions, reduce New Zealand’s dependence on overseas energy sources, create significant export revenue, and create new jobs. New Zealand has a strategically important comparative advantage if we use our abundance of renewable energy to produce hydrogen without using fossil fuels. Looking forward to 2021 in the near future we expect to see:Obayashi and the Tuaropaki Trust commissioning their electrolyser at the Mokai geothermal field which has been delayed by COVID-19.First Gas to publish its study on the suitability of its pipeline network for hydrogen transport, andThe Ports of Auckland to commission its hydrogen refuelling station along with a hydrogen bus for Auckland transport field trials.To fully develop hydrogen’s potential however, we need to ensure a coordinated approach both locally and internationally.  This is why the Government is continuing to develop relationships with other countries interested in hydrogens potential, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Germany.  The importance of having a strategic roadmap for hydrogen’s development in New Zealand has been underscored by our engagements with international partners wanting to invest in green hydrogen projects in New Zealand.Accordingly, the next step in our hydrogen strategy is to develop a hydrogen roadmap that will help chart the path towards a more renewable energy system and outline how hydrogen can play a role in decarbonisation, and energy resilience. The roadmap will focus on accelerating the establishment of an export orientated green hydrogen sector, optimising the utility of green hydrogen for New Zealand’s heavy transport fleet and to better understand other potential uses, such as to support remote communities. A key purpose of the roadmap will also be to assess the future requirement for government support and funding to develop a hydrogen economy for New Zealand and for export purposes.I have always been an advocate of the Government leading by example, and that is why, at the end of last year, the Government launched an initiative to be carbon neutral by 2025. Our Government has thus far committed $10 million to replace coal boilers in eight schools and two hospitals to move towards having a clean powered public service. We also recently committed to a $28 million fund to support the installation of renewable technology, such as solar panels and batteries, on public and Māori housing as part of the COVID Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF) set out in Budget 2020. This project complements both our commitments to increasing both energy affordability and energy efficiency. Technology investments and partnerships can help to develop technologies for abatement for hard-to-reduce emissions. Taranaki-based, Ara Ake has been established to facilitate development of low emissions energy in New Zealand. The Advanced Energy Technology Platform was set up in 2019 to support and develop world-leading research capability in areas of advanced energy science and to deliver on Government’s advanced energy technology investment goals. Funding under this platform has been provided to a range of programmes, including programmes on delivering sustainable industry through smart process heat decarbonisation. I hope we can all continue to successfully collaborate in 2021.  I believe this is fundamental for our transition to a low carbon economy that will benefit all New Zealanders. I look forward to working with you this year and would like to conclude by thanking so many of you for your participation and engagement in 2020. It was a hard year and your contribution were much appreciated.Thank you."
2021-02-09T22:00:05Z,        Hon Stuart Nash,"  Business New Zealand, Corporate and Affiliated Industry Group","Business New Zealand Corporate Affairs and Affiliated Industry GroupHunter Street, Wellington Thank you very much for inviting me today. And thank you for the relationship with Government, the willingness to share your perspectives, and the hugely valuable contribution the business community makes to New Zealand’s economic well-being. I am sure you have heard the word many times. Last year was unprecedented. It required an unprecedented health and economic response and has required significant Government investment here and around the world to support businesses and protect jobs. I would like to acknowledge the work BusinessNZ and its members have done over the past 12 months in helping our businesses and communities through the pandemic. Our collective response to this event is something that I think we should all be very proud of. So thank you. In New Zealand, our careful economic management prior to COVID-19 meant we were in one of the strongest positions in the world to invest to cushion the blow and position the economy for recovery. Already we have seen employment, export and growth numbers that are better than expected. And the Budget Policy Statement that was released yesterday further details the priorities for Budget 2021 and the 2021 Wellbeing Objectives.Latest economic dataAs we saw last week, the latest data from Stats NZ shows the recovering economy is continuing to add jobs, led by a record high for jobs in construction with over 21,000 annually being added. In total employment rose by 17,000 in the December 2020 quarter, up 0.6 percent on the previous September quarter and very pleasingly women made up 10,000 of the increase in the last three months of the year.While the unemployment rate fell from 5.3 percent to 4.9 percent.  This compares with 6.8 percent in Australia and the United States, and 8.7 percent in Canada. The OECD average is 6.9 percent.But the latest statistics do also show that annual wage inflation is slowing as fewer employees receive wage increases, and that over the past year, more than half (55%) of the positions surveyed received no wage increase. New Zealand’s economic recovery is also reflected in the Government’s books which are again in better shape than forecast.The Crown Accounts for the five months to the end of November 2020 were more favourable than forecast in the Half-year Economic and Fiscal Update (HYEFU).The Operating Balance before Gains and Losses (OBEGAL) deficit at $4.3 billion was $1.9 billion better than that forecast in HYEFU, partly due to tax revenue coming in $0.7 billion above forecast, with GST revenue $0.4 billion above forecastAnd we also saw a record 11,291 new homes consented in the December 2020 quarterBut we can’t rest on our laurels. New Zealand’s response to COVID would be insufficient if it were to simply return us to the way we were before the virus.Through this term, this Government is keen to do three things:keep NZ safe from COVID, accelerating the economic recovery to support jobs and businesses.Laying the foundations for the future, such as our climate change and infrastructure workKeeping New Zealanders Safe from COVID-19The first objective of the Government will be to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID.  In keeping New Zealanders safe, we protect jobs, livelihoods, and strengthen our economy.  A strong health response has given the New Zealand economy the best chance at coming back stronger.The Government remains committed to a strategy of elimination, but will always remain open to evolving ways of achieving it.The first layer of defence is our border. Testing, infection control procedures, and professional and quality staffing will remain cornerstones of the response. But as we have shown through the decision to reserve 10 percent of places in our managed isolation for people granted exceptions, we know we must continue to look to create opportunities for businesses to access the skills they need. The Government absolutely supports Kiwi businesses’ enterprise and resilience, and we have been taking measures and implementing initiatives, including changes to various visa settings, to help that. Yet COVID brings complications and processes that didn’t exist before the pandemic. It’s critical that we all follow those processes, give adequate time to ensure the requirements of those processes are met, and all play our part to make sure New Zealand avoids the worst effects of this pandemicI am also aware that MBIE MIQ has, and will continue to, engage with businesses on how best to address concerns as part of the ongoing evolution of the MIQ system.A further area that the Government continues to work with other Governments on is opportunities for freer travel.   As portfolio Minister for Economic Development, Tourism and Small Business I obviously have a very keen interest in progressing these opportunities.My ambition is that once global borders open, New Zealand is considered by the world’s most discerning travellers as one of the top places in the world to visit.Accelerating the RecoveryThe Government’s COVID recovery plan is already underway.  It will now be accelerated as the plans for recovery set out in our election manifesto are implemented.The New Zealand economy has held up better than expected.  Aggressive action to eliminate the virus; strong and early efforts to save jobs and support businesses; and innovative and nimble responses from our businesses have positioned the economy well.  The ongoing impact of COVID on the global economy is the most significant risk to our future growth.  The virus’ spread abroad will have a downstream impact on our exporters and impact economic activity domestically.Governments 5 point economic planThe key plank in how we can accelerate the recovery is through the Government’s five point economic plan. This revolves around the following 5 areas. Investing in our people.Creating jobs and improving productivity Preparing for the futureSupporting small businesses and entrepreneursPositioning New Zealand globallyInvesting in our peopleSupporting people to develop the skills and capabilities needed to realise their potential, succeed in the economy and adapt to change is also essential. As you are all aware the skills and capabilities workers and businesses require in the future are likely to be different to that needed today. The Future of Work Tripartite Forum’s current priorities are: Industry Transformation Plans, support for displaced workers, in-work training, and better protection for contractors. Particularly through my lead role on ITPs we will continue to ensure all ITPs have a focus on skills and ensuring a resilient and skilled workforce for the future. In this frame, each ITP is also seeking to develop skills initiatives that align with and leverage developments in the RoVE programmeAs a member of the Forum Governance Group (with the Ministers of Finance and Education, Kirk Hope of BusinessNZ and Richard Wagstaff of the CTU), I am very much looking forward to continuing to work with Forum, to reflect priorities of the incoming Government. We are also continuing to investigate how to leverage Government procurement to support broader outcomes and drive economic transformation.  Government spends approximately $41 billion per year on Government purchases (13% of GDP), and there are several work streams aimed at implementing improvements to the Procurement system.  In my portfolios I am also keen to see opportunities to support Māori economic prosperity and the long-term wellbeing of Pasifika communities. I am also keen to ensure that our immigration settings are optimising the use of migrant workers to supplement the domestic workforce where there is real need or advantage.Migration policies that allow New Zealand firms to access low-cost foreign labour, while of short-term benefit to the individual business, are likely to inhibit the incentives to improve labour productivity through training and capital investment. Conversely, immigration settings that target highly skilled workers and entrepreneurs can have positive spill-over benefits, including lifting labour productivity, attracting quality investment and helping support economic recovery.Creating jobs and improving productivity and preparing for the future Some of the factors contributing to our poor productivity performance include a small domestic market, geographic isolation, a lack of large firms competing internationally, shallow capital markets, lack of domestic competition, and lack of international connections. These provide genuine challenges, but are not unique to New Zealand. Other small advanced economies have navigated similar challenges to deliver strong productivity growth and I believe New Zealand can do this as well. At the sector level, we are continuing to implement our refreshed industry strategy through strategic partnerships with industries and workers to lift their productivity and support economic transformation. Our refreshed Industry Strategy focusses on two core outcomes.The first is that our path to success must be collaborative and partnership based as we work to drive change in our industries that face major transition challenges, whether it is tourism and export education post-Covid, decarbonisation in our energy sector, or overcoming entrenched productivity and workforce challenges in construction.The second is supporting industries where New Zealand has a competitive advantage, to build clusters of highly productive firms that can take on global markets.In this area we’ve prioritised three broad sectors for industry transformation plans (ITPs): advanced manufacturing, digital technologies, and food and fibre. The food and fibre sector includes work on the primary sector, food and beverage manufacturing, agritech, which we launched last year, and forestry and wood processing.I must acknowledge here the constructive way that BusinessNZ and individual member organisations have engaged with government on our plans for individual sectors right across the economy.This ranges from those in the Construction sector working on what is often referred to as the first ITP Construction Sector Accord and engaged with apprenticeships in this sector, to those in the primary sector engaged on the primary sector roadmap Fit For a Better World.Thank you also to those actively engaged to support our tourism sector in its transition to a sustainable, low carbon, high skill and high wage industryTourism in New Zealand will never return to how it was before COVID-19 dramatically affected us.New Zealanders expect a tourism sector that supports their communities and businesses. We must attract high value and high spending visitors who buy into our own vision of sustainability.We must therefore deliver high quality visitor experiences and exceed our visitors’ expectations. No longer will New Zealand communities tolerate the worst of our freedom camping visitors, and nor should they. We will also continue to investigate ways in which to improve our investment settings through incentives for investment in productive assets, improve access to finance and better investment delivery and management across Government and better access to information. And in the forestry sector I’m focused on two key areas: the first is the encouragement of afforestation at scale that maximises the contribution of our forests to New Zealand’s social, cultural, environmental and economic wellbeing, and minimises possible downsides; andthe second is the encouragement of a strong domestic processing sector to provide carbon neutral materials and energy to decarbonise the economy, generate skilled employment in our regions, and grow the value of our exports. Getting this right will drive large scale afforestation on suitable marginal land with the ability to offset between a quarter and half of New Zealand’s gross emissions in 2050; and the development of a wood bioeconomy that is integral to a productive, sustainable and inclusive future. And my Regional Economic Development priorities will ensure an evolution of our approach to ensure a more coherent and coordinated strategic framework, with a stronger focus on achieving collective impact by targeting and aligning investments.Supporting small business and entrepreneurs Specifically, in the Economic Development and Small business portfolios, we provided an extra $55 million for the Regional Business Partner network, to enable small businesses to utilise this money to obtain free expert advice to help them adapt and innovate to deal with the impact of COVID-19. In 2021 I will be focussed on:Supporting the uptake of digital technology- The Small Business Digital Boost initiative supports small business owners to realise the benefits of digitising their business. This is done through: Digital Boost Spotlight Series showcasing small businesses that recently transformed their businesses by adopting digital tools and ways for working.Digital Boost Skills Training and Support building skills, confidence and trust to enable small businesses to realise the benefits of working digitally.Digital Boost Directory collecting digital tools, technologies, products and services into one depository for small businesses to pick and choose from.Investigating alternative sources of finance for small businessRegulating Merchant Service Fees to support retailersFocus on making life easier for small businesses, including: implementing e-Invoicing; rolling out Business  Connect; establishing a unit to minimise regulatory burdens; legislating for business to business prompt paymentI am also interested in how we might inspire more people to want to start and grow businesses as well as deepening the stock of entrepreneurial capital in New Zealand.Positioning New Zealand globally  In addition to supporting small businesses locally, we announced $216 million to revitalise the international business sector. One of the goals of this package is to significantly increase the number of exporters receiving intensive support from New Zealand Trade and Enterprise (NZTE). This will provide access to tailored NZTE and NZ Inc. resources to connect with overseas markets and global partners. It will underpin business growth for 1400 firms, which currently provide over 200,000 jobs across the export sector. More important is that this funding will boost NZTE’s reach locally with a suite of digital services and tools to help businesses. This will scale up NZTE’s digital and e-Commerce support to provide digital commerce content, tools and advice to more exporters. Having access to expertise to support global moves is fundamental, and that is why we’ve ramped up NZTE’s team of business development managers in international markets. This is even more important while international travel remains restricted. This team will carry out additional functions for companies in-market, such as meeting customers, vetting new employees, and selecting distributors.Another goal is to strengthen New Zealand’s brand in priority markets by maintaining, promoting and broadening our national brand appeal. ‘Brand New Zealand’ is paramount.  We will continue to work on our reputation for safety, trust, resilience, ingenuity, innovation, sustainability and high-value goods and services through the highly successful New Zealand Story strategy and through the development of our sectoral ITPs which all have a strong focus on brand and story for each industry  Laying the foundations for a better futureWellbeing continues to be a priority for Government this term with a focus on reducing child poverty, tackling climate change, and addressing housing.As you will have seen from our response to the first set of Climate Budgets recommended by the Climate Change Commission, we will place a particular focus on sustainability, and pursuing carbon neutrality.As the Commission has laid out, our climate change targets are achievable. But action is needed across all sectors of the economy, with a particular focus on transport, agriculture and energy. There are also opportunities to reducing emissions whilst also creating new jobs, business and export opportunities, whilst also reducing a reduction in household energy bills. I acknowledge BusinessNZ’s positive and considered response to the Commission’s Report and in particular the Sustainable Business Councils response to the report.  As you are aware, the Commission’s draft advice is open for consultation until 14 March and I understand the BusinessNZ Network will be running events with the Commission to give you a chance to hear directly from Chair Rod Carr, and representatives from the Commission's technical teams. Conclusion The shifts across the economy that we are looking for will not take place overnight. However, we are being deliberate about identifying them. Much hard work lies ahead for government, for business, for families and communities. The pandemic will keep raging around the world. But we have a lot that is going right for us, here in New Zealand. It can be said to be the year of the vaccine, and the year of recovery. At the heart of this economic recovery we will prioritise the wellbeing of people. We can both agree on that.(Speech as delivered may differ slightly from text version)"
2021-02-08T19:29:16Z,        Hon Grant Robertson,  Speech to BNZ Breakfast - Budget Policy Statement,"Kia ora. First, can I start by thanking the BNZ for hosting us this morning. This is the third time I have spoken about the Budget Policy Statement at an event organised by the BNZ. The interest shown by the BNZ (and indeed other financial institutions) in our Wellbeing Approach is welcome and an encouraging sign in terms of the way we view success in our economy, and the importance of taking into account a wide range of indicators as we measure our progress.I will come to some of the detail of the Budget Policy Statement shortly, but I want to make some introductory remarks about where we find ourselves in New Zealand today from an economic perspective.  However, first I want to say something about one of the big issues of our time – the cover image of the BPS. Traditionally it was felt sufficient to have some words and the government crest on Budget documents, but in keeping with the move to our Wellbeing Budget we wanted something different.  There has been considerable debate over the past three years as to the images we use, including the use of stock images. I can say with absolute confidence that there is no issue with this year’s image – because I took the photo. It is of Waikawau Bay on the Coromandel Peninsula where I was very fortunate to spend some time over the break. I had never visited before, but like so many New Zealanders I took the opportunity to do something new.   Time and again this summer I have heard New Zealanders express their gratitude that “we have had a summer”. New Zealanders feel fortunate. With a global pandemic raging around the world there is the strong sense that we’d rather be here in New Zealand than anywhere else in the world right now. We have to remember that this did not happen by accident. We are fortunate, but not lucky in my view. We had a plan, we stuck to it, and the hard work and sacrifice of New Zealanders made it happen. Of course, we can’t risk complacency when it comes to our privileged position regarding COVID. But this does help keep at the forefront of our minds just what is at stake as we enter 2021. There’s a lot to protect:A health response that has meant the fewest deaths per capita in the Western world, according to analysis by Johns Hopkins University. But remembering that 25 New Zealanders have died from this insidious virus.An economic recovery that has been one of the strongest in the world as countries continue to battle new waves of COVID-19.An unemployment rate that is falling, and has – so far – refused to go over five-and-a-half percent, despite the world facing its greatest economic shock in 100 years.The ability for New Zealanders to attend concerts, sporting events, eat and drink in cafes and bars – and all while being able to travel around our magnificent country and experience our own backyard.And being able to visit our relatives and friends here in New Zealand, particularly those who are vulnerable in care homes or hospitals – something that many families around the world are unable to do.None of this takes away what we have all collectively experienced over the past year. 2020 was tough – no doubt about it – and many New Zealanders have had their lives turned upside down. But 2020 was also a year where New Zealand, and New Zealanders, showed our true spirit. It’s that spirit which will underpin our recovery. As we take stock of the position our economy and people are in and we enter this next stage of dealing with COVID-19, it’s against this backdrop that today I’m announcing the priorities for Budget 2021.Background and ContextA year ago this month I delivered a speech – ironically at the Pullman Hotel in Auckland – titled “New Zealand economy in strong position to respond to Coronavirus.”The night before, the World Health Organisation had reported that – for the first time – there had more cases of coronavirus reported outside China than inside on the previous day.It was unclear in February last year – all over the world – just how the coronavirus situation would play out. We took a decision to plan for all eventualities. Advice we were receiving from Health and Treasury officials about the potential impact on the economy was based around three scenarios:a temporary global demand shock a longer lasting shock to the domestic economy, as the global impact fed through to the economy for a period of time, and where there were coronavirus cases in New Zealand, and,a global downturn if the worst case played out around the world, and we had a global pandemic.It’s fair to say that the third scenario was certainly not the central expectation. Not here in New Zealand, nor elsewhere around the world. But we made sure we were planning for all three scenarios. I even said in the speech that: “In such circumstances [of a global pandemic], it may be necessary to consider immediate fiscal stimulus to support the economy as a whole and businesses and individuals through this period.”This was 350 days ago. At the time, the Treasury had begun to re-run its economic forecasts ahead of the upcoming Budget in May, mapping out under the different scenarios what impact COVID might have on the economy, businesses and jobs.As you all know, by April, as the COVID pandemic worsened around the world and concerns grew about exports and the impact of COVID on the domestic economy, scenarios from the Treasury showed that unemployment could rise into the teens or 20-percents, representing more than 350,000 people out of work. By then, we were already working to a simple plan for the economy – to deliver cashflow and confidence. We had already put in place the Wage Subsidy scheme which eventually grew to support nearly 1.8 million jobs, allowing New Zealanders to stay in work. We had an air freight subsidy scheme underway to ensure our exporters could keep going, and we had kept our national airline in business. At the Budget in May, as we extended the Wage Subsidy and created the $50 billion COVID Response and Recovery Fund, the Treasury’s central scenario was for unemployment to have hit 10% by now – about 270,000 people out of work.Here, today, as we enter 2021, New Zealand’s unemployment rate has just ticked down from 5.3% to 4.9% at the end of 2020. The number of unemployed people fell by 10,000 to 141,000. Even more jobs were created, as people answered the calls for more workers and entered the labour force – with employment up by 17,000 over the quarter.The average unemployment rate across the OECD is currently 6.9%. Many of our trading partners have experienced unemployment rates above 10% already.That’s not to say there is not more work to do. There is. A number of sectors and regions are particularly affected, and are likely to see further job losses over the coming months. Now it is more important than ever that we double down on our investments to get people into work and train our local workforce to fill skills gaps and get ready for the economic opportunities from moving towards a carbon-neutral and more sustainable economy.Other data adds to the solid foundations for the recovery in New Zealand to date:Average hourly wages are up by more than 4% compared to a year ago.Retail sales bounced back in the second half of 2020 as consumer confidence rose as the economy opened up quickly.Global dairy prices have started the year strongly and are up 13% on a year ago – Fonterra has lifted its 2020/21 milk price forecast to a range of $6.90 to $7.50 (up from $6.70 to $7.30).And GDP in the September quarter was stronger than expected – economic activity is higher than it was pre-COVID. BNZ’s economists have pointed out that only three other advanced economies can lay claim to this as the world continues to grapple with the impact of COVID-19 (China, Taiwan and Ireland).Even the business confidence opinion surveys are improving.With COVID-19, we know not to take anything for granted. The world is still very much grappling with the pandemic and this year has many challenges to come. But our economy has rebounded far better than expected and we are in a strong position to handle what comes at us. Wellbeing OutlookAs with the previous Budget Policy Statements I have released, we have included a Wellbeing Outlook in the Budget Policy Statement. This year it focuses on how COVID-19 has affected New Zealanders’ wellbeing.New Zealanders have generally maintained their personal wellbeing through COVID. Stats NZ’s decision to include wellbeing questions in their quarterly employment surveys through 2020 means they’ve tracked people’s individual wellbeing through lockdown and the recovery, across areas like health, anxiety, loneliness, financial wellbeing, and life satisfaction. Reported levels of life satisfaction remained high through 2020. In fact, average life satisfaction was higher in the June and September quarters (covering lockdown and the recovery), than it was in 2018.So as we stand here today, we are privileged in New Zealand to be entering 2021 in a relatively strong position as this global pandemic continues to wreak havoc around the world.This position is not the result of luck. It is the result of having a clear plan for dealing with COVID and the economic recovery. We were confident that the best economic response was a strong public health response. This is, to me, the essence of a wellbeing approach. Not just looking at the financial bottom line but taking a longer-term view that prioritised our wellbeing as people and communities. Economic and Fiscal PositionThe economic and social data backs our decision – as a country – to take a wellbeing approach to our response to COVID-19.Our strong fiscal position heading into COVID-19 has supported that approach. It allowed us to move quickly and with scale to protect lives and livelihoods, and invest in the recovery by backing business.We were able to make the investments required to protect New Zealanders’ lives and livelihoods because of our careful economic management and low debt heading into COVID-19. The investments to protect jobs through the Wage Subsidy, invest in infrastructure and make sure essential services like our health system had appropriate funding to respond to the pandemic did require immediate use of more debt.The acceptance across the Parliamentary divide during the election campaign that these levels of debt were required for the ongoing response to COVID was an acknowledgement that our response has been the right thing to do.My focus continues to be on getting the balance right – investing in strong public services while keeping a lid on that debt. We are in a strong position in New Zealand – with our debt remaining lower than countries like Australia, the UK and the US on comparable measures.Our balanced and careful approach is flowing through to improved projections for the Government’s books.The latest Crown accounts show the deficit in the first five months of this financial year was $1.9 billion smaller – or 30% better – than expected by the Treasury as recently as December.New projections out from the Treasury today show continued improvement in our fiscal position over time.Projections at the time of the Pre-election update in September showed net debt falling from a peak of about 56% of GDP in 2024 to 48% of GDP in 2034. New projections using Treasury’s Fiscal Strategy model today show net debt now at 36.5% of GDP in 2034/35. That represents about $60 billion less debt at the end of the projection period than at the pre-election update.Importantly, incorporated into the new projections are increases in the capital allowances over this time as well – totalling an extra $7 billion by 2033/34. This is the money earmarked for infrastructure investment (and not including NZTA projects which are funded separately through FED and RUC).Budget 2021 will include a strong focus on making sure spending continues to be carefully prioritised and targeted at the areas and people that require it the most. The Budget spending allowances for Budget 2021 in today’s BPS are the same as announced at the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update. We have reserved the right to change them depending on the state of forecasts for the global and New Zealand economies when we finalise the Budget.  The significant resources we have put into the recovery and rebuild will be supplemented by further investment over coming Budgets, but quite clearly we need to strike a balance with rebuilding and maintaining a strong fiscal position. This includes rigorously assessing all of the spending that was provided for in the COVID Response and Recovery Fund. As the economy has rebounded stronger-than-expected, we are taking the opportunity to assess if money can be better targeted or reprioritised where it has not already been used. Budget 2021 prioritiesThe Budget Policy Statement released today sets out how we will carefully prioritise and target spending to where it is needed most in Budget 2021.The Government’s overarching objectives for this term were set out in the Speech from the Throne:Continuing to keep New Zealand safe from COVID-19Accelerating the recovery and rebuild from the impacts of COVID-19, andLaying the foundations for the future, including addressing key issues such as our climate change response, housing affordability and child poverty.Budget 2021 will play a critical role in all three of these objectives. The Budget gives us a chance to take stock of how New Zealand and New Zealanders have come through COVID-19, and act on the opportunities available to us through our strong financial position, as we build back better.Specific Budget 2021 investments will fall under four high-level priorities:continuing the COVID-19 responsedelivering priority and time-sensitive manifesto commitmentssupporting core public services through managing critical cost pressures, andcontinuing to deliver on existing investments.The important aspect of the process is how we prioritise which investments to make under those priorities. As part of the changes we have made to the Public Finance Act, the Budget Policy Statement must now set out the Wellbeing Objectives that will guide the decisions we make about what to fund through the Budget.The Wellbeing Objectives continue the evidence-based approach we’ve taken under the Wellbeing Budget process. This year’s objectives take into account recent wellbeing and economic data to update the Budget 2020 and 2019 priorities:The Wellbeing Objectives for Budget 2021 are:Just Transition – Supporting the transition to a climate-resilient, sustainable and low-emissions economy while building back from COVID-19Future of Work – Enabling all New Zealanders and New Zealand businesses to benefit from new technologies and lift productivity and wages through innovation, and support into employment those most affected by COVID-19, including women and young people Māori and Pacific – Lifting Māori and Pacific incomes, skills and opportunities, and combatting the impacts of COVID-19Child Wellbeing – Reducing child poverty and improving child wellbeing, andPhysical and Mental Wellbeing – Supporting improved health outcomes for all New Zealanders and keeping COVID-19 out of our communities.HousingSeveral challenges cut across the Wellbeing Objectives - such as climate change, housing and child wellbeing. In the time I have remaining, I’m going to focus on one of those areas – housing.Across the Wellbeing Objectives, Budget 2021 will have a clear focus on housing.Housing outcomes can be influenced across a range of the Budget 2021 Wellbeing Objectives: The sustainability of our housing stock will contribute to our Just Transition and climate change goals; Māori and Pacific communities currently have lower rates of home ownership and will benefit from more affordable housing; And, improving children’s wellbeing will be greatly influenced by improving access to warm, safe, dry and affordable housing, as will physical and mental wellbeing.There is a crisis when it comes to the housing situation right now in New Zealand. In a sign of how economic forecasts have swung wildly during COVID, mid-way through last year, economists were lock-step in predicting that house prices were going to fall 5%-10% over the next year due to the COVID-19 downturn.We’ve seen the how the effects of rising demand for property by speculators and investors has blown those mid-year projections for prices to fall, out of the water. In actual fact, between June 2020 and December, the nationwide median house price rose by 17%, and sat 19% higher than at December 2019. REINZ’s house price index was up 17% from a year ago – 9% in the final three months of the year. Rents, in comparison, have remained relatively stable. Stats NZ’s two monthly measures for rental property prices – incorporating bonds lodged for rentals – were up 1.5% and 3.1% annually in December.As we foreshadowed in January, the Government will announce a rolling series of measures to build on what we did last term to address the crisis in housing. The first of those will be on the demand side measures which will come in late February. We all know that building more houses, particularly affordable houses, is critical. But we also can do more to manage demand, particularly from those who are speculating. New Zealanders are seeing family members being crowded out of the opportunity to purchase a home of their own by speculators and investors. We want to tilt the balance more towards first home buyers, while also incentivising more investment in the construction of homes. As I said late last year, we have received advice from both Treasury and the Reserve Bank on our existing measures to manage demand and discourage speculation, and how they can be enhanced or changed. Proposals will shortly go before Cabinet.As the Prime Minister has outlined, we will also make more announcements on the supply side as Budget 2021 is finalised. These will build on the Government’s housing programme that has seen us build more houses than any Government since the 1970s. Anyone who tries to tell you that there is a single silver bullet for addressing the housing crisis is not facing reality (or is speaking from the safety of Opposition). What we do know is that now is the time for bold action. The market has moved quickly and rapidly in a way that is not sustainable. We have to confront some tough decisions, and we will do that. Conclusion2021 will be an important year for New Zealand. It’s been called the Year of the Vaccine, Year of the Recovery. Both of these are essential to giving us the ability to not only open our country up again, but also address the long-term challenges that pre-date COVID 19. We will continue to face significant risks. This pandemic will continue to rage around the world. It will continue to affect global trade and New Zealand’s exports. It will continue to mutate.For us in New Zealand, it does mean that unemployment is likely to continue to bump around. Industries like tourism and international education will continue to be affected by border settings. But 2021 is also Year of the Ox in the Chinese calendar – denoting hard work, positivity and honesty.When I was writing that speech a year ago – against the backdrop of uncertainty around the world about how the coronavirus would impact the global economy, I attempted to convey some critical points about my confidence in the resilience of our people and our economy.The first was that “we have the capacity and ability to do what it takes” as a country to deal with whatever COVID-19 would throw at us. We proved that. The next was to remind people “that these scenarios are all temporary. The effects of this virus will pass.” We are not quite there yet, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. And I stole the last one from a good friend of mine. That: “we are all in this together.”In New Zealand, we have stuck together. And now we’re in position to take that mantra and tackle the next big challenges ahead of us."
2021-02-04T08:13:20Z,        Hon Nanaia Mahuta,  Inaugural Foreign Policy Speech to Diplomatic Corps,"I’m pleased to welcome you today to Waitangi, the recognised birthplace of Aotearoa New Zealand, where in just a few days we will be acknowledging 180 years of treaty partnership between the indigenous Maori inhabitants and the British settlers who arrived here.The strengths and achievement of New Zealand have been born out of the richness of diversity represented in that partnership, by all of us working together to create the country we are today. The principles of partnership and mutual respect embodied in the Treaty provide the foundation for how New Zealand conducts its foreign policy today.The past year has been unprecedented for us all impacting in very different ways including the Diplomatic Corps as we try to comprehend the challenges presented by the global pandemic.Our respective nations have been caught in the same storm and we have looked to each other and drawn from our experiences to help navigate our way through.We are not there yet.But we do know that only by working together will we hope to beat COVID-19.This year our continued vigilance is required as we continue to work through our response.We continue to learn that collaboration, agility, care, communication and acting for the common good is absolutely necessary.Te Tiriti and foreign policyI am reminded that the expectation imbued in our founding document sets out the framework between the Crown and Māori for mana (respect and authority) to be recognised and kawanatanga (governance) to be exercised in a manner that would affirm tino rangatiratanga (sovereign authority) so that all people can prosper. The principles of partnership and mutual respect embodied in the Treaty provide the foundation for how New Zealand can conduct its foreign policy.Our Treaty experience has taught lessons about managing and creating enduring relationships. Embracing differing world views can assist to address the complex issues of social exclusion, civil and racial unrest, inequity and poverty.The pathway to finding solutions in the international domain can be rocky, just as reconciliation here has had its challenges, twists and turns. We understand that a societal culture based on shared understanding, the blending of different perspectives, diversity of thought and actions taken towards nation-building are important building blocks for peace and prosperity.The same is true, I believe, for diplomacy.Outcomes will be stronger and more enduring if they are built through dialogue, shared understanding, and taking account of a range of diverse perspectives.Aotearoa New Zealand’s identity is drawn from our Polynesian heritage. I call it “tirohanga Maori”, or a Māori world view, with its vibrant culture and deep affinity with the natural world.Then there are the Western institutions on which our country is founded that aligns New Zealand internationally.As New Zealand has grown to understand its unique and independent identity, so too has our sense of responsibility. We can offer a mature approach to dialogue aimed at progressing regional and global priorities, which is, born from a cultural perspective. It is my intention to take a values-based approach to foreign policy and work collectively in pursuit of our core interests, which include:an international rules based order, which gives all countries a voice and provides frameworks that promote stability; keeping New Zealanders safe, promoting regional stability;international conditions and connections that aid our prosperity, including supply chain resilience; and,global action on sustainability issues such as climate change where solutions depend on international cooperation.Upholding special responsibilities in the Realm and Antarctica are also core elements of our foreign policy.We are in Te Pēwhairangi – the Bay of Islands – the place where the signing of New Zealand’s first international treaty occurred.It confirms our enduring commitment to the importance of international rules and institutions. Kororareka – Russell reminds us that it was a staging post for some of New Zealand’s earliest international trade relations were formed. We each have our own story but the institutions, rules, trade conditions and relationships form the foundation of our foreign policy.A Values Based Approach – Aotearoa-New ZealandAs the first indigenous woman to lead this portfolio, I believe we have a prime opportunity to call on the bi-cultural values that have characterised who we are. Values such as:manaaki – kindness or the reciprocity of goodwill;whanaunga – our connectedness or shared sense of humanity;mahi tahi and kotahitanga – collective benefits and shared aspiration; and,kaitiaki – protectors and stewards of our intergenerational wellbeing.Each of these values when expressed in a relationship gives a sense that everything is connected and purposeful. What the world needs now is a commitment towards empathy, sustainability, and intergenerational solutions for wellbeing.New Zealand will be a predictable and reliable partner. When I refer to being predictable I also mean that you will see New Zealand applying the values that reflect who we are as a nation. These include the way we consider international development assistance as a means to be a responsible neighbour, offer help when needed and act as a strategic partner to co-invest and build long term resilience in partner countries.It also means that as we champion human rights, we also seek to extend our advocacy towards sustainable and inclusive outcomes in trade, inclusive and transparent democracy, ethical investment and social inclusion.When I reflect on climate change – what our Prime Minister has referred to as the ‘nuclear issue of our generation’ – it means we make solid progress so the next generation feel the benefit of the actions we take to leave the planet a better place than what we inherited, to inspire hope that it is possible to make a difference.Our experience means that we can advocate with certainty for the recognition and inclusion of indigenous knowledge and economic participation. This will help to address issues of social exclusion, poverty and inequity.Importantly, indigenous perspectives are linked to the broader objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals, which provide a strong platform to initiate action that will create long-lasting impact.So you see, our lived experience, our values, our deep conviction of what we stand for as a nation means that we will stand for what we believe is in our interest, unafraid to hold our course when the tide turns to navigate towards our destination.The PacificAotearoa has historical, cultural, social, linguistic and kin connections across the Pacific all of which links us to the significant diaspora communities here. We refer to the Blue Pacific Continent as Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa. Our Pacific reset policy is an important commitment. I’m clear that our relationships across the Pacific acknowledges the inherent mana of each country. I want this to be reflected in the way we partner and engage in the long term resilience of Pacific nations. By building on the values of whanaungatanga (kinship), kotahitanga (common purpose) and kaitiakitanga (stewardship and care) we can promote investment, advocacy, and co-partnering the long term resilience of the Pacific.The significant economic impacts of COVID-19 in the Pacific amplifies the climate change threat and the prospect of significant social and economic dislocation. Ensuring a robust delivery pipeline for a vaccination roll-out will be the first challenge we confront in this new era of whanaungatanga and manaaki.For those who seek to partner in the Pacific we need a renewed commitment and effort to recharge our approach to support the security and prosperity of the region.I will promote an approach that will work to build on Pacific peoples’ own capabilities. Co-partnering and co-investing for resilience – deploying new ways of working, including improving technology, fostering science, research, innovation and private sector collaboration, and strengthening governance.This approach means that here in New Zealand we engage more deliberately with Pacific communities to ensure that they are connected and contribute to resilience projects. The survival of home languages, education and skills development, delivering in-country infrastructure, and workforce development are opportunities for an integrated effort.International institutions and rulesNew Zealand relies upon international organisations and global rules to voice our views on important issues. Since Peter Fraser and the founding of the United Nations, we have worked alongside those who share our enduring democratic values and our fundamental interest in a rules-based order that reflects those values – to build a more liberal and inclusive world.   The challenge of climate change makes our constructive engagement with those who share our aspirations more important than ever.We have been an active member and remain committed to its laws and institutions; the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the World Health Organisation (WHO), and the bodies upholding the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), international climate change agreements and international human rights treaties, among others. At a regional level, we support the efforts of the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) and Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). New Zealand will lean into these organisations and work hard to foster collaboration. Leaning into the international rules-based order means pulling our weight – doing our bit. With our values as a compass, we will work through international organisations towards goals that we have long championed. These include: a commitment to human rights, democracy, the international rule of law, and nuclear disarmament; removing barriers to trade and investment to raise incomes, create employment, and promote innovation, increase productivity; tackle inequality and injustice through our development programme and our advocacy. I believe there is cause for optimism internationally. We have seen what can be achieved when we work together to find global solutions to global problems.Several vaccines developed to combat COVID-19 has occurred with haste and without precedent. Countries have come together to create the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Facility to ensure guaranteed and equitable access.  Global initiatives are accelerated when all of the great powers participate and cooperate. New Zealand welcomes the recent announcements from President Biden that the United States will take a science-based approach to combating the challenge of COVID-19, re-committing to the WHO.  Also, the signals being sent by re-joining the Paris Agreement and renewing its commitment to enhancing the role of the WTO will help to reset our shared ambition in supporting international institutions and upholding a rules based system. International tradeNew Zealand is and has always been a trading nation.  Today our commitment to free trade and open markets is reflected in our chairing this year of APEC. Through APEC we will lead work to build regional resilience through the sustainable expansion of trade; and supporting our exporters to make the transition to a low-carbon economy.We will work with APEC economies to facilitate trade in a list of environmental goods and services and explore the new opportunities offered by digital trade. We are also keen to develop an indigenous trade cooperation instrument with willing APEC partners.A rules-based trade system is central as we work through our COVID-19 response. Trade delivers more jobs, better wages, and drives innovation and productivity. Our outward looking focus means that we continue to seek out opportunity in this challenging environment.In November, New Zealand signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) Agreement. Encompassing 15 economies and home to almost a third of the world’s population, this agreement will take over half of New Zealand’s exports. RCEP is estimated to add $186 billion to the world economy, and increase New Zealand’s GDP by around $2 billion once fully implemented.Just last week, New Zealand and China signed an upgrade to our bilateral free trade agreement. Our bilateral FTA has been a platform for closer trade and economic cooperation, with two-way trade now at $32 billion.We are continuing negotiations on new trade architecture – including FTAs with the European Union and the United Kingdom – New Zealand’s third and sixth largest export markets respectively.These agreements will build relationships and bring opportunities for our exporters to rebound more strongly from the challenges they have faced over the past year, as well as helping to reinforce the international supply chains that have proved so essential in responding to COVID-19.New Zealand last year signed the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA) with Chile and Singapore; and is currently negotiating an Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability, (ACCTS). The latter is a practical example of using trade rules to drive positive outcomes for the environment through the reform of fossil fuel subsidies and to lower the cost of environmental goods and services.  Both of these agreements are open to all WTO members to join. RelationshipsUnderpinning all of our efforts are Relationships, Relationships, Relationships – he tangata te mea nui. These are the building blocks for our international connections.The trans-Tasman relationship is critical for New Zealand’s prosperity and security.  Australia is our only formal ally and an indispensable partner across the breadth of our international interests.  The Pacific shapes New Zealand’s identity and influences our security, prosperity and strategic environment. Mature and robust relationships with Pacific countries are essential to progressing our interests. Promoting agreed Pacific priorities is vital (COVAX) to New Zealand. New Zealand has a deep stake in the wider Indo-Pacific region’s stability. We share the common ambition of Peace and Prosperity for the region, including through greater economic integration, and adherence to its institutions and norms. The ten ASEAN countries, Japan, Korea, and India are all important relationships for New Zealand. We have much in common and will continue to invest effort with them.   Our relationship with the United States is an integral defence and security partner and our third largest individual trading relationship. New Zealand’s relationship with the United States will continue to strengthen.  China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner and an important relationship.  We seek a mature relationship where both parties have realistic expectations of each other, as we look for opportunities to work together where we are able to. Canada is a strong friend, we share common values and objectives for the sort of world we want to operate within. I am encouraged by the positive signals in our relationship to progress indigenous collaboration and intend to see the strength of this commitment grow.Our relationships in Europe are longstanding based shared interests in upholding the rule of law, promoting human rights and democracy and working together to address some of the most serious issues facing the world, including on the environment and climate change. Our relationship with the United Kingdom is historic and enduring.By concluding our ambitious, comprehensive free trade agreements with both the United Kingdom and the European Union our commitment to both these relationships will be strengthened. Reflecting New Zealand’s significant commitment to engaging across a diverse range of relationships, we will also continue to invest in our relationships across Latin American and the Caribbean.Our effort to progress partnerships in the Middle East is a signal of how we value growing opportunities in the region.  I’m also personally keen to put more effort into our relationships across Africa, where I believe there is great scope for mutually beneficial partnerships centred on political, trade and economic interests. As I expressed earlier, I want to deepen the opportunity that our country-to-country relationships can help forge with indigenous peoples. Committing to a National Plan of Action for the Implementation of UNDRIP is a part of that approach.It has previously been difficult to bring indigenous relationships to the fore. I believe the time has come to ensure a more inclusive approach to indigenous issues being a feature of foreign policy. This will see economic, social, environmental and cultural benefits to countries willing to step up to this opportunity. We must be deliberate on this front otherwise civil unrest, poverty and social deprivation are likely to emerge – it does not have to be this way.We will nurture our relationships with like-minded partners who share our values. We will work with small and medium sized countries to bring a collective voice into international forums and form strategic positions on issues that define the type of global community we want to see.As Foreign Minister, I’m looking for mature relationships, acting on the values that define who New Zealanders are and creating space to, at times, agree to disagree on fundamental principles.As an Indigenous Foreign Minister however, I believe that diplomacy is intergenerational in its intent, where we put people, planet, peace and prosperity for all at the centre. This approach sits at the core of my ambition to lead a different approach. In closing, as our tūpuna (ancestors), navigated their passage here through South East Asia and across the Pacific.Those ancestors used the stars, maramataka (Māori calendar) currents and wind as navigational tools to traverse the oceans.They relied on an ancient body of knowledge, innovation and skill to remain agile and attuned to the natural world.Sometime later they met our European ancestors who had found their way to these remote isles with similar levels of courage, bravery, and navigational aids. Our Western forebears introduced new knowledge, technology, language, beliefs and institutions to settle and survive in our country.Today in an increasingly interdependent world much has changed. We are experiencing a global pandemic. Closed borders has changed the way we undertake diplomacy, digital platforms have taken the place of ‘kanohi ki te kanohi’ or face to face diplomacy. That is why it is important to reinforce at every level in actions and words, the values that define who we are.Our values act as fixed markers to guide our way towards the peaceful and prosperous future we seek.These worldviews and aspirations vested in the Treaty of Waitangi attempted to bring together a shared aspiration for our country bringing together knowledge, respect, understanding and innovation to shape the nation we want to be. We have had many challenges but we keep moving forward.There is no better metaphor for where we are as a nation than the modern aerodynamic Team New Zealand waka, Te Rehutai. Bringing together the proud maritime legacy of two cultures – this indicates that together we have the capacity to move forward with confidence.No reira kua pari ngā tai, kua timu ngā tai, he tai ope, he tai roa e kūmea mai nei i te tai nui kia eke panuku, eke tangaroa, Haumi e! Hui e! Taiki e!"
2021-02-02T22:18:05Z,        Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern,  Unveiling of grave marker at Ruapekapeka,"Ki ngā toa ka takoto ki te Pōtakoto, takototēnā tātou katoa.Ki te Mana Whenuatēnā koutou.Ki te manuhiri tūāranginau mai, haere mai.Huri noa, huri noa. Tēnā tātou katoa.The Right Honourable Dame Patsy Reddy, Governor General of New Zealand; Her Excellency Laura Clarke, British High Commissioner to New Zealand; Pita Tipene, interim chair of Te Ruapekapeka Trust and its trustees, my fellow Ministers and Members of Parliament; esteemed guests and decedents here today: welcome. I want to begin by echoing our Governor General’s acknowledgement of Mr Allan Halliday whose absence is so keenly felt today. Allan was a man of great generosity and selflessness. He put so much of himself into these commemorations. I hope he would be proud of today. And so too I begin by acknowledging all the hard work that has gone into Ruapekapeka 175 by the Trust and by Ngāti Manu, Te Ka potai, Ngāti Hau and Ngāti Hine.Over the past month you have held events that have honoured all those who fought on both sides at Te Ruapekapeka, including the women and children who fought on the front line and supported the fighting throughout.But today, we continue to honour those who fought so valiantly at this pā.Some of the stories of Ruapekapeka have become legendary: of children inside the pā defusing enemy shells before they could detonate; of the abandonment of the pā as a trap for attacking forces; and of this remarkable and masterful structure, that was finally set ablaze, the smoke and glow seen for miles around.But in remembering the legends out of the Battle of Ruapekapeka, we will not lose sight of the real cost: of those who died, here, fighting in this field.We remember the approximately twenty Māori and twelve British fatal casualties of the battle.And we must do our best to remember them, not as numbers, but as people who died in a bloody struggle.They are who we commemorate today. And they are who lie before us: who lay unmarked for so many years.As part of the wider events we are here specifically to mark the place where twelve British soldiers, sailors, and marines were laid to rest at the conclusion of the Battle of Ruapekapeka, 175 years ago.But the broader significance of this commemoration, and the greater loss of Ruapekapeka, is recognised in the text engraved in the stone: He Rua Whakautu mō te Riri – In Remembrance of the Conflict.I wish to acknowledge the whanaunga of Ruapekapeka, who have embraced the memory of these twelve, even as your ancestors bore such terrible loss here, and throughout Aotearoa’s internal conflicts.That act in itself speaks truly of reference, of remembrance, of peace.I wish also to thank Jonathan Carpenter and his team of archaeologists, whose years of work culminated in this extraordinary discovery. You have added another page to our nation’s history. There can be a tendency in New Zealand to underplay our history: to say that ours did not happen on the scale of other countries around the world, and that somehow scale has some bearing on significance. That view is wrong. James Belich famously wrote of the New Zealand Wars: ‘These were not storms in a teacup or gentlemanly bouts of fisticuffs. These were bitter and bloody struggles, as important to New Zealand as were the Civil Wars to England and the United States.’As a country, we’ve long commemorated battles abroad as being foundational to who we are as a nation – but what could be more foundational to who we are than what happened here, on this whenua. Let us teach it, let us learn it and let us remember it. Let us share our history with every student in every school and kura so that students are aware of how our country and identity have been shaped by key moments in our past – moments such as this, the Battle of Ruapekapeka.For when we fully understand the many paths of our ancestors, we build an Aotearoa New Zealand that better understands itself. Let that be a lasting legacy of 175 years of Ruapekapeka. Titiro atu ki te taumata o te moana…tākiri ko te ata(Look beyond the configurations on the horizon)Nō reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa."
2021-01-29T02:46:54Z,        Hon Aupito William Sio,  Closing Ceremony of the Tupu Tai Pasifika Public Sector Summer Internship Programme,"The value of a Pacific cultural heritage lens in public policyAcknowledgementsKia orana tatou katoatoa; Malo e lelei, Fakalofa lahi atu, Talofa, Malo ni, Talofa ni, Mauri, Ni sa bula vinaka, Noia, Warm Pacific greetings to you all, tena koutou, tena koutou, tena koutou katoa.Can I begin by acknowledging you and each of you this morning, and in particular, your families, and friends of the 2020/21 Tupu Tai cohort. Fa’afetai to all the government departments and their representatives here today, for supporting our Pacific young people on what is ultimately a journey towards a more diverse and skilled workforce.Fa’afetai also to the interns for stepping up and putting yourself forward, and for the journey that you’ve been on over the past 11 weeks; exploring and getting insight into the machinery of the public service, building your confidence in yourself and the workplace, and learning how to navigate settings and situations, and ultimately, sharing your diversity and cultural capital, your uniqueness to help make Aotearoa New Zealand a better place for our communities to live, work, thrive and prosper. Importance of Tupu TaiThe opportunity you’ve been given matters. Not only for your own journey but for the journey that lies ahead for Aotearoa New Zealand – the growing Pacific population means that the success of our country, will soon be reliant on the success of our Pacific peoples. Tupu Tai has, and continues, to be a platform and space that helps to facilitate the pipeline of getting more Pacific peoples into the public service, and it underpins a shared commitment to improving Pacific economic outcomes. Increasing Pacific peoples in policy rolesThis is achieved not only through ensuring our Government is supporting Pacific peoples into higher studies, but it is achieved through the support of Government and Public Sector agencies being committed to building a more diverse public service that includes more and greater opportunities for Pacific peoples. Currently Pacific peoples make up only 3 per cent of the policy roles in government and the public service. To increase this, requires collaboration and commitment from everyone at every level of the public sector and government, as well as an understanding of what we bring to the table, and how critical this is to ensuring policy serves the diverse needs, abilities, hopes, dreams and aspirations of our Pacific community. I hope that in the last 11 weeks, you’ve been able to get a greater sense of confidence about your worth as a Pacific person, and the value of your cultural heritage, to public policy.I and Hon Nanaia Mahuta, Minister of Foreign Affairs, use our cultural knowledge, our stories, principles and values to guide the work we do as Government Ministers. The Maori principles of aroha, kaitiakitanga, manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, are principles that are included in our legislation and we use them today to guide our wellbeing approach. They equate to alofa/compassion, the recognition of the intrinsic mana that we are born with, our inalienable rights as free peoples, and our strength as a collective of aiga/whanau/kainga, as opposed to individuals. These cultural values provide us with a powerful world view that is uniquely ours in Aotearoa.Minister Mahuta and I, including the Prime Minister and our Government colleagues are using the unique cultural values of Aotearoa to guide and direct public policy whilst we are in Government.I invite you to also do the same. Use your cultural heritage as a lens for policy development.The role of MPP in supporting Pacific prosperityCertainly for me, across my ministerial portfolios, but namely as Minister for Pacific Peoples, I’m aware of the challenges that confront us, but also the opportunities that lie ahead. Our story as Pacific peoples in Aotearoa New Zealand continues to evolve; over 60 per cent of our Pacific population are New Zealand born. We are now settled and growing throughout regional New Zealand. There are many Pacific with bicultural parentage who whakapapa to Maori. Those who have heard me speak before will be familiar with a phrase I proudly champion when referencing our Pacific population in Aotearoa. I refer affectionately to the generation that is before us as Generation 6 Bs – they’re Brown, Beautiful, Brainy, Bilingual, Bicultural and Bold.I only need to look around the room at our interns to know that this generation have an invested interest and an unwavering passion for ensuring our Pacific peoples are successful and thriving. We have to lead and drive the narrative in Aotearoa on who we are, our strengths, our resilience and resolve, and our aspirations for ourselves, our families, our communities and Aotearoa. To help ensure this, my Ministry will continue to engage with Pacific peoples to strengthen the already formidable picture that we have on where Pacific peoples in Aotearoa have come from or moved from, what they’re doing now, and where they want to be in the future. Together, and, with using our Pacific values as our anchor – our engagement with the Pacific community will help to lay the foundations to see where a Government agency can most benefit Pacific peoples in Aotearoa. Over this next Parliamentary term, our government and my ministry will continue striving to solidify Pacific peoples footprints in Aotearoa by providing the tools and means for Pacific peoples to be confident, thriving, resilient and prosperous.To achieve this goal, I have set a course of consolidating focus, energy and resources in delivering the Pacific Wellbeing approach across a number of Government agencies;We started this journey with Budget 2018 by building strong foundations and growing pillars that will accelerate transformational change for Pacific peoples over time.In 2018, the Minister of Finance and I released Treasury’s New Zealand/Pacific Economy report that showed Pacific peoples contribute $8 Billion to New Zealand’s GDP; that Pacific peoples volunteer 27,000 unpaid hours per week; and we hold an asset base of $8.3 Billion.  This Report will help us measure the effectiveness and impact of future Government policy.But the Pacific Wellbeing approach requires Pacific peoples to lead. To lead the design and implementation of policy. To become the authors of our own solution. For we ought to be the custodians of our own legacy.Key prioritiesI am using the Pacific Aotearoa Lalanga Fou goals to prioritise our work over the next term, with an eye towards the future.The Goal for Pacific languages and cultures is really about wanting to see your Generation being confident and thriving in our languages and culture, where bilingualism/multilingualism is valued and sought after as a competitive edge. You yourself identified this goal during the engagement process. You wanted to learn of our history, our unique stories. You wanted to see role models that look like you, sound like you, and perhaps have long names like your parents.Languages GoalThriving Pacific languages, cultures and identities are part of the fabric of who we are as a nation. They magnify the value of a community, providing a vital link between our place in Aotearoa New Zealand and our heritage as peoples of the vast blue Pacific continent. Never has there been a time where the Government, the Ministry and our Pacific community have been more united and more aligned around the Goal for Thriving Pacific languages and cultures. We want Pacific languages, cultures, and identities to be celebrated, valued and supported in Aotearoa as they are vital to Pacific peoples’ sense of wellbeing and provide the basis for Pacific communities to thrive in Aotearoa. COVID-19 has forever transformed the way we think and do things. Our experience during these extraordinary times, while challenging, has provided an opportunity to learn, reflect and refocus our priorities within our work programme and has re-affirmed the importance and value of Pacific languages, particularly on a national platform, and in keeping our people well informed and safe. My Ministry is focused on delivering a range of activities to ensure the aspirations of our Pacific communities and families for their languages, cultures and identities are realised. To ensure this happens, MPP are currently working on fully establishing the Languages Unit; advancing the Community Languages and Provider Languages and Provider Funds; advancing the Pacific Aotearoa All-of-Government Languages Framework and Strategy; advancing a regional Pacific Languages Framework; and researching the impact COVID-19 has had on Pacific churches and the role of languages as part of the communications strategy. We are also investigating the role of churches in language revitalisation; looking to deliver a refreshed Pacific Language Weeks series in 2021; and advancing the Languages Research Agenda such as a comprehensive literature review, establishment of a languages baseline indicators and measures and feasibility studies on best practice immersion-type language learning programmes, future planning and development.I have also asked the Ministry of Education to prioritise supporting Pacific language bilingual education and the existing Pacific immersion units throughout the education sector;If the wealthy nations of Europe or the high-growth economies of the Asian Tigers like Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan all use language and culture as a competitive edge, why are we not doing it? Economic ProsperityThe second goal, is where I want to see you and your peers thrive and prosper by owning assets like your own homes, and other income generating assets where you are working for yourself and collaborating with others;MPP has a number of initiatives that our Government has invested in under the Economic Prosperity Goal. We have rolled-out the expansion and implementation of TUPU Aotearoa from Northland to Southland, from Whanganui to the Hawkes Bay region. This is a collaborative initiative of my Ministry, Service Providers, and the Pacific communities, where we work together for the common goal of supporting and assisting Pacific people to find employment, complete further training or studies.TOLOA is an initiative where we aim to encourage more Pacific people into STEM-related studies and occupations. We are under underrepresented in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics for a long time and we are working hard to change this scenario. Opportunities and jobs in STEM fields will be the future for Pacific Aotearoa – and we will provide Tertiary Scholarships to New Zealand-based Pacific students who intend to study STEM-related subjects at a tertiary level and will continue to offer more scholarships going forward. In addition, we’ve set up the Toloa Community Fund to support organisations and community groups to promote and deliver STEM activities to Pacific young people, through engaging key Pacific influential groups including parents, families and community leaders.In the next three years, I’ve asked MPP to work collaboratively with Kainga Ora and our Pacific communities to find ways to accelerate Pacific home ownership. As challenging as home ownership might be, we must pursue it anyway. Home ownership gives confidence and stability to families, communities and to start addressing many of our primary health issues too.In the third goal, I want to see our communities being healthy and wealthy, where we are looking after ourselves better, living longer, & being well informed about our own health needs.I will be working with the MoH to roll out our Ola Manuia: Pacific Health Strategy. I will focus on establishing a strong workforce development pipeline, as well as working to address primary healthcare challenges. This will require good, strong partnerships with our Govt agencies, Pacific providers, our community at large, and rolling out services to regional New Zealand where Pacific populations are setting and growing.Our focus for the next year is to secure a safe and effective COVID-19 Vaccine not only for New Zealand, but also for our whanauga in the Pacific region. We will be working hard across a number of agencies to engage with our Pacific communities and leadership to ensure everyone is confident in receiving the vaccine.And our final goal is where I want to see the rising youthful Pacific population shape the future of New Zealand, where you are the creators, innovators, navigators and confident leaders of the digital economy. ConclusionTo conclude, I once again commend all of the interns on making it through the programme – though, this is not the end. We have our fair share of challenges ahead; protecting our languages, improving the pathways to employment and business, and tackling the impacts of COVID-19. You all have a part to play in providing the solutions to these challenges.I want to leave you with some final worlds. My elders often say:“E tele laau o le vao, ae e le aoga umaThere are many trees in the forest, but not all trees will fully realize it’s true worth.Some trees will be used for firewood;Some trees will be used to make spoons and bowls, or drums;Some trees will be used for weapons, or canoes;And the most special of trees are reserved for the pillars that hold up the fale”.How do we realise our true worth? Know yourself first. Find your voice. Be confident in your own beliefs and values. I believe that knowing your family history will give you confidence as you search for new horizons.Stay safe. Kia kaha, and I look forward to crossing paths with you again soon. Soifua."
2021-01-22T04:44:54Z,        Hon Phil Twyford,  Celebrating the Entry Into Force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons,"It is a great pleasure to be here this afternoon to celebrate such an historic occasion - the entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.This is a moment many feared would never come, but would rather remain forever an aspirational goal to be pursued by future generations of dreamers and idealists. It is a moment for celebration, for reflection and, above all, for hope. Today is the culmination of efforts across generations; efforts which have spanned the globe. It is a reward for the activists, academics, religious leaders, politicians and officials who never lost faith in the promise of a world without nuclear weapons.Many, if not all, of you in this room have been involved in the campaign against nuclear weapons – some of you for decades.  Today is your celebration fully as much as it is for those 50-plus governments whose ratification of the Treaty has now brought life to it.  What has been achieved together is remarkable: I hope it will serve as a source of inspiration for tackling other seemingly insurmountable challenges ahead of the world right now. New Zealand's place in nuclear disarmament advocacyFor most of us here, there is no need for advertisements for Steinlager or for McDonald’s Kiwiburger to remind us of the part nuclear disarmament has played in the evolution of New Zealand’s national identity and our independent foreign policy.  The leadership role we continue to play on nuclear disarmament has its foundation in the groundswell of public opposition to nuclear weapons, triggered by nuclear testing in the Pacific. Flotillas of private vessels sailing to disrupt the French at Mururoa; tens of thousands of signatures on the petitions presented to parliament by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (NZ); and the rolling out of self-declared nuclear weapon free zones across private properties, churches and marae, as well as suburbs and entire cities. As should be the case in a democracy, New Zealand foreign policy followed closely – with Norman Kirk’s dispatch of HMNZS Otago (with Minister Fraser Colman on board) to French Polynesia in 1973, and the first of our cases against France at the International Court of Justice in the same year.  The peace movement gathered strength in the 1980s and 1990s. As a 19 year old quite a number of my Friday nights were spent on anti-nuclear marches on Queen Street, and when then Prime Minister Robert Muldoon invited US navy vessels to Auckland we were there in sail boats and all manner of water craft to give them a Kiwi anti-nuclear welcome. The shocking bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in 1985 seared anti-nuclear sentiment into the Kiwi psyche; It was followed by the welcome establishment by treaty of a nuclear-free South Pacific in 1987; and the passage of the iconic New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament and Arms Control Act also in that same year.  In the 1990s we tried to take France again to the International Court.  With rather more success, we voted at the United Nations in favour of securing an Advisory Opinion from the Court on the legality of nuclear weapons – and then, supported by a strong showing of New Zealand civil society, lodged strong arguments with the Court on their illegality. Our advocacy for nuclear disarmament has continued at the UN, at all meetings of Parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and in the context of our strong support for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty adopted in 1996.  Most recently - just last month - I spoke (virtually) at the first ever meeting of Parties to the Treaty of Rarotonga to reinforce New Zealand’s staunch commitment to the elimination of nuclear weapons. We have worked for many years with our partners in the New Agenda Coalition to push for legally-binding measures on nuclear disarmament.  We have worked, too, as a member of the De-Alerting Group, a grouping set up during the tenure of one of my predecessors as Minister for Disarmament and Arms Control, Hon Phil Goff, here with us tonight. to promote, as a useful transitional measure, the lowering of the launch-readiness of nuclear weapons. More recently, earlier this past decade, we were one of the original group of 16 countries launching the Initiative on the Humanitarian Consequences of Nuclear Weapons.  As many of you will know, this Initiative played a critical role in putting the spotlight back on the very real human cost and risk which nuclear weapons entail.  The most telling part of the Initiative’s ‘mission statement’ is that “it is in the interest of the very survival of humanity that nuclear weapons are never used again, under any circumstances.”  I don’t think there’d be any New Zealander who would disagree with that conclusion.  Importantly, it was this Initiative which laid the foundation for the negotiation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons – the cause of our celebration this evening.   Nuclear disarmament: the current situationUnderlying the activism on disarmament by both New Zealand Governments as well as civil society from the 1970s through the 1990s was the clear and present danger posed by regional and world events at the time – the horrors of nuclear testing in the Pacific, the exponential growth of nuclear stockpiles as a result of the Cold War arms race, and the very real fear of a nuclear conflagration. In fact, government-sponsored polling in the mid-1980s revealed nuclear war to be the threat that New Zealanders were most concerned about. In comparison to this period, however, attention and activism on nuclear disarmament in recent decades has been relatively subdued, with the focus more heavily on looming environmental catastrophe including the overwhelming impacts of climate change.And yet, our work on nuclear disarmament is far from over. There are still more than 13,000 nuclear weapons in the arsenals of nine states – with the US and Russia accounting for approximately 12,000 of them.  That’s more than enough to end life on this planet many times over. Reductions in the stockpile have slowed; and in a concerning trend, some nuclear powers are now increasing the size of their arsenals. Nuclear risks are widely understood to be increasing, alongside the deterioration of the global security environment and the ongoing threats to multilateral institutions and the international rules-based order.In the past few years, major military powers appear dismissive of the contribution that disarmament and arms control can make to the building of trust and confidence and the reduction of international tensions. Instead, they have walked away from numerous multilateral and bilateral agreements that played an important role in preserving the international security environment.   Global tensions and mistrust have increased the prospect of miscalculation and escalation. Nuclear-armed states have developed military doctrines that contemplate the use of nuclear weapons in a growing number of circumstances, while continuing efforts to develop and deploy new types of nuclear weapons that would seem to lower the threshold for a nuclear conflict.  Public statements about the deployment of so-called “tactical”, “low-yield” or “more survivable” nuclear weapons – some of which are yet more powerful than the devastating bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki – indicate a deeply troubling shift away from the wisdom contained in the Reagan-Gorbachev maxim that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. At the same time, the prospect of human error has not disappeared and there is no shortage of documented “near misses” involving nuclear weapons to serve as a reminder of how close the world has come to nuclear catastrophe. Technological developments are further contributing to the already significant risks associated with nuclear weapons. Against this backdrop, it is clear that nuclear weapons continue to pose as much of a threat – if not a greater threat – than they did during the height of the Cold War. Yet, while the major powers were at that time willing and able to conclude landmark agreements intended to halt the arms race and progress nuclear disarmament, they argue now that the current environment is not conducive to such developments.  New Zealand recognises the challenges posed by the current international security environment – indeed, we work tirelessly in support of broader efforts to uphold the international rules-based order and multilateralism, and to address specific proliferation challenges including Iran and North Korea.  But we cannot entrap ourselves in a catch-22 scenario whereby progress on disarmament is made contingent upon improvements in the broader security context – at the very same time as that context is actually being aggravated by the absence of such progress. As we have stated previously with our New Agenda Coalition partners, “there is a direct causal link between the retention of nuclear weapons and possible attempts to acquire them. The dynamic of an arms race has always been that possession provides the incentive for acquisition; proliferation begets proliferation.”  It is a grim and unsettling outlook that explains why the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons is needed now more than ever.And it is why today it is so encouraging that the Biden Administration has announced it is seeking a five year extension of the New START treaty with Russia.  Without this the treaty would have lapsed in February, removing any limit on the number of Russian and US nuclear-armed submarines, bombers and missiles, with all the consequences that would have for a nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament.It is our sincere hope the new Administration will re-engage seriously on nuclear disarmament, and carry forward implementation of article VI of the NPT, and recommit to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iran nuclear deal). We hope that all nuclear weapons possessors will find a pathway to support and ultimately sign up to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear WeaponsI referred before to other pressing global issues, such as climate change, which have now tended to displace nuclear disarmament from the primary place it has held on the agenda for many activists over past decades.  Within New Zealand, I think it’s clear that the end to nuclear testing in the Pacific has seen an overall decline in the public and media focus directed at issues relating to nuclear disarmament.  I want to reassure you, however, that the Government’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon-free world will continue.  Whether or not it may be in the forefront of their minds, New Zealanders remain firmly opposed to weapons we see both as most inhumane, and also now illegal.I can count on all of you here to know exactly why I am referring now to these weapons as “illegal”.  The Treaty of which we are today celebrating the entry into force – the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons – follows in the path of many other highly significant treaties (like those relating to Chemical and Biological Weapons and those dealing with Landmines and Cluster Munitions).  For those countries who join the TPNW nuclear weapons are from now on – in all contexts and for all purposes – illegal as a matter of international law.  The Treaty has therefore closed what was often referred to as the ‘legal gap’ on nuclear weapons: it has given us the legal framing for a nuclear weapon-free world.      Let me give you a very brief outline of some key provisions of the TPNW.  Article 1 of the Treaty establishes a comprehensive prohibition – applicable to any State joining the Treaty - against the full spectrum of nuclear weapon-related activities. Article 2 is a transparency measure.  Declarations are required from all States Parties as to whether or not they possess nuclear weapons anywhere on their territory.  New Zealand will shortly be sending its Article 2 Declaration in to the UN Secretary-General - and I don’t need to tell you that it won’t entail any difficult legal drafting!  Article 3 requires Parties to maintain the same standard of nuclear safeguards that they have in place under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) or, if they do not already have an IAEA comprehensive safeguards agreement in place, they must proceed to do so.   Articles 6 and 7 deal with “Victim Assistance and Environmental Remediation”. Article 6 requires Parties whose persons or territory have been affected by the use or testing of nuclear weapons to provide adequate assistance (including medical care and psychological support) and to take appropriate measures towards the environmental remediation of contaminated areas.  These obligations are without prejudice to the duties and obligations owed by any other States.   Article 7 provides that Parties in a position to do so must provide assistance to other Parties that have been affected by nuclear weapons or nuclear testing and for their victims.  It also recognises that a Party that has used or tested nuclear weapons has a responsibility to provide adequate assistance for the purpose of victim assistance and environmental remediation. Ladies and gentlemen - that’s a very quick and, necessarily, selective overview of the TPNW.  We are proud to have played our part in bringing this Treaty to life.  In doing so, it was certainly a privilege to work alongside other likeminded countries and for us all to be able to draw on the commitment and vision of global civil society – led by the Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons – as well as that of international organisations like the International Committee of the Red Cross. Today is an important milepost on the road to nuclear disarmament. Of course the nuclear armed states are not going to relinquish their nuclear arsenals tomorrow. But when an overwhelming majority of the community of nations, global civil society, scientists, faith leaders, and public opinion all say that nuclear weapons are not only morally and ethically wrong but wrong and prohibited under international law, then it becomes more difficult to sustain the argument that they make us safer. It also becomes more difficult for members of the nuclear club to talk as if they are meeting their disarmament obligations under the NPT, while at the same time modernising their arsenals and allowing hard-fought disarmament agreements to lapse. The futureIn committing to champion this Treaty and to advocate for its universalisation and implementation, New Zealand will, at the same time, be maintaining our full support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  We will work with all its Parties to achieve a meaningful outcome from this year’s Review Conference – and will continue our collaboration with the cross-regional groups of which we are a part and which share our commitment to moving forward on nuclear disarmament.  We will continue, too, our committed advocacy for the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.   But, rather than look too much into the crystal ball of the future, for now I would like to close by registering New Zealand’s pleasure, in company with so many of our Pacific Island partners, to be among the first 50 ratifiers of the TPNW – part of the grouping, therefore, which has secured its entry into force - today.  Please join me in putting your hands together in tribute to all the mahi by so many people over so many years to produce this historic achievement.Note to editors: Please note that the speech as delivered may differ slightly from this text."
2020-12-08T01:06:19Z,        Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern,  Prime Minister’s comments on Royal Commission of Inquiry into Christchurch Terror Attack ,"The Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Terror Attack in Christchurch on March 15 has delivered a comprehensive report that will form the basis of a significant work programme to make New Zealand a safer and ultimately I hope, a more cohesive country.When we set up the inquiry I said I wanted no stone left unturned to find out how the March 15 attack happened, what could have been done to stop it and how we can keep New Zealanders safe.Today we have answers. On the matters of how the attack occurred and what could have been done to stop it the Commission found no failures within any Government agencies that would have allowed the terrorists planning and preparation to be detected. But they did identify many lessons to be learnt and significant areas needing change.There are two in particular I wish to highlight. The first are the failings within the firearms licensing regime. Commissioner Coster will speak to these directly at the conclusion of my comments.  The second area relates to our security and intelligence agencies. For many years the Muslim community has raised concerns over the disproportionate scrutiny by security and intelligence agencies.  As one member of the community put it to me recently, they could only assume that same level of scrutiny was being applied to those who may have posed a threat to their security. The report confirms that there was an “inappropriate concentration of resources.” The report specifically notes that before 2018, the concentration of resources was not based on an informed assessment of the threats of terrorism associated with other ideologies.  While the commission made no findings that these issues would have stopped the attack, these were failings none the less, and for that on behalf the government, I apologise.In addition, the report also discusses the permissive firearms regime that persisted in New Zealand for many decades.  It talks about the Thorp report in the 1990s, and that “deficiencies in the firearms licencing system had been recognised in a number of reports and reviews. Despite that, changes were not made until March 15, and for that we must take responsibility. After all, the Police can only be held to account for the laws they enforce and the manner in which they enforce them. The fact that the first thing we moved on in the aftermath of March 15 was our gun laws, speaks to how important we believed change in this area was. As the report itself states “for the most part, the issues we have identified with the firearms licensing system were recognised and understood by the New Zealand Police before 15 March 2019, and have been addressed by legislation passed after 15 March 2019.”Ultimately, this roughly 800 page report can be distilled into one simple premise. Muslim New Zealanders should be safe. Anyone who calls New Zealand home, regardless of race, religion, sex or sexual orientation should be safe. New Zealanders deserve a system that does its best to keep you safe, and that is what we are committed to building. But an apology would be hollow without action. So in order to ensure New Zealanders are safer the Government has agreed in principle with all 44 recommendations contained in the report. I want to run through some of the major decisions the Government has made immediately. This is not a comprehensive list. We have balanced here the calls from the community to move quickly and not start with yet another blank sheet of paper, with the calls to also engage on issues where we need to tread carefully in the design and implementation of recommendations.Firstly, there must be accountability for the follow through on the report.  The Commission has suggested that a Minister be appointed to coordinate the implementation of the report’s recommendations. Cabinet has determined that Andrew Little will be the coordinating Minister. His experience as the past Minister of Justice, his understanding of the security and intelligence agencies, his seniority, and experience working across Maoridom for instance as Treaty Negotiations Minister makes him well placed to take on this role. Each minister will however retain the responsibility for the work programme in their portfolio. The report has a number of recommendations for how Government can better support our diverse communities, build greater social cohesion and support those directly affected by the attack.The ongoing impact of March 15 will be long lasting. The Government will establish a wraparound services as part of the ongoing recovery support for affected whanau, survivors and witnesses of the attack. In line with recommendation 30 of the report the Government will establish a Ministry for Ethnic Communities. The elevation of what was formally the Office for Ethnic Communities has been a longstanding ambition of the diverse range of ethnic communities we have in New Zealand. Minister Radikrishnan will as both the Minister for Inclusion, Diversity and Ethnic Communities, as well as an Associate Social Development Minister, lead the work on social cohesion. I will play a role in supporting her in that work. The report makes clear the need for leadership in this area, it’s a call we all accept.  In response to long standing calls to ensure greater diversity in our policy work and decision making, we will establish an Ethnic Communities’ Graduate Programme to provide work experience and pathways into the public service. I want to come now to an area that has been in need of reform since well before the terrorist attack on March 15. There are many groups of people in New Zealand who do not feel safe due to threats and victimisation that most New Zealanders don’t ever encounter. I think most of us would find hate fuelled behaviour unacceptable, and totally against who we are, and what we aspire to be as a nation. The report recommends a range of initiatives in this space – some we will act on immediately, some we will spend some time working with Parliament and New Zealanders on. We will establish the New Zealand Police programme Te Raranga, The Weave, to make improvements in Police’s frontline practice to identify, record, and manage hate crime, and deliver a service that is more responsive to victims.We will also increase the capacity of the Human Rights Commission by increasing the funding so they can develop a team of highly skilled individuals who can provide mediation, facilitate conversations or be more proactive in exercising the Commission’s inquiry function.We also propose to continue our work to update our current hate speech legislation. We are conscious there are a range of views on this issue. We will be undertaking consultation with community groups and parties from right across Parliament to test these proposals before bringing forward legislative change. I do want to emphasise though, these are issues that are longstanding, they predate March 15, and they effect many members of the community, including our LGBTIQ community, and different and diverse religions. We will take the time to get it right. There are also a number of recommendations to strengthen our counter-terrorism laws and operations. We will be progressing amendments to the Terrorism Suppression Act that amongst a number of changes creates a new offence to criminalise planning or preparation for a terrorist act, creating a new offence to more clearly criminalise terrorist weapons and combat training, creating a new offence for international travel with the intention to carry out terrorist activities and extending the eligibility for a control order to include individuals who have completed a prison sentence for a terrorism-related offence if they continue to present a real risk of engaging in terrorism-related activities. These are issues we have been working on for some time, as the report notes. And New Zealand will sign up to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, an international treaty seeking to address internet and computer crime, by aligning nations’ laws, facilitating information-sharing on current threats and sharing best practice. These are just a few areas of work amongst many others. You will see a longer list in your packs, and of course the complete list in the principles of what the commission has recommended. From here a multi-agency Response Steering Group has been set up to provide a report to Government in the first quarter of 2021 that will include an Implementation Roadmap for the report’s recommendations.Before concluding I want to remark briefly on the role of social media. You will be aware of the work we did in the aftermath of the attack to address some of these issues – that work is not complete. For me the report only further reinforced the need to continue. What particularly stood out was the statement that the terrorist claimed that he was “not a frequent commenter on extreme right-wing sites and that YouTube was, for him, a more significant source of information and inspiration.” This is a point I plan to make directly to the leadership of YouTube. Finally, I want to thank the Royal Commission for its thorough work. It has been a massive undertaking and the result will help strengthen New Zealand’s Counter-Terrorism system as well as enhance cohesion across our communities. But I want to leave my final words for the Muslim community. Thank you for the part you have played in ensuring this Royal Commission was comprehensive and contains practical actions that can now be put in place, to protect, care for and look after everyone. In the wake of such pain, I know that has been one of your goals. Now it’s up to all of us to make that a reality. "
2020-12-03T20:00:41Z,        Hon Damien O'Connor,  Speech to Auckland Trade and Economic Policy School ,"CHECK AGAINST DELIVERYThank you for the opportunity to speak today. I want to recognise the hard work of the University of Auckland’s Public Policy Institute in putting on this event. Bringing together internationally recognised leaders and thinkers on trade and economic policy, with exporters, business leaders, diplomats, economists, academics, and government is essential to ensuring New Zealand’s trade policy is benefitting all New Zealanders and is constructively debated. I’m looking forward to a stimulating discussion here today. The Government’s PrioritiesI want to begin by emphasising the central role of trade in the Government’s wider work programme over this coming term.We find ourselves at a time of unparalleled international crisis. The world faces the greatest public health emergency since the global flu pandemic a century ago.  The ensuing economic shock represents the largest global downturn since the Great Depression.In the face of this, the Prime Minister recently laid out our three overarching objectives as a Government:To keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19To accelerate our economic recovery; andTo lay the foundations for a better future.Trade is crucial to our success in meeting all three of these objectives. We are a global exporter, based at the bottom of the world. Imports and exports are our lifeblood – essential to our quality of life and our wellbeing. Prior to the pandemic, about half of all New Zealand jobs came from the tradeable sector. Firms in the tradeable sector are 54% more productive; they employ more New Zealanders when they start exporting; and they pay more compared to firms in the non-tradeable sector.The pandemic has also brought into stark relief just how essential imports are to New Zealand’s economic success and wellbeing. Imports of COVID-19 testing kits and PPE; and imports as inputs in to our own production processes are critical. New Zealand businesses operate as part of complex international supply chains, and the risk that a loss of air connectivity posed to our people, and our economy, during COVID-19 underscores how vital trade is to New Zealand. But throughout this pandemic, our trade has held up remarkably well. Merchandise exports have largely kept pace with, or exceeded, last year’s, which is incredible during one of the biggest recessions the global economy has seen.And just as we have seen exports lead us through the worst of this crisis, it’s my intention that exports will lead our recovery from it.Our successful response to COVID-19 provides New Zealand with a unique opportunity to position ourselves globally as a safe and secure place to trade with, to invest in, and eventually, to visit again. That’s why we’ve developed our Trade Recovery Strategy and our Trade for All Agenda, to seize this opportunity, accelerate New Zealand’s economic recovery, and lay the foundations for a better future.Global HeadwindsBut make no mistake, New Zealand faces a very challenging global trade landscape today. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, New Zealand faced significant headwinds in global trade. The World Trade Organisation, and its system of trade rules which puts small countries like ours on an even footing with global powers, has been under growing pressure on a number of fronts. Protectionism and strategic competition, most notably between China and the US, has threatened the stability of international trade. The escalating tariff disputes between the US and China caused trade to fall sharply, with global ramifications.  As a small, export-oriented economy, it is hard to overstate the importance to New Zealand of a trading system underpinned by rules rather than economic influence – or an economic ‘might is right’ attitude.  The COVID-19 PandemicCOVID-19 has unfortunately exacerbated many of the international challenges that we already faced. COVID-19 responses around the globe have disappointingly been accompanied by a sharp increase in trade distortions - most commonly increases in subsidies.  These make it harder for New Zealand to compete fairly.     We have seen the effect of these distortions in global trade flows. Initial estimates for the second quarter of 2020 - when the virus and lockdowns spread around the world - indicated a year‑on‑year drop of around 18.5% in the volume of global merchandise trade.  New Zealand GDP contracted by 2.0 percent in the June 2020 year. This was a much better economic performance than many expected back in February and March. Indeed, since June we’ve seen our economic performance continue to outstrip expectations, with measures such as the Treasury’s New Zealand Activity Index showing economic activity levels in October higher than the same time last year.However, given recent second waves of COVID-19 in many parts of the world, Treasury now expects the global impacts of COVID-19 to weigh on us for longer, and is forecasting a contraction of 0.5% in 2021.   Our ResponseIn the face of these challenges we have been clear that the COVID-19 response and recovery is our top priority for New Zealand. New Zealand’s health approach has been world-leading, and we can see the benefits of the ‘team of 5 million’ going hard, and going early. As much of the rest of the world goes back in to hard lockdown, we are largely free to meet, to do business, to see our whanau, and to attend events like this in person. This is proof that the best economic response has been a public health response. It is clear that trade has the potential to drive our broader economic recovery from COVID-19. That is why we are implementing our Trade Recovery Strategy. Trade Recovery StrategyOur Trade Recovery Strategy consists of four pillars of work – the four ‘R’s’ - to position New Zealand to recover from the economic impacts of the pandemic.Retooling Support for exportersFirst, we need to put New Zealand companies in the best possible position to recover markets quickly, and to seize new opportunities.The Government is providing the tools, support, and market intelligence to allow those businesses that are thriving through the pandemic to build on this success, whilst giving those that have endured harsh market shocks the information and tools to rebuild and find new opportunities. We have already rolled out a significant amount of support, including:NZTE more than doubling the number of ‘Focus’ companies it works with, and providing support to many more businesses through the new ‘My NZTE’ online portal for support. Over 9,000 companies, including over 800 Māori businesses, have received COVID-19 Business Advisory Support worth around $30 million, through the regional business partner network. NZTE has significantly built up its in-market team to provide greater support to exporters who are not able to travel.  And MFAT has published over 100 market intelligence reports providing insights on COVID-19 developments in a range of countries.MFAT has also established a Trade Recovery Unit dedicated to supporting the COVID-19 trade recovery, by resolving trade barriers that businesses are finding; working to ensure the security of supply chains and address COVID‑19 disruptions to trade; and launching a new tool to help services exporters navigate off-shore markets. Reinvigorating the international trade architectureThe second pillar of the Trade Recovery Strategy is reinvigorating the international trade architecture, which we are doing through a number of avenues. One such avenue is of course the WTO, which remains the premier institution through which we can influence international trade rules.  Another is through Free Trade Agreements, which build our international connectivity. Just last month I signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement for New Zealand - an agreement between 15 economies that are home to almost a third of the world’s population and take over half of New Zealand’s exports. RCEP is estimated to add $186 billion to the world economy, and increase New Zealand’s GDP by around $2 billion once fully implemented.New Zealand also recently signed the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement with Singapore and Chile. COVID-19 has demonstrated the value of our digital economy, and the DEPA will encourage further growth of our digital trading relationships.We have launched FTA negotiations with the UK, and already held two rounds of negotiations. We are also continuing negotiations with the EU, New Zealand’s third largest export market; and we hope to sign an upgrade to New Zealand’s FTA with China soon.  If all of New Zealand’s current FTA negotiations are successfully concluded, and enter into force, they will cover around 76% of our exports of goods and services.To support the international trade architecture we are also developing what are termed ‘open plurilateral agreements’, such as the DEPA and the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade and Sustainability, or ACCTS. The ACCTS was launched last year by our Prime Minister and it is a trade agreement that will drive the reform of fossil fuels subsidies and lower the cost of environmental goods and services. These are agreements in areas important to New Zealand, which sustain and build upon existing trade rules. They are also designed as vehicles that other countries can join on to in future. Our hosting of APEC in 2021 is also a key component of our trade recovery. I will touch on this in greater detail later.  Refreshing key trade relationshipsRefreshing key trade relationships is the third pillar of the Trade Recovery Strategy. This means furthering trade diversification to provide exporters with more options, building our national brand and reputation, and providing new and strengthened FTAs. It also involves me getting on ‘Zoom’ and connecting with my counterparts internationally. I am doing a lot of these meetings at all hours of the day and night! Resilience: Building New Zealand’s Strategic Economic ResilienceThe final pillar of the strategy is to build New Zealand’s resilience to future global disruptions. New Zealand is dependent on foreign suppliers for many critical products. This puts us at risk in situations that impact our connectivity – as we have seen. This thinking is not about wholesale on-shoring of production, or stockpiling, but about what New Zealand, and the New Zealand economy, needs to keep working.   These four R’s are the heart of our strategy to put New Zealand exporters in the best possible position to build back better in this challenging time. Looking out beyond COVID-19 and the immediate impacts on the New Zealand economy, trade will remain absolutely crucial to building the New Zealand economy, and to improving the well-being of all New Zealanders. The challenges that we faced before COVID-19 will not disappear overnight. New Zealand has a six part strategic framework to tackle these systemic challenges, which builds off many of the strands of New Zealand’s trade recovery that I have mentioned here. In the medium term we need to continue to:support the WTO; embed New Zealand in key economic architecture through FTAs; pursue a programme of concerted open plurilateralism;support global public goods that enable trade norms – such as APEC and the OECD; support New Zealand businesses to succeed offshore; and enhance our engagement with the public on trade, so trade policy reflects the needs and views of New Zealanders.Continuing this important work is central to maintaining a global trading system that is fair, and provides opportunities for New Zealand businesses to thrive. But the immediate focus of this Government remains COVID-19 – our health response, and our work to drive the economic recovery. What Next? Making Trade for All RealThe other critical piece in thinking about ‘where to next’ for New Zealand trade policy is our work to ensure that trade delivers for all New Zealanders. What we call our ‘Trade for All’ agenda is foundational - it underpins all of our trade policy, and is essential if trade is to be successful and sustainable. The Trade for All process involved extensive consultation around the country, culminating in recommendations from an advisory board on the future of New Zealand trade policy. Cabinet agreed earlier this year to implement them in three tranches - short, medium and longer term actions. We immediately began work to do so. With COVID-19 having since intervened, we were clear that whatever was done to drive our trade and economic recovery must be underpinned by the principles of Trade for All. The sum of the Trade for All process is a trade policy that recognises and respects those things that are important to New Zealand - that is more consultative and that shares the benefits of trade more widely so that they are felt amongst all New Zealanders. It is a trade policy that supports greater engagement and inclusion. And one that ensures that the things that New Zealanders care about – like the environment; labour rights; and gender equality – are reflected in our trade policy. It is a trade policy that fundamentally recognises the role and voice of Māori as treaty partners. We need to ensure the strength of the Māori economy and its trade and investment potential are supported, and that trade delivers for Māori.It is a trade policy that supports those institutions and mechanisms that are central to New Zealand’s prosperity through trade - the WTO and its rules-based system, FTAs and regional trade architecture, and open plurilateralism. It is a trade policy that supports New Zealand companies to internationalise. And it is a trade policy that works to ensure that the benefits from trade are being shared more evenly to all New Zealanders.  Our goal is a trade policy that works to support sustainable and inclusive economic development – a ‘triple bottom line’ approach of social, economic and environmental wellbeing. This work is absolutely fundamental and the Government is committed to taking it forward.APEC 2021Now I want to talk specifically about New Zealand’s hosting of APEC in 2021. APEC is hugely relevant to both our trade recovery, and our efforts to make sure trade is delivering for more people. Hosting APEC is a once in a generation chance to be a regional leader on trade and economic integration. It’s an opportunity that is occurring at an incredibly important juncture for New Zealand, and for global trade. The impact of COVID-19 on the Asia-Pacific’s people and economy, coupled with the decision to host an entirely virtual year, makes APEC 2021 an ambitious exercise in digital diplomacy. As New Zealand takes on the Chair of APEC – and our first meeting will be happening next week - we will be asking three things of APEC economies:To join together: that is to reignite growth and plan for a long-lasting economic recovery.To work together: so we can show leadership and innovation to work for the collective good; andTo grow together: so we will foster prosperity and well-being that is sustainable, inclusive and digitally-enabled.APEC’s strength has always been in its ability to bring people together, to share experiences and ideas, and to test practical solutions to shared economic and human challenges.The response to COVID-19, and all the economic disruption that it brings, necessitates a coordinated response in the Asia-Pacific region. In the context of unprecedented economic challenges, and growing friction among participants, APEC’s core role as a non-binding ”incubator” of ideas, and regional trade and economic norms, is more important ever.We want to continue APEC's work on digital; on regional integration; on economic policies that are inclusive of women, SMEs and indigenous business; and of course on sustainability. We are also placing our focus on ensuring trade benefits all people at the heart of our APEC work.The disruptions caused by COVID-19 – through strained supply chains; export restrictions; and an increase in trade barriers – have also increased food security challenges in the region, and globally. Trade allows economies to focus on their areas of comparative advantage - to produce food where it is most efficient, and transport it to where it is needed. As a net food exporter New Zealand has an important role to play. As part of our APEC host year, New Zealand will lead the task of developing APEC’s new post-2020 Food Security Roadmap. Our goal for this work will be to support a robust, well-functioning and sustainable food system for the Asia-Pacific. We expect the Roadmap to guide APEC economies to leverage structural reforms in order to help re-tool food producers to engage in trade recovery; to promote the deployment of digital tools to enhance supply chain efficiency; and to address trade barriers and other trade-distorting practices faced by food exporters in the region.Given all that is going on in the world, there could hardly be a more important time to reinvigorate APEC’s work, and build on APEC’s brand new 20-year Vision, and that is precisely what we plan to do in hosting APEC 2021.ConclusionI want to conclude by reiterating that while New Zealand faces a challenging and turbulent time in our trade policy, COVID-19 remains this Government’s top priority and trade will be at the forefront of our economic recovery. We are committed to working closely with exporters to provide the support they need to navigate these unprecedented challenges, and to recover and grow. And we will defend those international institutions and structures that allow a small country like ours to trade fairly.We will implement our significant agenda of work to ensure that trade, going forward, delivers for more New Zealanders; recognises those things that we as New Zealanders hold dear; and reflects the viewpoints of Māori as our Treaty partners. This work will help ensure that New Zealand emerges from COVID-19 better than before, and can continue to address the longer term challenges to global trade that we face. Thank you."
2020-11-30T22:02:43Z,        Hon Nanaia Mahuta,  Speech at APEC 21 Opening Pōwhiri ,"9am, Tuesday 1 DecemberTe Whare Waka o Pōneke, Wellington CentralHe MihiKei aku rangatira no ngātapito e whā o te ao huri noa, tātou e huihui mai nei.

Kaupapa i tāwhia I te āo. Pai Mārire.Opening commentsI, along with my fellow ministerial colleagues, am pleased to be here today as we symbolically welcome representatives of APEC member economies to Aotearoa New Zealand’s host year.I want to also take this opportunity to acknowledge mana whenua, Te Atiawa Iwi who have warmly welcomed us, Local representatives of APEC economies ; Deputy Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and Papua New Guinea High Commissioner, His Excellency Brigadier General Francis Agwi, speaking on behalf of economy representatives at this pōwhiri; Māori business and peak body representatives; and non-government organisationsThrough Malaysian High Commissioner, Your Excellency Ms Nur Izzah Wong Mee Choo (Noor Iz-ZAH WONG May Chew), I take this opportunity to congratulate Malaysia on successfully concluding its host year – despite significant disruptions – with agreement to the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040.It is significant to note that around 700 years ago, our ocean navigating Māori ancestors or tūpuna traversed the vast Pacific Ocean, using the signs they observed in the stars and ocean currents to travel south to ultimately arrive here in Aotearoa. I hazard a guess that they would have stopped off at many of your homelands across the Pacific along the way to rest, recuperate and re-stock supplies for the long journey ahead. So as we welcome you here today, we acknowledge the ancestral connections we share and welcome you as whānau, as family. Whare Waka - the dwelling place of canoes - is an appropriate venue for such a welcome. New Zealand’s Host YearWe would like our host year to be as engaging as it possibly can be. We seek to promote trade and economic growth that is inclusive, especially as it relates to women and indigenous peoples, to ensure APEC makes full use of the untapped economic potential of these and a number of other groups. We will also focus on sustainability, not only in response to environmental realities such as climate change, but also to facilitate a green economic recovery from COVID-19. Although the scope and scale of the task ahead is unchartered territory, we are up for the challenge and I am confident we have the necessary provisions in place to engage effectively with our APEC colleagues and deliver a successful virtual host year, building on the success of our Malaysian colleagues in 2020.APEC New Zealand Officials are working in partnership with the local tangata whenua, Te Atiawa Iwi, to ensure that we maintain our Māori cultural integrity in the way that we welcome, host and farewell our manuwhiri, our guests. As you may well recognise these are challenging and uncertain times. A global pandemic has cause us to be caught in the same storm and while we are experiencing the impact of this storm very differently collectively we know we must get through the other side.Responding to COVID-19 will be top of mind for New Zealand, and we will be looking to use a number of mechanisms to facilitate an effective, long-lasting economic response to the crisis as we set out a “new normal” approach to support our resilience.Following the biggest economic shock in 90 years, we will focus on rebuilding confidence in the multilateral trading system. An effective, functioning and rules-based multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organisation at its centre, underpins APEC’s work to support our economies to grow together and be cognisant of the challenge before us. Promoting indigenous collaboration to broaden the diversity of our approach, and the consequent benefits to women and young people is also important.Māori Economic Growth and APECAs I reflect on New Zealand’s last hosting of APEC in 1999, I am heartened by the progress we have made since then. In 1999, Māori were largely invisible in New Zealand’s hosting and were mostly reduced to ceremonial and cultural roles. However, we are determined that for APEC21, Māori will play a more prominent and meaningful role in New Zealand’s hosting. I anticipate this approach may assist broader opportunities for indigenous peoples and economies to connect in more meaningful ways.Over the last twenty years the Māori economy and asset base has grown exponentially enhanced further by Treaty Settlements, which have provided an economic base for our people. Today, the Māori economy is valued at around $50 billion and represents six per cent of New Zealand’s total asset base. The Māori economy includes a range of authorities, businesses, and SME employers who self-identify as Māori.From 2010 to 2018, Māori enterprises have increased in number by over 30 percent and employee count by 50 percent. However, the general consensus is that further diversification of the Māori asset base is required to ensure resilience in the long-term.  We are starting to see this across the Māori economy with Māori businesses branching out into new investment areas including geothermal, digital, education, and housing.With the Māori economy in such a solid position, we have an excellent opportunity to diversify the benefits our trade policy and within APEC over the next twenty years. However I acknowledge that indigenous recognition can be a sensitive subject and that the New Zealand experience is not uniformly replicated across the Asia-Pacific. We are willing to share our experience and offer support to assist economies to enable the greater participation of indigenous communities in trade and economic activity, including through APEC. Economic inclusion such as this approach will contribute to greater equity and opportunity for indigenous peoples and can contribute to greater social cohesion and stability in our region..Join, Work, Grow. TogetherAs we move ahead together, we will need to Join, Work and Grow, Together – this can be reflected in the Māori kīanga or saying “Haumi ē, hui ē, tāiki ē”. These words speak to APEC’s greatest strength: providing a space for its 21 economies to join together, and work collaboratively towards our collective future growth. For you, our locally-based APEC economy representatives, the virtual nature of our host year will mean that you will play an even more important connecting role between New Zealand officials and your home agencies.For our New Zealand Government officials, you have an enormous task ahead as you work to prepare proposals, meeting papers, statements, projects and events during New Zealand’s host year, all while ensuring a strong New Zealand sense of manaakitanga, hospitality.For tangata whenua, Te Atiawa Iwi, and our Māori organisation partners, you are our Treaty partner and represent Māori cultural and economic interests in APEC and what we strive to achieve across these economies.Closing commentsFinally let me draw upon the wisdom of my ancestor Tāwhio who said; Ki te kotahi te kākaho ka whati, ki te kapuia e kore e whati.""When a reed stands alone it can be easily broken, but bound in unison it stands firm, joined together, and is unbreakable!""That is the intent of APEC 21 that we Join, Work and Grow Together.No reira, Turuturu Whakawhitia mau a kia tina! Haumi e, hui e, tāiki e! Tēnā koutou. Tēnā koutou. Tēnā tātou katoa!ENDS        [CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY]"
2020-11-27T23:21:06Z,        Hon Marama Davidson,"  Opening Address, Pacific Women’s Watch (New Zealand) Annual Conference on Disability – Creating a level playing field between ALL women in Aotearoa New Zealand","One of the greatest opportunities to improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders is to reduce New Zealand’s high rates of violence and ultimately to reduce and stop family violence and sexual violence altogether. Family violence and sexual violence adversely affects children and adults with impacts across generations, on health, on wellbeing, in communities, in our society generally. There are many great contributors to the disability sector at this conference, and one of those is Disability Rights Commissioner, Paula Tesoriero. I know she met the Joint Venture in September, and without wishing to get ahead of Paula and what she will contribute to this conference today, I was struck by some of the numbers she presented in that meeting. She cited the fact that disabled people experience twice the rate of violence faced by non-disabled people, rising to three times for children, and four to ten times for sexual violence towards disabled women and girls. Those numbers – those truly appalling numbers – should bring us all up short. They simply must be addressed by us all. And I can tell you they increase my determination to make a difference as I begin this role. As you know, I am the newly appointed Minister for the Prevention of Family and Sexual Violence. I’m here to listen to you and I am here to learn from you. I want to know more from your perspective about the issues and the challenges; the problems and the potential solutions. Yesterday, I attended the White Ribbon breakfast, hosted by Police Commissioner Andrew Coster. It was a good opportunity to meet key players who, no doubt, share many aspects of your journey. The Joint Venture was established at the end of 2018 as an innovative approach to addressing what we all know is a complex system problem. Its creation is essentially a recognition of the need for systemic and transformational change. The Joint Venture model itself is about creating collective responsibility, oversight and leadership of action. I will emphasise that last bit again – leadership of action. Let that be a signal of where I intend to go as Minister. So why do government agencies need to work differently? Previous attempts at improving the system involved voluntary collaboration across government. This approach did not significantly improve the fragmented system – a system that was seen to be overly complex and unreliable by the people trying to secure their own safety or get help to change their behaviour. What are government agencies are doing differently? Joint Venture agencies have been tasked with working together where a joint response can make the biggest difference to reducing the impact of family violence and sexual violence on current and future New Zealanders. The Joint Venture has supported investment decisions by Ministers by looking at the whole family violence and sexual violence system, especially through Budgets 2019 and 2020 and most recently the Joint Venture led the government’s response to risks of family violence and sexual violence during the COVID-19 response. Of the ten Joint Venture agencies, a number of them – including Health, the Ministry of Social Development, Oranga Tamariki, ACC, Police and Corrections – either have specific disability initiatives in the FVSV area or are have work underway on their approach to disability issues. It is still fairly early days in this model. Joint Venturing is an innovative and new way of working and in some respects is still bedding in, but we need to expect – we need to demand, in government and outside of it – that we start to the make that difference we talk about, and that we start to see more results. A priority for me is leading our Joint Venture to focus work on building the capability and capacity of our agencies and in communities to provide safe and targeted responses for all, with particular focus on disabled people and your communities. I know that there is little to no specialist violence services available for disabled people and this is something our Officials are working right now to address.  In closing, I would like to acknowledge my predecessor in this role, my colleague Jan Logie, and I would like to acknowledge the foundations she has laid, particularly in the work of the Joint Venture, and her absolute commitment to the critical mahi that we have to do to reduce and stop family violence and sexual violence, and especially to eliminate it as a blight on the lives of those living with disabilities.We have much to talk about and even more to do. I am absolutely committed to the mahi ahead, and I look forward to working closely with you. Good luck with this conference today. "
2020-11-25T23:59:03Z,        No Minister,  Speech from the throne ,"E aku hoa i te ara o te whai,Kia kotahi tā tātou takahi i te kō, ko tōku whiwhi kei tō koutou tautoko mai.Ko tāku ki a koutou, hei whakapiki manawa mōku.He horomata rangatira te mahi, e rite ai te whiwhinga a te ringatuku, me te ringakape ake, i ōna painga.Hei ruruhau, hei kaitoko i te ora, hei kaiurungi, hei kaiwhakaawe taumata hou.He mea pai, i oti tahiNāu, nāku, nā tātou. Honourable Members of the House of Representatives.It is my privilege to exercise the prerogative of Her Majesty the Queen and open the 53rd Parliament.In the October election, New Zealanders elected a majority Government for the first time under our Mixed Member Proportional electoral system.The Government not only enjoys the confidence of a clear majority of members in the House of Representatives, it is also privileged to have the confidence of a majority of New Zealanders who voted in the general election.The Labour Government took Office when I swore in the Prime Minister the Right Honourable Jacinda Ardern.New Zealanders voted for stability and certainty at the election.  They have placed huge trust and responsibility in the Labour Government by providing it with a majority mandate to implement the policies it set out during the campaign, while responding to the issues that will inevitably arise, and bringing to bear the same values and strong leadership established in its first term.To add further stability to the New Zealand Government, the Labour Party has agreed to work together with the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand through a Cooperation Agreement.  This agreement commits the Government to working in the best interests of New Zealand and New Zealanders, working to honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi, and working together on specific policy areas where the Green Party can continue to add expertise and where both parties can achieve mutual gains that advance the goals of the Government.The Labour Government takes office at a time of unparalleled international crisis. It faces the greatest public health emergency since the global flu pandemic a century ago.  The ensuing economic shock represents the largest global downturn since the Great Depression.The health risk posed by the pandemic is greater now than it was when we first closed our borders.  The global economic outlook continues to worsen.New Zealand will not be immune to these deteriorating conditions.In this year of crisis, protecting New Zealand and the lives and livelihoods of New Zealanders has been the urgent and abiding consideration. It remains so.But that does not mark the full extent of what a government can do, and it does not mark the full extent of what this government means to do.Crises do not form an orderly line waiting to be addressed. Three of the country’s longest-standing and hardest issues demand continued and determined action: affordable housing and homelessness, child poverty, and the global climate crisis.On each of these areas there is a need to do more and go further.  Problems that are decades in the making are not easily or quickly solved.  But this Government is committed to relentlessly pursuing progress.The government means to build on the foundations laid in the first term.  New Zealand must continue to tackle these issues, at gathering scale, at gathering speed, and with gathering effect.The Labour Government will have three overarching objectives:To keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19To accelerate our economic recoveryTo lay the foundations for a better futureThe scale and pace of the recovery offers an opportunity to reshape the way things are done in New Zealand, to innovate and improve our position and our economy.New Zealand’s success in fighting the virus means we are better positioned for recovery than many other countries.  Already we have seen employment, export and growth numbers that are better than expected.The programme outlined today seeks to make the most of our head start.Keeping New Zealanders Safe from COVID-19The first objective of the Government will be to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID.  In keeping New Zealanders safe, we protect jobs, livelihoods, and strengthen our economy.  A strong health response has given the New Zealand economy the best chance at coming back stronger.The Government remains committed to a strategy of elimination, but will always remain open to evolving ways of achieving it.No system is perfect.  That is why we look to continually improve.  As we learn more about the virus and other countries’ experiences, and as new technologies are developed, there will be opportunities to improve our response.  Our response has never been static and we will continue to innovate and learn.The Government will retain and enhance the multiple lines of defence to keep COVID at bay and stamp it out with minimal disruption to the economy and to our everyday lives.The first layer of defence is our border.  With COVID cases increasing around the world, in a growing number of countries, the risk of travelers arriving at the border with COVID increases.  The Government will continue to strengthen border protections.  Testing, infection control procedures, and professional and quality staffing will remain cornerstones of the response.For those countries where the virus is successfully managed, the Government will look for opportunities for freer travel.  Planning for quarantine free travel zones is currently underway with the Cook Islands, Niue and Australia.  We will look to continue to advance these opportunities, but with safety as our priority.  We will continue to welcome New Zealanders home.We will also create opportunities for businesses to access the skills they need.  The Government will ensure that up to 10 percent of places in our managed isolation facilities are used by people granted exceptions to enter New Zealand to contribute to accelerating our recovery.The Government will continue to enhance the next layer of defence, our contact tracing and testing systems, to ensure in the event of cases entering the community it can quickly circle the virus and stamp it out.  This will involve investment in ongoing technical enhancements to the COVID Tracer App and looking for ways to increase the use of technology.We have expanded the surveillance testing programme to provide extra protection against pathways for infection.  This term we will look for opportunities to take advantage of developments in technology to expand the reach of our early warning system.Finally, the Government is working to deliver effective and free vaccines to New Zealanders as soon as they are available and safe to administer.Recent news of the progress in vaccine development is welcome and a bright spot on the horizon.  This will be a central focus for the Government next year.The Government is working hard to secure supply for New Zealand and to design an immunisation programme to support distribution in New Zealand.  New Zealand also has an important role in supporting Pacific countries with access to a COVID-19 vaccine and their rollout of their immunisation programmes.  New Zealand's obligations to the Pacific are a core part of the Vaccine Strategy.We are hopeful that 2021 will be the year of the COVID vaccine. Accelerating the RecoveryThe Government’s COVID recovery plan is already underway.  It will now be accelerated as the plans for recovery set out in Labour’s election manifesto are implemented.The New Zealand economy has held up better than expected.  Aggressive action to eliminate the virus; strong and early efforts to save jobs and support businesses; and innovative and nimble responses from our businesses have positioned the economy well.  But the global picture is bleak.The ongoing impact of COVID on the global economy is the most significant risk to our future growth.  The virus’ spread abroad will have a downstream impact on our exporters and impact economic activity domestically.New Zealand will be cushioned from that slump by the Government’s five point economic plan to foster jobs and growth:$42 billion of infrastructure investment to future proof the economyTraining and job creation opportunities to support workers and businessesSupport for small business to grow and thriveProgrammes to bolster our exportsAnd policies that prepare New Zealand for the future by making the most of our competitive advantage in renewable energy and waste reduction.Investing in infrastructure is at the core of the Government’s economic plan.  As we begin this term, we already have a record $42.2 billion on the books for infrastructure investment over the next four years in roads and rail, schools and hospitals, houses and energy generation.Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency will receive $9.6 billion to invest in new roads and public transport projects that reduce congestion and travel times, support businesses, open up new areas for housing, and increase choice, including safer options for walking and cycling.$3.8 billion is being spent on education facilities, including building new schools and classrooms for 100,000 students and starting the planned upgrade of around 180 schools right across the country over the next 10 years.$3.6 billion has been committed to health, including new hospital facilities in Dunedin, Christchurch, New Plymouth, Auckland and Counties Manukau. Kainga Ora will invest $9.8 billion across the next four years and the Government is on track to deliver a total of 18,000 public and transitional homes.The Three Waters programme will see a $710 million investment to initiate an overhaul of the nation’s drinking, waste and stormwater infrastructure.These investments in housing, transport, schools and hospitals will help future proof our economy as well as create jobs.  It also provides a pipeline of work that will provide businesses with confidence and certainty to invest in capacity to undertake these projects.In addition, over 150 smaller community infrastructure projects will roll out over the coming months and across the term.  The Government will invest in community projects like pools and stadiums, local fire stations and surf clubs, and libraries, art galleries, marae and museums –facilities across the country that bring people together to provide support and strengthen communities.Improving our planning system is also a priority.  It will create jobs by making it easier to deliver construction projects while protecting our environment and building the right thing in the right place.  The current system is too costly, takes too long, and has not adequately protected the environment.  The Government will ensure that New Zealand’s resource management system is fit for the future by repealing and replacing the Resource Management Act.  The Randerson review provides a sound platform for the Government to advance this work.  In the first six months of 2021 the Government intends to release an exposure draft of key elements of the first bill. Also vital to the recovery is our investment in trades training and apprenticeships.  Education is the greatest enabler in our society and one of the biggest levers we can use to improve the productivity of the economy.In the early stages of our COVID response the Government focused heavily on growing training and apprenticeships.  It launched a comprehensive support package for apprentices and their employers, assuring job security for existing apprentices and creating openings for new ones.Already thousands of New Zealanders have embraced the opportunity to take up a trade and train for free.  These New Zealanders are acquiring new skills and exciting prospects, and at the same time addressing the need to build the workforce that will be required to carry the vast workload of the coming infrastructure projects.The Government will also complete the reform of the vocational education system.  As the country rebuilds and more people are looking to retrain, it’s now more important than ever that we have a vocational education system that’s responsive to the needs of industry and learners.The Government recognises the need to welcome skilled people from overseas to support New Zealand’s economy, and will work alongside industry to help provide for that but it will, as a priority and a starting point, seek to develop New Zealand workforces to meet those skills needed here at home.  With many New Zealanders looking for work, we need to do all we can to fill existing job opportunities.While unemployment is lower than expected, the economic fallout has had an impact.  The Government will remain focused on creating opportunities for people to get back into work.History shows that significant economic events have a disproportionate impact on women, Māori and Pacific communities, and our focus will ensure our recovery responds to that.The Government will reinstate the Training Incentive Allowance to assist sole-parents, disabled people and their carers with the costs of getting a degree level tertiary qualification.It will continue the successful Mana in Mahi and He Poutama Rangatahi programmes which are providing skills and qualifications to unemployed young people.  It will also continue to rollout Tupu Aotearoa's expansion across the regions and provide wraparound support for Pacific communities to secure sustainable employment and educational pathways for Pacific peoples of all ages.The government will lift abatement thresholds to ensure that people are not punished by transitioning from a benefit to paid work.  It will also support those at risk of long-term unemployment through funding up to an additional 40,000 New Zealanders into work through the Flexi-wage programme.As well as creating jobs, the Government will remain focused on growing the incomes and wages of New Zealanders, especially those earning the least.It will increase the minimum wage to $20 per hour next year, extend Living Wage guarantees to cleaning, catering and security guards who the public service pays through contractors, implement Fair Pay Agreements to set minimum standards for pay and conditions, and extend sick leave provisions.The Government will leverage our successful COVID response to position New Zealand globally as a safe and secure place to trade with, to invest in, and eventually, to visit again.The Government will pursue high quality and comprehensive trade agreements that diversify our trade relationships.  It will continue to open new opportunities, including through trade deals with the EU and the UK, and the Agreement on Climate Change, Trade, and Sustainability; and by expanding the CPTPP and the Digital Economic Partnership Agreement.The Government will continue to progress our trade relationship with the United States, including into new areas such as digital and green technology.An important milestone has been accomplished with the conclusion of the China FTA Upgrade, which will provide access into new services markets in China, including e-commerce.  The New Zealand Government will continue to support New Zealand exporters doing business with China.The Pacific regional trade and development agreement PACER Plus will enter into force in December this year.  The agreement positions Pacific countries to better engage in international trade.  It will make trade easier, will grow jobs, boost sustainable economic growth and contribute to a safer and more prosperous Pacific.In the Indo-Pacific region, the Government will work to implement the signing of RCEP; and through chairing APEC in 2021, New Zealand will lead on the world stage to drive initiatives for strong regional economic recovery.The Government will work with industry through Industry Transformation Plans to support the transition and grow high-value export firms.  It will continue its investment in innovation, including through the research and development tax credit programme.It will work to implement the primary sector roadmap Fit For a Better World to accelerate the productivity, sustainability and inclusiveness of the primary sector.  It will work to support our tourism sector in its transition to a sustainable, low carbon, high skill and high wage industry.It will expand the Innovative Partnerships programme and New Zealand Trade and Enterprise’s dedicated international investment attraction team to attract companies to invest and establish in New Zealand.Small businesses are at the heart of New Zealand’s economy and the recovery.  The Government will continue to support small businesses with practical support.  That will include tackling barriers to innovation and growth as identified by the Small Business Council’s Small Business Strategy.The Government has already extended the Small Business Cashflow Scheme for a further three years and extended the interest-free period for another year, and will investigate permanent financing for smaller businesses.The Government will regulate Merchant Service Fees to reduce costs on retailers, and will support small businesses to digitise through digital training or short-courses as part of a new Digital Training programme.The new Minister for the Digital Economy and Communications will work with the technology sector, including through the Digital Technologies Industry Transformation Plan, to help speed growth in jobs and incomes in that important sector.New Zealand’s COVID-19 recovery provides an opportunity to reshape our economy and prepare for the future through investment in energy and waste projects.The Government is committed to the shift away from fossil fuels in order to build a new low-carbon future.  It is a shift that will create jobs, improve the environment, and enhance New Zealand’s global brand which our exporters trade on.This term the Government will lay the foundation for the electrification of New Zealand’s economy by bringing forward our 100% renewable electricity target to 2030, prohibit the building of new thermal baseload electricity, investigate dry year storage options such as pumped hydro, and invest in emerging technologies like green hydrogen.It will remove barriers to renewable energy generation through a National Policy Statement and also investigate regulatory or market barriers to the uptake of solar micro-generation on residential and commercial buildings.The Government will invest in electrifying and decarbonising industrial and process heat, including by preventing the installation of new low and medium temperature coal-fired boilers, and supporting businesses to replace fossil fuels in industrial heat processes by connecting to the grid.The Government will implement the recommendations of the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor by phasing out hard to recycle single-use plastic items and supporting the development of alternatives through a Plastics Innovation Fund.  It will also invest in waste infrastructure and projects to enable more efficient recycling, and work with industries to establish regulated product stewardship schemes for priority products.This economic plan is underpinned by continued responsible management of the Government books.  As a consequence of the wider economic outlook and fiscal constraints, it is more important than ever to ensure a balanced approach.  This requires investing in our priorities while ensuring that all Government spending decisions are made with particular consideration for the sustainability of the Crown’s long-term fiscal position.The Government will continue to ensure vital public services are supported, while keeping a lid on debt.  Investments to accelerate the recovery will be prioritised.  Ensuring our health and education systems continue to be supported will also be a priority.This will include implementing the Government response to the Health and Disability System review.  The efforts of many hardworking and committed health professionals and the health of New Zealanders are hampered by a system that needs fundamental reform.  Initial decisions on policy will be taken in 2021. Laying the foundations for a better futureThe Government has marked out the need and importance of taking a broader view of success.  Wellbeing will continue to be a priority for Government this term with a focus on reducing child poverty, tackling climate change, and addressing housing.New Zealand’s response to COVID would be insufficient if it were to simply return us to the way we were before the virus.Recovering and rebuilding entails determined and connected action by government.  That action can, and will, be used to reshape the economy to be more productive, more sustainable, and more equitable.Over the next term it will place a particular focus on sustainability, and pursuing carbon neutrality.The Government will respond to the first set of Climate Budgets recommended by the Climate Commission, which will set the total emissions permitted for the next fifteen years.The Government will take steps to decarbonise the transport fleet.  It will introduce vehicle emissions standards for imported vehicles and incentivise and accelerate the uptake of electric and other low emission vehicles, including by increasing the Low Emissions Vehicles Contestable Fund.In line with the direction set out in the latest Government Policy Statement, it will prioritise investment in public transport, walking and cycling so users have a more accessible, affordable and reliable service, and implement region-specific plans to increase the number of people using public transport and walking and cycling.  Supporting the use of public transport is a key element to reducing New Zealand’s transport emissions.Given the importance of public transport to New Zealand’s future transport system, it will require only zero emissions buses to be purchased by 2025, and aim to decarbonise the public transport bus fleet by 2035.New Zealand’s farmers and growers are creative, innovative and constantly looking to improve their practices.  They are taking steps to improve freshwater quality, protect biodiversity and reduce emissions.  This will create real value for our exports and is a core part of our New Zealand brand.The Government will bolster these efforts through increased investment in world leading research that helps us reduce emissions and will support farmers to use integrated farm plans to simplify processes, reduce compliance costs and meet reporting requirements in a coherent way.The economic impact of COVID will have a disproportionate effect on those least equipped to deal with it.  That will require a continued focus and determination in reducing inequality and addressing child poverty.Progress has been made, but there remains much to do.  The Government will continue the work from last term that has already seen improvements to the weekly income of around 85,000 sole parents by an average of $100 a week.The Government will continue the overhaul of the welfare system, building on the changes already made, including the indexing of benefits to increases in the average wage.It will extend the Free and Healthy Lunch programme to cover 200,000 students and will add 20 more mobile dental clinics to improve access for children and young people to free oral health care.It will roll out mental health support to all primary and intermediate school age students, and continue to roll out nurses in secondary schools.It will continue to tackle the prevalence of rheumatic fever by expanding the Healthy Homes Initiative to every DHB around the country to ensure more homes are warm, dry and safe. A focus on housing will be a priority for this Government.  Earlier in the year house prices were predicted to fall.  Instead they have increased.  Globally, low interest rates are having a similar effect.  And the situation has rapidly evolved.While it is pleasing to see that efforts to stimulate the economy and support jobs and growth in the wider economy have been effective, the perverse impact on housing affordability will require the Government to continue its focus on this issue.The Government has set out the parameters of what it is prepared to consider during the election campaign.  This will not change.  But there is room to do more to support both the supply and demand side of housing to see outcomes that are more productive and fair.The Government will review its housing settings with a view to implementing policies that improve access to the housing market for first home buyers.The Government will continue to focus on homelessness and implementing the Homelessness Action Plan.The Government will review and enhance the Tenancy Tribunal, Tenancy Services’ Compliance and Investigations team, regulate property managers, and increase funding to proactively monitor compliance with the Healthy Homes Standards.In each of these areas, climate, child poverty, and housing, the Government will be guided by its values, and by its commitment to the wellbeing of people, looking beyond GDP to find our measure of success.As part of this focus on wellbeing and creating a fairer New Zealand we will continue to strengthen social inclusion in New Zealand.  This is about supporting our diversity and creating a New Zealand where all people feel safe, have equal access to opportunities and do not experience discrimination.  This is important as we prepare to receive and respond to the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Terrorist Attack on Christchurch Mosques on 15 March 2019.Wellbeing might not be as readily reckoned as GDP, but that does not mean it cannot be measured and tracked.  Imbalances and deprivation can be recognised and remedied and this Government is determined to do so.Significant levels of government investment in a time of crisis can be a powerful tool for change and it’s a tool that is being used.  The way we choose to govern is also a tool for change. Māori-Crown relationsThe Government will strengthen the Māori-Crown relationship to ensure that the Crown can grow to be a better Treaty Partner and work in true partnership with Māori.  It will continue to work to settle historic Treaty of Waitangi claims.  It recognises the importance of te reo Māori as a taonga and the responsibility it has to protect it.Te Ao Māori plays a large part not just in defining who we are as a nation, but in setting us apart from the rest of the world.  As such the Government will make Matariki a public holiday, creating a holiday that distinctly recognises and celebrates Te Ao Māori.The Government will ensure Oranga Tamariki partners with iwi, hapū, and Māori organisations to find appropriate solutions for children in need, and will strengthen Māori housing outcomes through collaborative partnerships, home-ownership models, and papakāinga provision.It will support Whānau Māori enterprise and opportunities through a progressive procurement policy.It will continue to invest in Whānau Ora and support other agencies to implement the Whānau Ora model to get better outcomes for Māori, continue whānau-centred pathways to break the cycle of Māori reoffending, work with other Māori organisations like Te Kōhanga Reo, and look at ways we can expand the Whānau Ora model into communities. A Government for all New Zealanders New Zealand has entrusted the government with the responsibility of bringing the country through a crisis.Nothing in the programme set out today will come easily.  But our opportunities and potential greatly outweigh our problems.In this pandemic we have shown our willingness and capacity to do what must be done.We have more freedoms, are a more open economy and have saved more lives than nearly every other country we normally compare ourselves to.  We can rightfully be proud of our success to date as a nation, as a team.  But we cannot afford to be complacent, nor stand still.  We must keep going.It is the Government’s aim to achieve change alongside consensus.  That is why it has committed to being a Government that will govern for all New Zealanders.That does not mean that it can or will represent the views of every New Zealander all of the time.  But it does mean it will have a focus on the things that matter most.  It means it will be listening to New Zealanders, being pragmatic, doing the things it said it would do and focusing on lasting change.We can recover and we will recover.But that is not enough.  We can be better than we were.This government’s mission is to make it so.Nō reira, tēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, tēnā tātou katoa."
2020-11-23T21:00:00Z,        Rino Tirikatene,  Speech to Wakatū Nelson regional hui on trade,"First, I want to express my thanks to Te Taumata for this hui and for all the fantastic work you are doing for Māori in the trade space. In the short time that you’ve been operating you’ve already contributed an enormous amount to the conversation, and developed impressive networks. I come to my new role in a time of great challenge for exporters.  Against the backdrop of increasing threats to the global trading system and rising protectionism in our key markets, we now also face an uncertain headwind that none of us could have seen coming - COVID-19. Pressures on the international systems we rely on to achieve our trade policy objectives have been exacerbated by COVID-19’s economic impacts and by measures being taken in response to the pandemic. The Government’s priority this year has been to keep the pandemic under control here and to mitigate as far as possible its impact on our people, health system and the economy.  Recognising the immediate impact on exporters caused by the global spread of the pandemic, the Government moved quickly to develop a strategy for trade recovery.  The strategy, launched in June, provides more support for exporters and redirects the efforts of government agencies on practical steps to ensure New Zealand is still internationally ‘connected’ and bolster our resilience to future shocks. NZTE has significantly increased its support and services to exporters to help position New Zealand companies to recover their markets quickly and seek new opportunities. Trade will be a key driver of our economic recovery, and the success of Māori export businesses are an important part of that.  I have been impressed by the way Māori businesses have been adapting to meet the changing demands of the post-COVID marketplace. The opportunities in the food and beverage sector are particularly promising, and companies are responding quickly to changes in key markets and reconfiguring their processing and selling practices and options. These sorts of decisions are ultimately commercial ones for all of you to make. The focus of our Government is on making sure there are as many options as possible available, and getting behind those export decisions on the ground.  Despite the current challenges, our trade agenda has continued without pause.  MFAT has moved negotiations online and rounds have continued throughout the year. The recently signed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will help us build back better and accelerate our economic recovery, including the Maori economy. RCEP is estimated to add $186 billion to the world economy and increase New Zealand’s GDP by around $2 billion. RCEP will consolidate a number of existing free trade agreements New Zealand has with the region into a single rulebook, streamlining documentation requirements and reducing red tape for Māori exporters.  RCEP will also improve market access into Indonesia for products of relevance to Māori export businesses, including through tariff elimination on sheep meat, beef, fish, liquid milk, honey and avocados.We launched FTA negotiations with the UK this year and have already held two rounds of negotiation. The UK is New Zealand’s sixth-largest trading partner, with annual trade of almost NZ$6 billion. Modelling by the UK indicates that the agreement could – in time – lead to an increase in New Zealand’s GDP of up to $970 million, and boost our exports to the UK by 40 per cent.  Negotiations with the EU, New Zealand’s third-largest export market, are also continuing, with another round under way this week. We also hope to sign an upgrade to New Zealand’s FTA with China at a date to be agreed soon. If all New Zealand’s current FTA negotiations are successfully concluded and enter into force they will cover around 76 per cent of our exports of goods and services.  Many of those gains will accrue to Māori, and it will be important that Māori access the preferences created by those agreements to grow our export sectors and diversify our markets. In my new role, I have been asked by the Minister for Trade and Export Growth to work with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Māori Development to ensure the Government's trade policy and trade promotion work are helping Māori exporters to succeed on the world stage.  This mahi is more important now than ever, both for the future of our people, and for the well-being of New Zealand.  I will be continuing the direction set by my colleagues before me who launched the Trade For All agenda to ensure all New Zealanders benefit from our trade success.   Trade for AllTrade for All, at its heart, was an opportunity to update New Zealand’s trade policy to enhance the benefits of trade for all New Zealanders.  As some of you know, and indeed were directly involved with, an independent Trade for All Advisory Board was established in 2018 and reported to Ministers in 2019.  The board’s recommendations cover a wide range of trade-related kaupapa and speak directly to Māori interests in a number of areas.  I hear a lot about how trade can benefit Māori, but I’m heartened to hear, because it speaks to the value of Māori exports, is how Māori trade can benefit New Zealand.  New Zealand has a reputation for excellence in food production, high-quality education, natural beauty and a country that deeply cares about issues like climate change and the well-being of our people. This is all inextricably tied to Te Ao Māori.  It is the unique part of our country’s offering to the world and it has huge economic value for Māori and the rest of New Zealand. The Trade for All Board highlighted the potential for New Zealand to benefit from encouraging and developing greater Māori leadership of our country’s international engagement, economically, culturally and diplomatically.  This opportunity has become more apparent as the pattern of New Zealand’s trade has broadened from its traditional Western partners to a more diverse range of countries.  While the Trade For All Board presented its report prior to the COVID19 crisis, it had the forethought to present trade policy and health as interconnected issues.  In particular, its recommendation 5 states that “…a strong, rights-based approach to health should always be a pillar of New Zealand trade negotiating mandates…”. Cabinet’s decision in March to implement the TFA board’s recommendations cemented this, and it is a theme that runs through the implementation of other recommendations and the Trade Recovery Strategy. Trade for All is fundamental to ensure an economy that is growing and working for all New Zealanders. Alongside New Zealand’s COVID-19 Trade Recovery Strategy, full implementation of Trade for All contributes to an economy that produces and exports higher value goods, one that protects the environment, supports our regions to grow, and one that makes sure all New Zealanders share in the rewards of economic growth through trade.  As Under-Secretary for Trade and Economic Growth, I will be contributing to the Trade for All agenda by supporting Māori success through trade. Aotearoa ki te Ao Last year, former Associate Minister for Trade and Export Growth Nanaia Mahuta established a programme of work designed to support Māori Trade Opportunities: Aotearoa ki te Ao.  Its four strategic pillars, or pou, were designed to ensure trade policy helps Māori succeed internationally.  The Minister has asked me to continue this work to help to position Māori to lead international efforts to expand the participation of indigenous people in global trade, including through the expansion of inclusive trade policies, rules and co-operation with our trade partners. The Australia and Aotearoa-New Zealand Indigenous Collaboration Arrangement signed in February, promotes indigenous peoples’ agency, culture, economy and well-being and provides a structure for trans-Tasman engagement between senior officials, indigenous leaders and Ministers.  It is intended that the arrangement act as a platform for wider engagement, including with Canada. New Zealand is also commencing separate discussions with Canada and Chile on efforts to promote indigenous to indigenous trade through the Inclusive Trade Action Group.In my new role, you can expect me to continue to champion these international indigenous partnerships.These are uncertain times. The global health and economic consequences of COVID-19 will be with us for some time. But New Zealand is well-placed to weather the storm and we expect to emerge from it stronger.  New Zealand’s success so far in protecting lives and livelihoods has put us in a better position than many other countries. s a trading nation we rely on international customers. This Government is committed to working with Māori to further improve their part in New Zealand’s great reputation as a place to trade with and invest in. I am honoured to play a role in that mission. I look forward to supporting your work to lift opportunities for Māori and to continue to grow the voice of tangata whenua in the development of Aotearoa New Zealand’s trade agenda.  Thank you."
2020-11-23T20:15:18Z,        Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern,  Speech to Primary Industries Summit,"Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today about the significant contribution the food and fibres sector makes to New Zealand and how this Government is supporting that effort.I’d like to start by acknowledging our co-Chairs, Terry Copeland and Mavis Mullins, my colleague, Agriculture Minister Damien O’Connor, all of you in the audience, and the impressive line-up of speakers that we have here today. It is great to be here today, talking for the first time since the election.The election delivered the Labour Government a very strong mandate, the first majority government under MMP.  It’s an outcome we’ve been truly humbled by.And it is pleasing that this strong mandate has been delivered equally across the country, including in rural communities like Morrinsville.The success of Labour in rural New Zealand is a huge honour, but with it comes huge responsibility. And also huge opportunities. The vote represents both an endorsement of the direction the Government is heading, as well as a requirement to work more closely with our rural communities and I want to see more of that happening locally. I have made it very clear to our all our MPs, as well as those in provincial seats, that the primary sector is a key partner and stakeholder for this Government, and I want to see ideas permeate up from the grass roots as well as our engagement at a leadership level. I have articulated three key objectives for the Government – continuing to keep New Zealanders safe from Covid, accelerating our economic recovery and laying the foundations for the future. Primary industries are at the heart of each objective. Keeping the virus out means our domestic economy can stay open, accelerating our recovery means leveraging our Covid free brand to maximise our export value while accessing new markets and laying the foundations for the future means tackling long term challenges like our water quality and climate change because it is our economic interests to do so, but also because they are the right things to do for our today and for our future. I have said on a number of occasions that we intend to be a Government for all New Zealanders. I am well aware of the breadth of New Zealanders who placed their trust in the Government and the direction set out. We won’t agree on everything all the time, but we will engage, we will listen and we will represent local interests. So that is where we are now, but I want to reflect on where we’ve been together this year.  In March this year we asked our country to go into lockdown. At that time we had to get COVID-19 under control so that we could enjoy the freedoms we have today.What we knew was how complicated shutting down an economy would be. There are goods and services that if we lost access to, our country would simply cease to function. We needed to ensure that basic services like healthcare, freight and utilities were still available. We needed to keep producing food for tables not just in New Zealand, but all over the world. As you all know, the food and fibres sector was integral to this.I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge the role that our food producing and processing businesses have played over the past nine months. I’d also like to acknowledge the non-food businesses that nevertheless played a key role during the lockdown period – such as processing wool for medical facemasks and producing paper and timber products needed to package and transport food.Whether it was working quickly and cooperatively with government agencies to register as essential services and develop safe working practices, or simply getting up and going to work in what were uncertain and, occasionally, unsettling times, you and your industries kept New Zealand moving.It wasn’t easy, there were challenges and hiccups, but we navigated them all together.Thank you. We wouldn’t be where we are at now were it not for those effortsWhile it hasn’t been an easy period, I know we all appreciate the agility and innovation that has been on show as many primary producers quickly implemented new ways of working.Some industries that rely heavily on seasonal labour, such as the horticulture industry, have struggled due to border closures. However, many parts of industry have taken innovative steps to encourage more New Zealanders into their sectors. This has been a lifeline for many redeployed workers from industries such as tourism and hospitality.Whether it is keeping the milk flowing through our processing plants or livestock moving through our freezing works, the food and fibres sector has kept New Zealanders fed and maintained our vital export markets.Not all food and fibre sectors have been so lucky though. Industries like wool, fisheries and forestry have suffered significant disruptions and had to make great sacrifices. For that I acknowledge you. No one’s journey through Covid has been the same as others.But there has been a common trait. The strength and innovation you’ve demonstrated are exactly the qualities that will put us in good stead as we embark on our recovery.While much of this year has been focussed on responding to COVID-19, we’ve also kept working on some of the long-term issues that New Zealand is dealing with. In September the new national directions on freshwater came into effect. Together these will immediately stop further degradation to our freshwater, and over a generation will lead to improved ecosystem health, in both urban and rural waterways.As we get further into implementation of this package, if some aspects are found to be impractical on the ground, or unclear, Ministers will receive that advice with the view to making the regulations workable. That’s in everyone’s best interest. And I thank everyone who is working with us to achieve what I believed to be a common goal.That’s why we’re also providing financial assistance for the implementation of the new clean water standards through a $700 million fund that will create jobs in riparian and wetland planting, removing sediments and other initiatives to prevent farm run off entering waterways.The direction is ambitious, but we believe it’s achievable. Many in the food and fibres sector are already well on their way and operate at best practice, and most I have met take great pride in taking care of their land, water and animals. We have work to do, but let’s keep talking.I know this isn’t the only area where you have plans for change.When I spoke to you at this event last year, The Minister of Agriculture had commissioned the Primary Sector Council to work across the sector and form a vision for the way forward for primary production in the coming decades.The vision that the Primary Sector Council delivered puts people at the centre. It focuses on rapidly moving to a low carbon emissions society, restoring the health of our water, reversing the decline in biodiversity and, at the same time, producing high-quality, trusted and healthy food, drinks and fibres.COVID-19 has not changed this direction of travel, but it has made this transformation even more pressing than before.It outlines industry-specific and cross-cutting initiatives that together will add $44 billion in exports to the food and fibre sectors over the next ten years.This is an opportunity for us to get alongside industry and invest significantly.To that end, we’ve boosted the Ministry for Primary Industries’ flagship funding programme, the Sustainable Food and Fibre Futures fund, by bringing forward more than $80 million to provide immediate co-investment.In addition to that, there are significant parts of the roadmap that the Government is already backing:improving freshwater quality through riparian planting and supporting farmer catchment groups on-the-ground;reducing agricultural emissions;water storage projects;providing support for exporters;the One Billion Trees scheme, to get the right tree in the right place at the right time;developing new high value horticultural crops;helping build better support tools to provide meaningful data to farmer;fighting pests like wilding pines and wallabies to limit production loss; and:helping the sector train more Kiwis to get jobs on orchards, farms, in pack houses and elsewhere.In Budget 2020 we invested more than $1.1 billion in the Jobs for Nature programme which will improve freshwater, improve biosecurity and enhance biodiversity on public and private land. This programme will provide up to 11,000 jobs and economic support for people and communities across Aotearoa, while ensuring environmental benefits. We also invested $111.2 million through Budget 2020 to provide support for rural and fishing communities, ensure the supply of food to New Zealanders and address animal welfare issues, address market access issues for horticulture, and attract New Zealanders to employment opportunities in the food and fibre sectors.Improving access to markets remains a focus for us. A little over a week ago Hon. Damien O’Connor and I announced the conclusion and signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Once it enters into force, RCEP will be the largest free trade agreement in the world. It will position New Zealand at the centre of economic cooperation initiatives in a region which accounts for 30 per cent of the world’s population, nearly a third of the world’s GDP and destination for 56 per cent of New Zealand’s total exports.  RCEP will increase opportunities for our exporters, cut red tape and offer one set of trade rules across the Asia Pacific region. This will result in around a $2 billion increase to New Zealand’s GDP.Our food and fibres sector will benefit greatly from this deal, particularly from the elimination of tariffs on some meat products into Indonesia. Our next step is to deliver on the EU FTA.I’d also like to acknowledge He Waka Eke Noa which is a world-first partnership between the food and fibres sector, government, and Māori. It will help farmers reduce their on-farm emissions and adapt to climate change while contributing to New Zealand reaching our domestic targets for long-lived gases and biogenic methane.  It’s a work programme I’m absolutely convinced will only enhance our trade opportunities in the long run.The thing that all these initiatives have in common is that they demonstrate how the industry and government are working together to overcome problems and build a renewed food and fibres sector that is fit for a better world. It’s a sector I know we all hope will go from strength to strength including by attracting kiwis to work in the industry.Our Fit for a Better World roadmap identifies the goal of employing 10 per cent more New Zealanders from all walks of life in the food and fibres sector by 2030, and 10,000 more New Zealanders in the food and fibres sector workforce over the next four years.The most important asset that any business has is its people. By helping more people into jobs and providing excellent and safe workplaces, while also upskilling New Zealanders at all stages of their careers, we will build a prosperous future together.Achieving this goal is vital to our success. It will ensure that our businesses can remain operational in the absence of overseas visitors, it will provide meaningful employment to those that have lost their jobs due to COVID-19, it will support our rural communities, and it will build the resilience of our food and fibres sector.Finally, by taking care of our people and our environment while also lifting our sights to growth through value rather than volume, the food and fibres sector will be at the forefront of what will be an export-led recovery.I know that’s a vision you share, and I’m excited for the work I know we can do to deliver on that.Thank you."
2020-11-19T03:32:12Z,        Hon Dr Megan Woods,  Speech to Infrastructure NZ Symposium,"Tena Koutou, Tena Koutou and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today.This is a critical time for New Zealand as we respond to the damage wreaked by the global COVID-19 pandemic.It is vital that investment in our economic recovery is well thought through, and makes the most of the opportunity to build a better future which puts people and sustainability at its heart.   As we observe the worsening pandemic from our relatively comfortable position of stamping out its spread, we remain committed to fending off a resurgence that can threaten our safety, wellbeing and our way of life.It has been a difficult year for many people and businesses and the shadow of COVID affects our actions in ways we could not have predicted this time a last year.It has also turned up some unexpected results; as we came out of lockdown I was acutely aware of a collective fear of a GFCesque housing downturn; but we have seen the opposite.Our economic recovery has been stronger than we anticipated; we are seeing house prices rise further and demand for housing outstrip the rate at which supply is increasing. This has negative impacts on things like homelessness, the public housing waiting list, rental stress and people struggling to buy properties. As Minister of Housing I am acutely aware of how decades of under-investment in infrastructure and the building of affordable homes has led us to where we are today.There is currently a lot of discussion about what levers can be used to address house price rises; today I am going to talk to you about the most significant lever we have – increasing supply.This is reliant on ensuring we can do something about where we put housing, how we build and pay for it.  Today I’ll outline the significant work we have done and where we have significant work to do.There is no quick fix. There is no one change that will make this housing crisis go away in a hurry.It will take years to increase housing supply and affordability to the point where - as this Government believes - every New Zealander has a warm, dry home.Let’s talk about the barriers..The reasons why we are in this position are well known:Decades of failure to invest in infrastructure to service and grow our communitiesa clunky, expensive resource consenting process that favours incumbents and resists intensificationa deficit of investment in the building of public and affordable housingSo what is our strategy?The starting point for housing is where it goes, and enabling projects to go ahead without being bogged down with restrictions that have little to do with environmental values, is critical.We are committed to the repeal and reform of the Resource Management Act to reduce the timeframes and expense of the consenting process and enable more housing developments to get going. This is work Minister Parker is doing.Ensuring we have the workforce and are sufficiently training people to build homes is another key factor.As we assessed what the greatest risks are to the building sector as we anticipated a recession we only had to look at what happened following the GFC to know what we could NOT allow; to let the building of affordable housing to fall down a hole.This would not be in line with our strategic direction.The $350 m Residential Development Response Fund we announced earlier this year was a direct response to this; by giving developers options to finance developments if and when needed. We will have more to say on this soon.But I want to remind you of other aspects of the significant body of work we have done to fix housing and homelessness which we will be building on further; in short our housing strategy.We have laid the groundwork for a substantial change in the financing and planning of infrastructure that enables communities to grow and thrive.In our first term we’ve established Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development to lead the Housing and Urban system work programme and reform. And we’ve also established Kāinga Ora – Homes and Communities as the Government’s public housing landlord and urban development authority.  These agencies are enabling a more cohesive, strategic and joined-up approach to delivering the Government’s vision for housing and urban development in New Zealand.We are building more public housing than there has been in a generation – 5,670 new public housing places, 4,342 new builds - and we’re on track to deliver over 18 thousand public housing and transitional places by 2024.We are working with the building industry on the Construction Sector Accord, to increase productivity and capability, improve resilience and restore confidence. We are investing $3 billion in projects through the ‘shovel ready’ process that will stimulate urban and provincial economies. The completion of nearly 700 KiwiBuild homes and one thousand more under construction has enabled two thousand market homes to be built through Government initiatives.We are supporting people to buy their own affordable homes through first home loans and grants and a progressive home ownership schemeWe launched the Aotearoa / New Zealand homelessness action plan that has enabled the rapid rehousing of rough sleepers when COVID-19 hit, and will support people to get into and stay in, stable accommodation And we are working with Maori to respond to whānau needs and aspirations.And what those changes mean…The most significant levers to accelerate and support more housing are those that fundamentally change the way infrastructure is financed, planned and consented.You heard from the Finance Minister Grant Robertson yesterday about the Infrastructure Funding and Financing Act to enable private sector finance to be used to construct infrastructure for housing and urban development, and keep debt off council's balance sheets.This will help resolve the impasse of local councils being unable to finance the infrastructure our communities need.The Urban Development Act creates a streamlined process to facilitate developments that put the interests of Māori, councils, developers and diverse communities at the heart of developments, and considers housing, transport and recreational needs.The National Policy Statement – Urban Development requires councils to reduce planning constraints and plan for growth, allowing for greater intensification.Fast tracking of projects that can boost employment and economic recovery will be enabled through the Covid-19 fast-track recovery legislation.These substantial law changes will change the way we plan and pay for infrastructure growth. We encourage industry, local councils, iwi and communities to consider how to use them to deliver developments that prioritise the well-being of people, address climate change and provide services and amenities for generations to come.I am especially proud of our record on public housing – this year we committed funding to build another 8,000 public and transitional homes, which will bring the total to 18,350 by 2024.These developments led by the Government agency Kāinga Ora encourage other developments through significant infrastructure improvements.Kāinga Ora has planned spending of $9.8 billion over the next four years.Its seven Large Scale Projects are changing the infrastructure and housing landscape, and will result in approximately 40,000 homes being built over the next 10-15 years.Kāinga Ora’s use of Off Site Manufacturing is allowing both speed and more volume to be built into developments, with approximately 12% of houses being built in this way.This is demonstrating the value of OSM technology to the sector and what is possible to upscale production and build scale.Kāinga Ora is also demonstrating leadership in the building sector on lowering emissions and reducing waste with a commitment to 6 Homestar standards for new builds.It is this kind of approach that allows us to build back better; investment that reduces our impact on the environment and helps deliver a low-carbon future.Our work with councils to assess barriers and opportunities for housing developments in high need areas through the Ministry of Housing and Development’s place-based programme is identifying what kind of momentum we can achieve and the next steps on a regional basis. Infrastructure to increase housing supply…A lack of investment over many decades in critical areas like transport, and crucial three waters infrastructure has been a vexing problem.Central and Local Government share responsibility for providing the significant investment required to fix failing or aging infrastructure, and to provide new infrastructure for expected population growth, to meet environmental standards, and address climate change.Strong investment in infrastructure is needed to address the current deficit, support growth and to improve wellbeing of New ZealandersThis Government has shown an enormous commitment to infrastructure spending, with a commitment of 42.2 billion over the next four years, on top of $25.1 billion already invested over the past three years. This includes the $3 billion COVID Recovery and Response Fund, the $6.8 billion New Zealand Upgrade programme on transport and over $750 million on three waters infrastructure.  Any central government spending on infrastructure must deliver on multiple fronts; the project must be enduring and future-focussed, it must create jobs and it must represent good value for money.What we’re focused on now…We have a lot of good work to build on, but there is more to do.Implementing the existing urban development initiatives, and reform of the RMA to reduce costs and complexity while supporting environmental outcomes will make a big difference to how our urban areas perform in the future.Minister Mahuta has outlined to the Symposium the three waters reform programme that will be crucial to ensuring we have system-wide enduring solutions to the quality of our water, security, management and delivery.We are continuing to work with our partners in the Construction Sector Accord to maintain momentum in the construction pipeline and forge new ways forward to meet environmental and climate change goals. We will also be undertaking work with the residential construction sector and investors to better understand the appetite for Build to Rent projects which can provide a positive investment option that also grows supply and provides people with much needed housing.While the construction pipeline for residential properties is currently strong, we are well prepared to support future developments with the impact of Covid-19 through our $350 million Residential Development Response Fund. We will be releasing an updated Public Housing Plan in the coming months. This will provide not only more much needed public housing but the certainty of a secure pipeline of work.Directing Kāinga Ora and Community Housing Providers to build in specific locations will better support those in urgent need of housing.The Government will continue working with Community Housing Providers who can add value by building new properties, deliver social services or operate in areas where the Government is not. We will investigate ways to address high building and construction costs with the proposed Commerce Commission market study into building supplies late next year, and working with MBIE to explore further ways to reduce building and construction costsWe will also address remaining legislative barriers that add unnecessary costs, risks and delays to development, with a particular focus on land use constraints, such as restrictive covenants.I also want to look at ways we can innovatively use the accommodation supplement to drive investment.To summarise..As I’ve already noted, addressing the key barriers to urban development is not a quick fix, and it is costly.While we have laid the groundwork for changes, the biggest results will emerge in the medium to longer term.As we recover from the initial impact of COVID-19 we are yet to see its longer term implications.We need to keep up the momentum on the settings we have shifted and do further work with local councils, communities, developers and iwi to accelerate the building of new, affordable housing.  The housing shortage is a critical issue for New Zealand and remains a key priority for this Government to fix.We are committed to using all available levers to get more housing built and I look forward to working with the infrastructure and construction sectors to make that happen."
2020-11-19T02:52:46Z,        Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern,  Pike River 10 Year Anniversary Commemorative Service,"Tēnei te mihi ki a tātau katoa e huihui nei i tēnei rāKi a koutou ngā whānau o te hunga kua riro i kōnei – he mihi aroha ki a koutouKi te hapori whānui – tēnā koutouKi ngā tāngata whenua – tēnā koutouKi ngā mate, e kore koutou e warewaretiaHaere, haere, moe mai rā My warmest greetings to everyone here today My greetings to those who are joining us from and the country and around the world on the live stream. Greetings especially to those who are on the Coast at the portal at Pike River, to you, your loved ones, your family and your friends. Greetings to you all.10 years ago today 31 men went to work at the Pike River Mine.29 of those men never came home.There is nothing relative about grief, sudden loss is devastating. But 10 years ago New Zealand saw a disaster and the grief that followed that was so gut wrenching, and so raw, it was almost unimaginable.  That loss alone would have been too much for most to bear. But for the families of the 29, it was only the beginning. You were left to pick up the pieces. To raise children. To fill a void. But more than that, you were left to fight for, and then carry the burden of knowledge, that what happened at Pike River should not have happened. The Royal Commission of Inquiry into the tragedy found that in the drive towards coal production the directors and executive managers paid insufficient attention to health and safety and exposed the workers to unacceptable risks. It found the Board of Directors did not ensure that health and safety was being properly managed and the Executive Managers did not properly assess the health and safety risks the workers were facing. It found that the mining should have stopped. Today I want to acknowledge your men. Sons, brothers, fathers, husbands, uncles. I want to acknowledge who they were, and the lives they lived.  But I also want to acknowledge you, the Pike River Families. We are here because of your determined efforts to ensure that everything that could be done in honour of your men would be done.You are the ones who said never again. There have been so many, who have worked so hard for so long, but I do want to dwell on the Stand With Pike Families reference group:Anna OsborneSonya RockhouseRowdy DurbridgeYou have never given up your quest for justice, and in part that is down to who you are as people. Tough, kind, stubborn. And honest. A few weeks ago Sonya even messaged me after seeing me on the news to tell me to eat a pie.Thank you. You started as Pike family representatives – I now consider you friends. I also want to take a moment to remember Simon Meikle, who was untiring in giving the Pike families legal advice, and who sadly passed away earlier this month after a battle with cancer.And of course no anniversary of Pike River would be complete without acknowledgment of Helen Kelly and the role she played in holding the company and its leadership to account. Helen passed away before I became leader of the Labour Party, but I know she would have been quick to ensure that we signed up to the Pike River Political Commitment. And we did. It’s a pledge that Andrew Little has worked tirelessly to fulfil. It was a simple pledge - to do all we could to safely recover the Pike River Mine drift and collect evidence, in the hope that there might never be another Pike River disaster again.In our first 100 days we established the Pike River Recovery Agency. The Agency’s mission is clear:To safely re-enter and recover the Pike River Mine drift;To give the Pike River families closure;To promote accountability for the tragedy and to help prevent future mining tragedies. On 15 September this year, in advance of today’s anniversary, Agency staff reached the Pit Bottom in Stone area which is critical for forensic examination.10 years later we are very close to fulfilling the commitment to you.But our obligation to you as families does not just exist at Pike River. It exists in every workplace across the country. I know that is one of the reasons we were asked to be here, in Wellington today. To remind us that the memory of your men, and your decade of efforts, must be carried in all we do to prevent further tragedy. For the past decade you have held Governments both blue and red to account. You have brought about legislative change already, you have reminded us there is more to do. But now is the time for us, all of us, to take up that mantle too. You have carried too much, walked too far, pushed so hard. And you have done it for 10 years. For the next 10 years, let us be the ones to carry that burden. But for today, New Zealand stands with you, embraces you, wishes you rest, and finally, wishes you peace. "
2020-11-19T00:43:32Z,        Hon David Parker,  Keynote address to Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand conference,"Speech to the CAANZ conference - November 19, 2020Thank you, Greg, (Greg Haddon, MC) for the welcome.I’d like to acknowledge John Cuthbertson from CAANZ, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Naomi Ferguson, former fellow MP and former Minister of Revenue, Peter Dunne, other guest speakers and CAANZ members.I am genuinely pleased to be here today. I have had an interest in tax since studying law and commerce at Otago University where I did elective papers in tax in both my law degree and my accounting degree. While I have much to learn, I understand the principles which are supposed to underlie a fair and efficient tax system. Over the years I have experience in tax as a payer, an advisor and a legislator.Through my interests in small business I did GST returns and PAYE returns for many entities for many years. I have stood in queues to pay stamp duty and know what curtilage is. I gave the early legal advice and was early counsel in CIR v Newman; the case which determined the bounds of what scale of subdivisional activity is a business undertaking for GST purposes.I have been a director or CEO of more than a dozen companies in a wide variety of industries. Throughout my legal, business and political careers tax rules have been relevant - to all of them. I recognise the hugely important role taxation has in sending investment signals to business and the fundamental importance of tax policy on social equity.I have seen the improvement computerisation has brought to tax administration, vastly reducing compliance costs.All of these factors, and my personal interest, is why I specifically asked the Prime Minister for the Revenue portfolio.I look forward to engaging with you on important tax issues over the next three years.I would like to acknowledge my predecessor Stuart Nash for his work over the past three years and the work of Finance Minister Grant Robertson, in particular how they leveraged the tax system to aid in our response to COVID-19.I am also looking forward to working with Dr Deborah Russell who has been appointed Revenue Undersecretary. Her extensive tax background, including co-authoring a book about New Zealand’s tax system, will also be helpful over the next three years.Adapting to change - the theme of this year’s conference - seems apt, given the amount of change COVID-19 has forced on our lives in 2020. Lockdowns, closed borders and the need to wear masks was not how we envisioned our lives at New Year’s as we headed into this new decade.Response to the PandemicDespite the challenges, New Zealand’s response to the global pandemic has been world leading. The very fact that we can gather in person here today, at this conference, is a testament to how well we have responded.We were the first country to go into a strict lockdown relative to first Covid death. Our lockdown covered the whole country and was the strictest in the OECD. It had strict rules to ensure isolation broke the chain of Covid that was already rapidly escalating in various parts of New Zealand. Had we not broken the chain of transmission, the exponential growth seen overseas would have occurred here. Back then we could not properly track and trace for a number of reasons, including the then worldwide shortage of test kits and PCR test reagents.We were one of the first, and I would say the quickest, to roll out support to those impacted by the pandemic. We cushioned the blow because it was the right thing to do to maintain the social contract needed to overcome the virus. We increased main benefits by $25 per week for the same reason. The wage subsidy is a key support measures aimed at keeping workers attached to their workplaces. It is a simple scheme. We got the money out the door and into people’s wallets very quickly thanks to swift decisions by Cabinet and the impressive efforts of MSD and IRD. I thank them both. Teams of people working day and night throughout the country helped maintain that essential social cohesion in our team of five million.At its peak, two thirds of the labour force was supported by the subsidy. In total 1.6 million people received it.Inland Revenue and the tax system also played an important role through measures like the Small Business Cashflow (Loan) scheme, the loss carry back scheme, and remitting use of money interest (UOMI), to name but a few. Due to our collective response to Covid we were able to protect the long- term health of our people and achieve the open economy we now enjoy. We chose to forgo some freedoms short term for our collective good. Our choices have served us well so far. While we are still on a perilous journey in this ongoing crisis, there are encouraging signs that reinforce the choices we’ve made. The unemployment rate earlier this month was 5.3%, well below the range of early projections (some of which were dire), much less than the 9% prediction we faced in the Budget, and well below the OECD average of 7.4%. We’ve also seen expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors in September. Consumer and business confidence both improved in October.Voluntary complianceHigh levels of voluntary compliance are key to the success of taxation, and have been especially important in the fight against COVID-19.An important building block of the social cohesion that allowed us to so successfully battle the pandemic was our willingness as “a team of five million” to follow guidelines such as on social distancing, “stay in your bubble”, hand washing and mask wearing. The social theory which lay behind our Covid response had many layers. Communication had to be honest and clear both as to risks of calamity and the behaviour required to avoid that outcome. To work we knew the vast majority of people had to comply voluntarily.That volunteerism both drew upon our high levels of trust and social cohesion and then in turn built even deeper social cohesion in New Zealand. New Zealanders are rightly proud of their society, and the contrast with other countries makes ours look pretty good.Whilst voluntary compliance is key, that in turn relies on people knowing there is a legal back stop – that there are sanctions on those who do not follow the actions needed and threaten the efforts of all. Interestingly, the tax system works in much the same way. We rely on the majority of people to pay the right amount of tax, which is buttressed with clear rules and enforcement powers to be used on those individuals who do not do the right thing.Like our response to the pandemic, this approach works because our tax system is in most respects fair and coherent. People by and large understand that paying taxes is for the greater good – that is to fund important public services they want for themselves, their families and others.A tax system that is fair and coherent - and is complied with - is essential to this country’s continued stability and prosperity. As the new Minister of Revenue, these are features of our tax system that I want to maintain and strive for.The Government’s priorities over the short-term On Covid, while it’s important to recognise our achievements to date, we are still not out of the woods, and New Zealand is not spared the ongoing effects of this global pandemic.This is why the first item of business for Cabinet was making improvements to the Small Business Cashflow loan scheme to provide ongoing support as we rebuild from COVID-19. The small business sector makes up 97% of all enterprises and approximately 29% of all employees, and we want to play a greater role in countering instability through access to capital. Close to 100,000 businesses have received the loan, with total lending of $1.6 billion. Feedback from businesses has been extremely positive and we have been told the support was provided at a time when it was most needed.The scheme has been a success. That’s why we have:extended it for three years,increased the interest free period from one year to two years, andbroadened what loans can be used for, such as capital items.These changes fulfil our pre-election commitments, benefit existing borrowers, and make the scheme more attractive to prospective borrowers.These changes are estimated to result in additional lending of $133 million to small businesses.I have asked officials to provide further advice, before the end of the year, on changes to the scheme that will allow more businesses to benefit from it, such as adjusting the eligibility criteria for the loan. Inland Revenue, MBIE and Treasury will also provide advice on wider issues such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme, the Business Finance Guarantee Scheme, and various business capability building initiatives next year. We are also looking at new ways to support small businesses with finance, such as the proposed Small Business Growth Fund which establishes a micro-finance company for small businesses.The second priority is to get the flexi-wage scheme up and running by the end of the year. It’s essentially a wage subsidy programme that assists employers to hire and helps people with training or mentoring to gain the skills for a job.  The Government wants to support small businesses to adapt to COVID-19, to innovate, support jobs and ensure they keep going in any tough times to come. The Government will also progress the promised new top personal tax rate of 39 per cent on income above $180,000. This change will affect 2 per cent of earners.The extra revenue raised will help fund health and education services, control debt, and support the recovery plan.This new top personal rate will apply from 1 April 2021.We hope to legislate for it before the end of the year so Inland Revenue, payroll software providers and financial institutions will have enough time to adjust their systems and processes. The new 39 per cent rate will need to be supported with integrity measures to address issues like people sheltering income in trusts to avoid the top tax rate.I’m receiving advice from officials on the necessary integrity measures.Improving our tax system - multinationalsPrior to the election, Finance Minister Grant Robertson announced the Government’s intention to address the tax rules that apply to multinationals. The current international tax framework, which was first agreed to in the 1920s, has not kept up with globalisation and in particular the digitalisation of the economy. That is why there’s been significant international concern over the under-taxation of digital multinationals. In part, this is caused by the legal fiction that enables contracts to provide paid services in New Zealand to NZ businesses, who are in turn selling goods and services to NZ customers, to be categorised as not being a transaction in NZ. This is a legal fiction that is divorced from modern reality and needs to be fixed.The result is that digital firms can do business in a country without being subject to tax there. Local New Zealand companies deserve a level-playing field when doing business. We don’t want to force NZ competitors into dodgier tax minimisation strategies to compete. We don’t want NZ media companies to collapse or be undermined in their ability to provide trusted news, sorting fact from fiction aka fake news, and avoid baseless conspiracy theories that wind up ill-informed citizens and undermine civil society, social cohesion and in the longer term prejudice the rights of those who rely on stability.COVID-19 has further exacerbated this issue with digital multinationals playing an ever-increasing role in the economy. It’s a serious issue for countries to grapple with. There are essentially two options for addressing this issue. The first is an OECD-led multilateral solution and the second is for countries to adopt their own digital services taxes (DSTs). Our preference continues to be an OECD-led multilateral solution rather than a proliferation of DSTs. However, success at the OECD is not guaranteed and has been blocked for some time. We are seriously considering implementing a DST in the event the OECD project fails to reach agreement within a reasonable timeframe. The proposed OECD-led solution is split into two “pillars”. Pillar One reallocates more taxing rights to market countries like New Zealand and Pillar Two is aimed at stopping the “race to the bottom” by imposing a global minimum tax. We do have some concerns with the OECD policy, particularly around its complexity and potential compliance costs.  We are working with the OECD to address these.  Despite this, the current policy design does broadly fit with New Zealand’s interests and we support its prompt development.The OECD now plans to deliver a multilateral solution by mid-2021, after its original deadline was delayed partly by COVID-19 but mainly by disagreements between countries.We hope this revised timeline will be met, but it is by no means certain and will require countries to accept greater compromise than has been seen so far.   The Work Programme As the new Minister of Revenue, I have also inherited a Tax Policy Work Programme that I am keen to progress.This includes two bills in the pipeline:Firstly, the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020-21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Bill is an omnibus bill that will set the annual rates of income tax for the 2020-21 tax year. It also has proposals aimed at improving the GST regime, KiwiSaver, Unclaimed Monies and social policy rules administered by Inland Revenue.Secondly, the Child Support Amendment Bill amends the Child Support Act by simplifying penalty rules, introducing payment of financial support by compulsory deduction, imposing a time bar of four years, and inserting a definition of income.I hope to progress these bills through their final stages in the first quarter of next year.There are also a number of projects that officials have been consulting on and that you may have been involved in, such as:the tax treatment of donated trading stock, partly a Covid issueloss continuity, anda permanent loss carry back scheme.Officials are advising me on these projects and I am interested to hear the feedback. Last but not least, the final stage of IR’s business transformation programme is nearing completion. This will launch in March 2021 and deliver improvements to paid parental leave, child support, unclaimed monies, duties and foreign trusts activity.IRs Business Transformation Programme has been very successful.IR and CAANZ roles in the tax systemBefore I finish, I want to touch briefly on Inland Revenue’s role, which I’m sure the Commissioner will talk more about in her speech to the conference tomorrow.IR’s fundamental role remains the same – to make sure people receive and pay the right amounts and that everyone pays their fair share. And that means helping people get things right from the start, as well as reducing the opportunities for non-compliance.Inland Revenue showed its ability to be agile during COVID-19 in the speed with which it set up the Small Businesses Cashflow (Loan) Scheme which quickly had money moving out the door to small businesses.IR also supported your clients with instalment arrangements, remission of penalties and interest.CAANZ and its members will continue to play a role in the pandemic response by providing advice to your clients. Government, IR and CAANZ all need to work together and tailor a response for businesses which are operating in a different environment than they’d planned for.I’m confident that we will continue to work in a positive and constructive way.One of the key assumptions in Inland Revenue’s multi-year business transformation programme was that IR would increasingly work with others to design and deliver services and this will continue.Over the next twelve to eighteen months we’ll need a strong tax and social policy system to help support recovery. 2020 has been a big year and 2021 will be as well. More changes are coming and it’s by working together that we’ll make them successful.Let’s all crack on with it so that our people can live long and prosper even in the midst of a global pandemic.ENDS"
2020-11-17T20:37:59Z,        Rt Hon Jacinda Ardern,  ReBuilding Nations Symposium 2020 (Infrastructure NZ Conference opening session),"Tena koutou katoa and thank you for the opportunity to be with you today.Can I acknowledge Ngarimu Blair, Ngati Whatua, and Mayor Phil Goff for the welcome. Before I start with my substantive comments, I do want to acknowledge the hard work it has taken by everyone to ensure that we can meet together today. Before 2020, we would have called this a conference. Now we call it a mass gathering, and we are amongst only a few countries in the world that is actually having them. I don’t take that for granted, and I know none of you do either. But that is not to say that our path here has been simple, or that the job is done. COVID will be with us for some time to come. We will need to be vigilant for some time to come.  But despite that, we cannot afford to wait for things to get easier before we start our recovery. Our response, and our rebuild need to happen at the same time. And that is exactly what we are doing. In fact, the road to recovery will need to take place at the same time as our ongoing response. That’s why we have already laid out our plan, and we’re now getting on with it. It’s a plan that has five elements. Many of you will have heard me repeat them over the last few months – elections do tend to turn politicians into broken records. It includes:Investing in our peopleJob creationSupporting our small businessesBacking our exportersPreparing and investing in our futureUnder each of these headings lies specific policies and programmes. Things like the wage subsidy which ensured 1.7 million New Zealanders were supported to stay in their jobs. The small business loan scheme which I note has a high uptake from businesses in the construction industry, and is designed to support smaller operators through this period of uncertainty, and our free trades training and apprenticeship support programme, which is seeing a significant lift in those moving into vocational education. The early signs are that our plan is making a difference. In a world where there is no cost free response to COVID 19, we are certainly minimising some of the impacts as best we can. For example, as you will have heard during recent weeks, unemployment at 5.3% is well below the more than 9% prediction we faced at the budget, and puts us below Australia at 6.9% and the OECD average of 7.4%. There are other green shoots of recovery. Merchandise exports since 1 February were higher than in 2019, we saw expansion in the manufacturing and services sectors in September and consumer and business confidence are holding up.But, there is much more to do. Especially on the last area of the plan that I mentioned – preparing and investing in our future. I don’t need to tell you all that any recovery plan for New Zealand cannot, and should not, be a return to the status quo. Because when it comes to the status quo and infrastructure, we have long struggled. The World Economic Forum found in 2019 that New Zealand ranked first out of 141 economies for macroeconomic stability, third for the quality of our institutions and fifth for our labour market - but 46th for the state of our infrastructure.And while estimates vary, prior to Covid-19 our infrastructure deficit has been estimated to be between $25.9 and $75 billion. That’s equivalent to the cost of up to 17 Auckland City Rail Link projects.Those numbers don’t tell the full story though. They’re not just numbers that make for an interesting report. They are having an impact on people’s daily lives. Whether it’s the 30,000 houses Infometrics thinks that Auckland is short of, the lack of adequate access to safe drinking water, or significant congestion issues that contribute to poor productivity. The impact on our day to day lives is clear. And that’s why our recovery plan cannot and is not about a return to the status quo. It is about taking a crisis and turning it into a once in a life time opportunity to build back better. To address decades of under investment. To build the infrastructure the next generation needs and deserves. And to do it together – with local government, the private sector and with iwi.But first, we need to have a very honest assessment of what has led us to where we are today. That assessment will not provide us with one simple silver bullet that if we unleash will resolve all the problems successive governments have faced. I can assure you, politicians are virtual magnets when it comes to silver bullets – if there was one, we would have found it by now. First, as a nation we haven’t been ones for long term planning. It’s probably cruel to recall that we were the city that built a harbour bridge and less than 10 years later had to clip on some extra capacity. Local Government would also probably argue that our regulatory environment creates a disincentive to pursue large scale or ambitious projects, and that’s before you factor in the funding constraints of an ever decreasing rating base in some of the areas where there are critical infrastructure needs. We then have the skills deficit, a procurement environment that has led in some cases to a race to the bottom, challenges with the RMA, and the need for a pipeline of work to maintain capacity in the construction industry. Add that altogether and you can start to see why we have struggled. But you can also see the solutions. This list of challenges is why we created the Infrastructure Commission, to provide the long-term planning that we hope overcomes the short political cycles.  It’s why we worked collaboratively on the Construction Sector Accord to overcome some of the issues around procurement.It’s why we have moved to a multi-year capital allowance to make sure we are moving past an annual Budget process for larger scale and longer term investment plans for areas like health and education. It’s why we have supported local government to have greater flexibility in the way they fund the cost of infrastructure over the lifetime of an asset.  It’s why we have embarked on a massive piece of work to reform our resource management legislation. It’s why we have tried to move beyond the boom and bust cycles for residential building through government backed underwrites. And critically, it’s why we have worked so hard to support skills and trade training, with incentives that support employers to keep on apprentices, and wage subsidies to help take them on too. We will all be amongst the first to admit that in some of these areas, it’s early days. The work needs to bed in, and in some cases, the work will be ongoing. My hope is that you’ll see from the list an absolute awareness from us of the issues you have been raising directly, and a commitment to resolve them. In the meantime, we know an ongoing programme of work will also drive change, and there is no shortage of that. In the last term, we set out an unprecedented infrastructure programme. Even before COVID we were determined to address that long-term under investment in infrastructure, and to drive outcomes that yes were about jobs, but were also about greater public transport options, rebuilding public services, and generally contributing to our decarbonisation goals. In February, approximately a lifetime ago, we announced the New Zealand Upgrade Programme (NZUP) and that we are investing $6.8 billion in transport projects to get our cities moving and boost productivity in the country’s growth areas. The programme will play a vital role in helping to stimulate the economy, providing a pipeline of work for the construction industry and professional services sector for the next decade. But it will also support a shift to greater transport choice – with a balanced investment in public transport, roads and walking and cycling. Add to that the Auckland Transport Alignment Project, Let’s Get Wellington Moving and the increase in the National Land Transport Programme. Then there’s the Education Growth and Redevelopment Programmes – Minister Hipkins will be sharing more information about this tomorrow so I don’t want to steal his thunder but I don’t think he’ll mind if I share that it’s a large and tangible demonstration of this Government’s commitment to provide new and upgraded classrooms that will obviously benefit students but also provide much needed construction industry jobs. The Health Capital Programme – estimated to be $3.9 billion across the next four years will see major projects like Dunedin Hospital – the biggest hospital build in the country. The New Zealand Defence Force has a $4.5 billion dollar capital programme.In the housing sector we are working to address both under supply, and inequality, and have committed to 18,000 additional public and transitional houses by 2024.And for local government, we have a $760 million investment in three waters to help councils upgrade water services across New ZealandNot all of our investment is large scale – we have been mindful of spreading opportunities across the country. The COVID response programme also included investment in community infrastructure such as the Blenheim Library/Art Gallery, Kaikōura Aquatic Centre, and the Auckland City Mission’s New Ground building which will provide detox beds and housing from some of our most vulnerable kiwis.  All of this is before you even consider the areas where we are embarking on business cases, such as the NZ Battery Project. The NZ Battery study we have funded is looking into how we can store renewable energy for those dry hydrological years, and beyond that, how we can get our electricity grid to 100% renewable energy.Investigation of pumped hydro was a key recommendation of the Interim Climate Committee to help us meet our climate change goals. Additionally it will create much-needed jobs.All up, this amounts to a plan for infrastructure that demonstrates just how central it is to our rebuild, to our recovery, to building back better.  We have a huge opportunity –– and I know you in the room here today are just as committed as we are to working together, to not just surviving through this period, but to finding a way to thrive and leave a legacy for our country for our children and grandchildren. So let’s get on with it."
2020-11-16T21:47:03Z,        Hon Stuart Nash,  Tourism Industry Aotearoa Conference,"speech to Tourism Industry Aotearoa annual summitTe Papa,  WellingtonIntroduction Nau mai, haere maiTēnā koutou, tēnā koutou, Ka nui te mihi, ki a koutou. Thank you Tourism Industry Aotearoa for hosting today’s Summit. In particular, my acknowledgements to TIA Chair Gráinne Troute and Chief Executive Chris Roberts. You have been proactive and adaptable in organising this Summit despite the uncertainties of COVID-19, and there is a high quality line-up of expert speakers today.  It is my greatest pleasure to be able to speak to you today in my new role as not only the Minister of Tourism, but also as Minister for Small Business, and Minister for Economic Development and Regional Economic Development.The synergies that exist between these three portfolios are significantThey will enable me to work with the tourism sector within the context of the broader national and regional economy.About meIn the last term of Government, I was the Minister of Small Business, Police, Revenue and Fisheries.As the Minister of Small Business and in fact all businesses, I championed support for small businesses in the face of COVID-19.This included tax refunds through the loss carry-back scheme, the Small Business Loan Scheme, advice through the Regional Business Partners Network, and digital capability funding for tourism businesses.Prior to being a Minister and Member of Parliament, I’ve worked in small and large organisations in both the private and public sectors. This included a six month stint working for Dr Gerry McSweeney at Lake Moeraki Wilderness Lodge as a nature guide. It was an amazing experience in a truly beautiful part of New Zealand.The enduring lesson was the absolute importance of having a strong customer focus and delivering on the brand promises we make to our guests. My four prioritiesSo that brings me to this new term of government.We currently have one of the most open economies in the world.The fact we are gathered here today, side by side, as COVID sweeps through the US and Europe with hundreds of thousands of new cases every day, is testament to the fact that we all followed the rules.On behalf of the Government, I thank you for that.But I do not under-estimate the challenge ahead as the global pandemic reinforces the need for a strong border policy. The Prime Minister has been clear that we will open up travel bubbles only when it is safe to do so.The Government has two over-arching priorities: keeping the country safe from COVID, which relies on strong management of our border, and accelerating the economic recovery to support jobs and businesses.The theme for the Summit today is ‘Revive and Revitalise.’ This reflects the message I have heard from Tourism industry leaders.I know the vast majority of you have done it tough.During the initial COVID19 outbreak the emphasis was on the immediate response. It required quick decisions from government and business.Now we are all in a position to plan the recovery and rebuild over the short, medium and longer term. This is my first speech as Tourism Minister and I want to share my outlook with you. There are four key themes that I will be focusing on as we undertake this recovery and rebuild together.I would be interested in hearing feedback over the next weeks and months as I get around the rest of the country and talk to more Tourism operators and the sector in person.Firstly: ‘Brand New Zealand’ is paramount.  We need to be very clear what our global value proposition is and then deliver on it.Secondly: the Tourism industry will not return to ‘business as usual’, or the world that existed pre-COVID. There is no going back to Tourism circa 2019.Thirdly: It is essential that the full cost of tourism is priced into the visitor experience. To the question of ‘who pays’ the answer is not ‘ratepayers and taxpayers in small New Zealand communities’Finally: Partnership between the government and the industry is critical to achieve this transition. Brand New Zealand‘Brand New Zealand’ is paramount.  There is a risk that we let our brand languish in these troubled times, and there are very few things more difficult than resuscitating a brand in a crowded market. Tourism NZ understands this and is working incredibly hard to mitigate the risk of this happening.To do this and mitigate risk we very clearly need to understand our global value proposition then communicate this to key target demographics in a way that engages and leads to action.We then must live the brand and deliver our brand promises We need to ensure everything we do enhances the experience of those who will be our biggest disciples – or our worst critics. If we fail to deliver we will undermine the considerable opportunities that will exist. If however we get it right, then the world is our oyster. And we must continue to get it right. Our strong response to COVID-19 has boosted New Zealand’s international reputation. Our Prime Minister is a global superstar so let’s leverage off this as much as we possibly can.Over time, as we safely relax border restrictions, we will have an opportunity to capitalise on this. In fact, my ambition is that once global borders open, New Zealand is considered by the world’s most discerning travellers as one of the top three places in the world to visit. Yes this is aspirational, but not impossible.Our brand has never been as strong as it is now, so let’s not waste this opportunity for an industry reset. No going back: the need for long-term sustainabilityTourism in New Zealand will never return to how it was before COVID-19 dramatically affected us.New Zealanders expect a tourism sector that supports their communities and businesses. We must attract high value and high spending visitors who buy into our own vision of sustainability.We must therefore deliver high quality visitor experiences and exceed our visitors’ expectations. No longer will New Zealand communities tolerate the worst of our freedom camping visitors, and nor should they. Some, but not all, have abused our renowned hospitality.I firmly believe that the low-spending but high-cost tourist is not the future of our tourism industry.The sector is under pressure. We have known this for a long time. Problems like:Congestion in our national parks, degradation of our prime natural attractions, creaking local infrastructure, seasonal peaks and troughs  all contribute to a poor visitor experience and an unfair burden on smaller communities.Let’s turn the challenge that COVID-19 has created to an opportunity to reset tourism in New Zealand. There are three things that must happen to achieve this change:We need to have better infrastructureWe need to very clearly understand our markets, and then within these markets we need to target key demographics: particularly high spending visitors. But with this high-end tourist, comes high expectations. The question of ‘who pays’New Zealanders should not be subsidising international visitors to the extent that we have done in the recent past.Some of the costs - such as the impact on infrastructure and the environment – are currently shouldered by taxpayers and ratepayers, when they don’t need to be. I have asked officials for innovative solutions to minimise the costs to New Zealanders of tourism.This includes ensuring visitors pay for the privilege of participating in the New Zealand experience.  I am keen to hear your feedback and ideas for how we can accomplish this. TIA’s Election 2020 Action Plan identifies a shared opportunity to make bold changes to fix longstanding systemic issues that have compromised our desire to build a truly sustainable tourism future. PartnershipPartnership is essential to achieve this transition. Government has resources, and the power to change legislative and regulatory settings, and a fantastic team of international agents advocating for New Zealand overseas. The sector has excellent ideas and knows our customers. Together, with a strong customer focus, we can build upon our shared values and vision. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reactivate and recreate our industry.None of us can do it alone. I commend the New Zealand Tourism Futures Taskforce, which is championing a vision of a sustainable, thriving future tourism system.I acknowledge all members of the Taskforce and Advisory Group, many of whom are here today.While I won’t be able to catch up with you all today, I am setting aside time in coming days and weeks.I thank those who have contributed to the Taskforce’s work through the Invitations to Contribute process. Steve Chadwick and Grant Webster, the co-Chairs of the Tourism Futures Taskforce will update you on the work of the taskforce later today. I look forward to receiving the Taskforce’s report.I trust they have been bold, innovative and future thinking.Support to dateWe stepped up quickly to work in partnership with the Tourism industry at the beginning of the outbreak, and we will keep working with you.Support to tourism businesses has so far included: The $400 million Tourism Recovery Package The Wage Subsidy has supported tourism with an estimated $1.8 billion in payments to tourism operators alone.Tourism businesses have drawn down an estimated $285 million in interest-free loans under the Cash Flow Loan scheme administered by IRD, around 18% of SMEs who have accessed itThe free business advice we funded through the Regional Business Partners Network, run by Chambers of Commerce and Economic Development Agencies, has helped around 1,300 tourism businesses so far.ConclusionI look forward to working with you not only as the Minister of Tourism, but also in my other portfoliosI will take the time to meet and hear from more of you, and learn from your lived experience and expertise across the sector. I am here to listen, and to understand how Government can work with you to support, rebuild and ‘revive and revitalise’ tourism for all New Zealanders.  "
2020-11-12T03:34:31Z,        Hon David Parker,  A Progressive Agenda ,"Speech to the Climate Change + Business Conference, November 12, 2020Tena koutou katoaThank you for inviting me to speak here today. It is great to see us all come together for a common cause: to redefine our future in the face of unprecedented times. Covid-19 and climate change are two of the greatest challenges facing this generation. Both touch every corner of the world; affect just about every aspect of our lives; and threaten our country’s wellbeing and stability. Like Covid, climate change is not a distant threat – it is already having affects worldwide.According to the Ministry of the Environment’s Our Atmosphere and Climate report, New Zealand’s average temperatures are warming, sea level is rising and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. And nothing is out of its reach, from our physical and mental health to our ecosystems and economy. While Covid-19 and climate change provide a shock to the system, they also provide us with an opportunity, a chance to reset our focus and build back better.Do this right and we end up with a stronger, more profitable and more sustainable economy. I believe we are a better country than we were three years ago. The adversity we have faced as a nation following the March 15 terrorist attacks and our response to Covid has drawn us together as a people. We already had high levels of social cohesion relative to most other countries and we were lucky to live in a peaceful and calm country with Covid under control – touch wood. Our responses have shown our interdependence and built even stronger cohesion in society. We have a responsibility to act together in respect of climate change and other challenges like water and I am confident not just that we can but that we will. We are on a journey towards a credible pathway to our 2050 domestic target, of net zero emissions for all gases except biogenic methane. Our target is set in law through the Climate Change Response Act. I believe that by the end of these three years we will be able to be confident that we are heading to net zero in carbon dioxide. We need durable long-term regulatory frameworks. We also need to prepare for and adapt to climate change risks. We have an, all-of-government programme to get us on track across electricity, transport, industrial heat, agriculture, forestry, waste and our construction sector. Our energy system, in particular, presents an opportunity to accelerate our Covid-19 economic recovery, while reaching our emissions targets. We are committed to pushing harder towards a more renewable, affordable and secure system. Over the last three years, we have been busy getting a wide range of work underway. This year, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, we established the $50 billion Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund to revitalise the economy by supporting regional and local projects that provide economic stimulus and create jobs. $1.1 billion from Budget 2020 has been provided to Jobs for Nature, a programme across multiple government agencies, set up to create around 11,000 jobs, while improving freshwater, biosecurity and enhancing biodiversity. More than $100 million of the Covid-19 Response and Recovery Fund was allocated to 29 projects in six regions to help protect areas from threats like erosion and flooding. These regions are Canterbury, Tairawhiti, Waikato, Hawke’s Bay, Manawatu-Whanganui and Wellington. We passed the COVID-19 Recovery (Fast Track Consenting) Act to fast-track the consenting process for projects that boost our economic recovery, while continuing with RMA environmental precepts.  This is going well and in addition to the listed projects, I have begun making other referrals to the Expert Consenting Panel’s consideration.  We want to make big strides over the next three years in reducing waste and improving resource efficiency. We intend to set the direction, and put in place systems and infrastructure needed to better address our waste and resource recovery challenges. We want a step change, which many agree is overdue.  Sadly, much of what is currently sent to landfills could be recycled, composted or reused, so it is time for action. The Government will make improvements to reduce household waste, standardise our kerbside recycling programmes and upgrade our waste processing infrastructure.   Reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill will again help minimise our greenhouse gas emissions.And we are confronting the modern-day challenge of plastics. We already banned plastic bags, and in the coming year we plan to take action on more single-use plastic items such as produce bags, tableware and cutlery and one that I have railed against for years, non-compostable fruit and produce stickers.  We will also look at banning difficult-to-recycle single-use plastics such as PVC and polystyrene packaging, and create a $50 million fund to research and develop alternatives. I thank Eugenie Sage for her work on these issues this last term.In the building and construction sector, we have introduced the Building for Climate Change programme to improve the operational efficiency of buildings, reduce carbon emissions across a building’s whole life cycle, and improve buildings' resilience to the impacts of climate change We also delivered on our commitment to clean up our waterways by introducing new freshwater reforms, these are comprehensive and include a limit of 190 kilograms per hectare, per year, of synthetic nitrogen fertiliser on grazing land. This will in turn reduce nitrous oxide emissions from the agriculture sector, which helps New Zealand meet its climate change targets. We will continue to work with the agriculture sector through the He Waka Eke Noa partnership – supporting our farmers and growers to adapt to climate change and measure, manage and reduce emissions, while recognising sequestration opportunities from their farm. We have also made progress on getting the right tree in the right place; incentivised by the price on carbon and guided by Shane Jones made real progress.  As I have already mentioned, we amended the Climate Change Response Act.  It creates a framework for requiring emissions reduction plans and national adaptation plans.  We have begun rehabilitating the Emissions Trading Scheme which was degraded in its effectiveness during and after 2009 – so much so that it became a fig leaf disguising inaction, making our 2030 target harder to achieve.  A two-for-one deal, a cap on price with no floor, flooding of the scheme with Ukrainian hot air, the deferral on the never never of the phase out of free allocation and the exclusion of agriculture severely undermine its efficacy. It is now being reformed to incentivise business and consumers to lower their emissions. A limit on total emissions allowed in the scheme has been added. This addition was always needed in the absence of Kyoto 2 and the clean development mechanism, and was overdue.   And let us not forget, the last Government also put an end to any new offshore oil and gas exploration -- a significant move for our climate. We then developed a Just Transition Unit to work with regions like Taranaki to transition their economies towards low emissions industries. We will provide the Just Transition Unit another $5 million per year, so that it can support regions like Southland as well.  We will also invest in emerging technologies, like green hydrogen and the National New Energy Development Centre - parts of the Just Transition strategy which position New Zealand as a world leader in renewable energy. But our work doesn’t stop there. Our move away from fossil fuels will increase demand for electricity – from electric vehicles to heat pumps and industrial process heat. New Zealand currently produces 84 per cent of its electricity from renewable sources, well on the way to the 90 per cent by 2025 target the Labour Government set back in 2007. At the time, our critics said it could not be done, it would reduce security of supply and put up prices. They were wrong on all counts.  To accelerate the transition, we have brought forward our 100 per cent renewable electricity target to 2030. This is also an important contribution decarbonising industrial heat and transport. We have been investigating, as per the recommendations of the Interim Climate Change Committee, hydro schemes which pump water to manage peak demand, dry hydrological years and the intermittency of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar.  If this proved feasible it could transform our energy system and mean we would no longer need to rely on thermal base load generation such as coal- and gas-fired facilities at Huntly.  Experts have identified a pumped hydro scheme at Lake Onslow as the renewable project most likely to address New Zealand’s dry year needs. It would also provide a reliable and affordable hedge for intermittent renewables like wind and solar. This could in turn replace the future electricity price, especially compared to the counter-factual. It is predicted Lake Onslow would be capable of storing up to 5000GWh – the same amount as all of New Zealand’s existing hydro schemes combined.  At its peak, the Lake Onslow project could employ 3500 to 4500 skilled and semi-skilled workers, as well as thousands more in indirect jobs. We have committed $30 million for a business case of Lake Onslow and other smaller schemes in the North Island. We will also explore alternative technologies, and consider any that offer a better way to achieve our 100 per cent renewable target. We will invest a further $70 million in detailed design and engineering work based on what the business case finds. To make sure we have the right settings in place to reach our 2030 renewable energy target, we will put in place a new National Policy Statement for Renewable Electricity Generation. This will update guidance to local authorities when considering developments.We also intend to ban new low and medium temperature coal boilers and the construction of new fossil fuel electricity generation. We will support business through this transition by rolling out $70 million to support them to replace fossil fuels in industrial heat and connect to the grid. This could include help with transmission line upgrades, and direct support to industrial users to convert their coal boilers to renewable alternatives.Transport accounted for 21 per cent of our gross greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, and is the fastest growing source of emissions in New Zealand. Decarbonising our light vehicles fleet is one of the biggest opportunities to reduce emissions in the energy sector. We are currently only one of three countries in the OECD that does not have a carbon efficiency standard. New Zealand for too long has imported too many polluting vehicles.  We risk receiving the dirty end of the spectrum of cars produced in countries who are clearly imposing efficiency standards on cars entering their own fleet. We will rectify that by putting in place a clean car standard. Last term, we provided greater support for low emissions vehicles by co-funding over 1000 EV chargers nationwide. We have also established the Low Emission Vehicle Contestable Fund to encourage innovation and investment that will accelerate the uptake of low emission vehicles. We will continue to help New Zealand’s freight network become more sustainable and efficient, including through coastal shipping. We will extend beyond 2025 the exemptions for electric heavy vehicles from road user charges.  We made unprecedented investments in rail over the last 3 years, and will continue to invest in road, rail, public transport and walking and cycling infrastructure to get our cities moving, keep New Zealanders safe, help unlock the supply of more housing and boost productivity.  Projects on the books includes:The Auckland Transport Alignment ProjectLet’s Get Wellington MovingDeveloping a rapid transport network for ChristchurchA light rail connection from the city centre to Māngere and the airport Continuing to invest in Kiwirail and develop domestic rail workshops in places like Hillside and Woburn. We will require only zero emissions buses to be purchased for the public transport bus fleet by 2025, with the aim of decarbonising that fleet by 2035. We also want to lead by example, so the Government will continue to fund the decarbonisation of the state sector through the $200 million clean-powered Public Service Fund. We will require government to build and lease more energy efficient buildings.  But while we are investing in change, we also need efficient and durable legislative frameworks to both support the climate transition and deal with these issues in the natural and built environments.  A key priority for me is updating New Zealand’s resource management system.   We all know that the RMA has not worked as it was intended, when brought into law 30 years ago.  In short, it costs too much, takes too long and has not adequately protected the environment.  There are significant pressures on both the natural and built environments that need to be addressed urgently. Urban areas are struggling to keep pace with population growth and the need for affordable housing. It is unacceptable for this cornerstone law to be underperforming in a country that both values protection of the environment and wants to properly housing our people. In July 2019, I appointed the Resource Management Review Panel, led by retired Court of Appeal Judge Tony Randerson QC, to review the resource management system.  Under their Terms of Reference, the primary aim was “to improve environmental outcomes and better enable urban and other development within environmental limits”. The Panel’s report is the most comprehensive review of New Zealand’s resource management system since the RMA was passed in 1991.  It built on reviews by other groups including environmental and business interests, and provides a platform for change.  The Panel received a range of submissions, engaged widely and was supported by reference groups within natural and built, rural and urban, and te ao Māori, as well as a range of working groups from within central government.   The Panel concluded the new system should complement the Climate Change Response Act and the emissions trading scheme to help New Zealand achieve its emissions reduction targets, and that it should better enable a response to the impacts of climate change. The Panel made a number of recommendations, including: specifying both mitigation of emissions and adaptation to climate change as outcomes to be pursued under the new NBA – the Natural and Built Environments Act, replacement for the RMA, with national direction required for both.a new Strategic Planning Act to require regional spatial planning throughout New Zealand. Regional spatial strategies would be developed by joint committees with membership from central and local government and mana whenua, in consultation with stakeholders and communitiesa Managed Retreat and Climate Change Adaptation Act to help prepare for and fund managed retreat from rising seas and other hazards.We aim to facilitate efficient land markets while protecting natural environmental values. The renewables do this in part by separating biophysical outcomes from amenity values. The development of mandatory national direction on climate change and regional spatial planning provides opportunities to discuss what’s needed to stave off the worst effects of climate change and to adapt to the growing hazards of a warming planet. In the proposed new system, spatial planning will help integrate decision making under the Local Government Act, the Land Transport Management Act, the NBA, and the Climate Change Response Act. It will provide a longer-term view of infrastructure needs and improve coordination between different parts of central and local government, infrastructure providers and others in the private sector.There is a clear mandate for reform; and we  will now implement the reform package, which we expect to land within this three year parliamentary term.  We have a plan. And as we recover from Covid-19, I am looking forward as Environment Minister to working alongside many people here and elsewhere to do our bit to address climate change for our people, our communities, our environment and our economy. The Government is committed to a transition that is just and equitable for all New Zealanders as we guide our country to be more productive, sustainable and inclusive.  Success will rely on all of us working together - on that same social cohesion and interdependence we have shown through the adversities we faced as a people over recent years. Together we will build back better.Thank you. ENDS"
2020-11-11T10:51:37Z,        Hon Aupito William Sio,  Wellington Pasifika Business Awards,"Thank you for having me join with you as we celebrate the success of Pacific businesses tonight, and recognise the resilient and innovative entrepreneurs who lead them. Equally important to me is, that we are also able tonight to offer up our gratitude to those leaders who have organised and made this space available for the light to shine on Pacific leadership. As I reflect on all we’ve been through since the outbreak of COVID-19, I am reminded again of the strength and resilience of our community. I reflect on our community’s ability to persevere. How we have used our history, stories, language and culture to find confidence and vision. How we show kindness, hope, and love through some difficult and challenging times. Indeed, we are a people that believes in the spiritual realm. We believe all things. We hope for all things. We have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. I also reflect that if ever there was a time for strong, good, benevolent leadership to lead all aspects of our Pacific socio-economic response – now was the time that that leadership is needed. I think we need all Pacific leaders to step up.The pandemic has changed every part of our lives, from the way we socialise with family and friends, to how we work, do business, shop and travel. It has changed also how we view the world, our Pacific region, our future focus, and what’s important.Even when we secure a vaccine, we must continue to embrace the change that has occurred in our families, church, work, business and cultural spaces.As businesses and communities, you have shown you can adapt and make those changes work for you.  Not against you.As a Government we have worked hard to be there right beside you in responding to the COVID 19 outbreak, providing a range of programmes to support communities and businesses across Aotearoa/ New Zealand.  From the $12.1 billion Economic Response Package announced in March, to the $50 billion COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, which includes the commitments from the Economic Response Package, this Government has provided support to businesses through a range of initiatives and programmes.   These include the wage subsidy, consultancy support, small business cashflow loans and temporary tax loss carry-back. This support will continue to respond and adapt as we face the on-going effects of COVID-19. We have to continue the dialogue with our communities, government agencies on how we can increase support, and accelerate our response, so that we are taking everyone along with us, and that no one gets left behind, as has been our experienced in the past. Rebuilding together Last week, the Prime Minister spoke to Business NZ where she outlined the Government’s top economic priorities before Christmas which will see the extension of the Small Business Loan scheme and initiating the roll out of the Flexi-Wage job support programme. This will increase the average subsidy paid to employers to take on a worker and enable an additional 40,000 unemployed people to take advantage of the programme.The Prime Minister also confirmed that Cabinet will look to tick off more infrastructure projects to go through the RMA fast-track process over the coming weeks in order to speed up job creation.  In September we announced $10 million of funding from the PGF for the renovation and improvement of Pacific churches across the regions, and we recently announced $8million to support the Kaute Pasifika hub in Hamilton, and of course, let’s not forget the $10 million we allocated from Budget 2020 for the Wellington Fale project. But there is more work that I want to see supported in the Pacific space and in the regions.The Government is focused on two overarching objectives, to accelerate the economic recovery and to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID. Pacific Wellbeing approachFor me, I am mandated to lead a specific focus on Pacific Wellbeing. I will be looking to consolidate focus, energy and resources, and working collaboratively with my ministerial colleagues to lift Pacific Wellbeing right across the board, and to ensure that all Government agencies are working in partnership with the Ministry for Pacific Peoples to support the aspirations of Pacific communities across Aotearoa.Our values tell us we have a responsibility to look out for each other, to care for one another and to stand together.It is these values that will continue to guide us all as stewards of our Pacific communities, ensuring we will not only get through the challenges we face today due to COVID-19 but we will grow and thrive. Pacific LeadershipI believe we are all part of something larger than our individual selves. We are expressing our collective will tonight by joining to recognize these businesses and organisations this evening.   These individuals and groups we honour tonight are truly exceptional. I see them as our Pacific navigators, creators, innovators and leaders, and I am proud to honour their achievements, and we need more.As we look to the future, Pacific leadership is going to be critical to ensure decision-making respects the cultures and needs of Pacific peoples.  Our Pacific businesses and communities deserve the support they need to access the opportunities afforded to all New Zealanders. This in turn benefits all New Zealanders. This Government recognises this and we will continue to work with and support Pacific Aotearoa. When Pacific peoples succeed, New Zealand will also succeed. Pacific VisionOur Pacific heritage and culture are our competitive advantage. It is an advantage that has been expressed by all of our communities, captured and published in our report, Pacific Aotearoa, Lalanga Fou.  Through Lalanga Fou, Pacific communities told us what they needed to achieve to realise their full potential:  a vision of New Zealand where all Pacific people can lead confident, more resilient and more prosperous lives. I have used Lalanga Fou as a guide, in my discussions with my Ministerial colleagues. As a Government we have reflected this vision through the initiatives announced in response to COVID-19 as well as for Budget 2020: Rebuilding Together. Budgets and initiatives are never just about numbers. They are about values.   They are about our vision and our future. And they are about what we are doing to lay the foundations for every New Zealander to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.  For Pacific communities, our wellbeing agenda is built on four parts - supporting Pacific businesses to grow and creating opportunities across the economy for more Pacific people to enjoy meaningful, well-paid work, and successful enterprises; making sure we are training and supporting more young Pacific people with the skills they need to generate the incomes they need to support themselves and their families; providing better access to affordable homes and healthcare; and connecting more Pacific people to their language, culture and identity. Investing in our futureOur communities flourish when our Pacific peoples have work and access to learning opportunities.  Supporting and nurturing the goals and aspirations of Pacific Aotearoa requires that we walk alongside them, supporting their decision-making and their futures. But I am clear in my mind that Pacific peoples must lead, design and be the authors of our own solutions.Supporting the advancement of our communities gives them the opportunity to not only grow and succeed in their professional lives but to be a vital part of the growth and leadership of Aotearoa New Zealand.  Seizing opportunityWorking together, we can build a stronger economy and a better society.  This means building and fostering genuine partnerships between Pacific Aotearoa and you, our Pacific business leaders, ensuring we are always led by the goals and aspirations of our Pacific people.It is this relationship between our Pacific communities, our Pacific businesses and Government that is so crucial to the continued growth and wellbeing for all New Zealanders.Kia kaha everyone and stay safe. "
2020-11-11T01:19:17Z,        Hon Peeni Henare,  Commemorative address at Act of Remembrance for Armistice Day,"Tuatahi māku Ka mihi tu ki a koe PitaE pīkauria ana i te mana oNgā tūpuna o te whenua nei.Thank you Bernadette for your warm introduction.I would also like to reflect on your acknowledgments and welcome Peter Jackson, Taranaki Whānui; Members of the National War Memorial Advisory Council; my colleagues Hon Judith Collins and Nicola Willis; BJ Clark, President of the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services Association; Air Marshal Kevin Short, Chief of Defence Force and His Excellency Brigadier General Francis Agwi, High Commissioner of Papua New Guinea representing the Diplomatic Corps. On the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918, an Armistice between the Allies and Germany came into effect, ending four years of terrible fighting and loss.The First World War took an immense toll on Aotearoa, New Zealand – a country of just over a million people.It cost the lives of 18,000 New Zealanders, and left tens of thousands more wounded.While news of the Armistice was met here with relief and celebration, it also deepened the abiding sense of sorrow and bereavement that had settled across the country.Prime Minister William Massey’s announcement of peace echoed through a country whose commitment to the war had been overlaid by disillusionment and grief.As the Stratford Evening Post reported on the 13th of November 1918: ‘the ringing of the fire-bell, whistles blowing, the tin-can band of the boys’ were all ‘tempered with remembrance.’Though the generation who lived through the First World War has passed, we will always remember their great sacrifice.I’d personally like to reflect on Captain Harding Leaf, well known son of Te Tai Tokerau, soldier in World War 1 and World War 2. It is in his memory that I give this address today.As well as joining today in remembrance, we also convey our hopes for the welfare and security of our friends and allies around the world.I’d like to take this moment to acknowledge the Defence Force personnel currently deployed on operations overseas, and those currently involved in the COVID-19 response through Operation PROTECT. Many of you have been working away from home, away from whānau and friends, to ensure the safety of all New Zealanders. I’d like to thank you and your whānau for your significant effort and sacrifice.  This Armistice Day, as we honour our forebears, we remind ourselves of the dangers of division and parochialism.As we reflect on immense sacrifice and loss, we affirm the importance of cooperation and understanding.And as we remember a dark chapter in our nation’s history, we look forward with a renewed commitment to inclusion, wellbeing, and peace.Ka maumahara tonu tātou ki a rātou.
