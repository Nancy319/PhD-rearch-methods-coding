# Unveiling the Nexus of Science and Policy Communities: Studying the Science-Policy Interface Using Natural Language Processing and Network Science

This repository contains the computational methodology and code used in my PhD research, which explores the differences between scientific and policymaking communities, as well as the patterns, characteristics, and processes of science-based policy, with a focus on the COVID-19 pandemic response.

## Project Overview

This research applies computational methods to analyze nexus of science and policy communities, and the dissemination of scientific knowledge in policymaking, using the COVID-19 pandemic as a primary case study. The project investigates the gaps between scientific communities and policymaking, examines timeliness and relevance barriers, and explores evidence-based policy and knowledge dissemination networks.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by chapters, each containing the relevant code and data processing scripts:

### Chapter 3: Two Communities Theory
- Implementation of word co-occurrent network analysis to examine the differences and interactions between scientific and policymaking communities from a linguistic perspective
- Code for identifying key terms co-occurring with COVID and their topics from each community docs


### Chapter 4: Timeliness and Relevance Analysis
- Scripts for analyzing the temporal and relevant relationship between scientific literature production and policy document creation
- Code for visualizing time trends and content similarity score

### Chapter 5: Knowledge Dissemination Network
- Scripts for constructing and analyzing the knowledge dissemination network based on citation and mention relationships
- Code for creating a science-based COVID-19 policymaking process, as well as identifying the topics and actors interactions in the network

## Methodology

The research employs various computational techniques, including:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text analysis, like BERTopic, ChatGPT, Bag of Word
- Network analysis for mapping two communities' linguistic differences, policymaking process and relationships between actors and documents
- Time series analysis for examining temporal patterns
- Data visualization techniques for representing complex relationships and trends

## Data

This project primarily uses the CORD-19 dataset and various New Zealand policy-related datasets. Due to size constraints and privacy considerations, the CORD-19 raw data is not included in this repository.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves to document the research methodology for my PhD thesis, feedback and suggestions are welcome. Please open an issue for any queries or potential improvements.
