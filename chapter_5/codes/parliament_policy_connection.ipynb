There's no argument about that it is the Government's job to improve the quality of people's lives and their standard of living and their wellbeing. To actually, though, put it in the Public Finance Act, and then expect economic analysists at Treasury to measure it and report on it are two very, very different things   \n",

There's never been such an investment in disability support services. In our first year, when we came in, we invested $211 million. Last year, in our Wellbeing Budget, we invested $348 million for disability support services. But this year, this huge investment of $833 million is historic. We know that one of the things that the disability support services sector usually does is, after every year, it actually gets a top-up. So this huge investment of $833 million should ensure that we won't actually need such a huge top-up in the future. This year, we are topping up by just over $100 million, but as I say, one of the reasons why we're investing that much is to ensure that in the future we won't have to come back and top it up   \n",
