This paper reviews the Alert Level settings introduced in response to thecommunity COVID-19 cases in Auckland following the move up Alert Levels on14 February. The paper seeks agreement that one of the following two optionsis an appropriate level of public health measures to respond to the risks of theoutbreak or spread of COVID-19:1.1 Option A: Move Auckland to Alert Level 2 and move the rest of countryto Alert Level 1 with additional measures to contain the risk associatedwith the wider Papatoetoe High School community from 11:59pmWednesday 17 February 2021, to be reviewed on 22 February 2021(recommended).1.2 Option B: Maintain current settings of Alert Level 3 in Auckland until11:59pm 19 February 2021 and move the rest of the country to, Level 1from 11:59pm 17 February 2021.Situation report2. On the evening of 13 February, the Ministry of Health was alerted to twoconfirmed cases of transmission in the community (Cases A and B), with ahousehold contact (Case C) subsequently testing positive.3. As of the morning of 17 February, two additional positive cases fromPapatoetoe High School were reported, one of which was a close contact ofCase A, and the other was a close contact of the first case:s9(2)(a)3.1 Case D who was tested on 15 February, wass9(2)(a)asymptomatic and returned a Ct value of The person lives with fourpeople including Case E and it is estimated she was infectious from13 February.s9(2)(a)3.2 Case E isasymptomatic, is a casual worker at McDonalds and was tested on15 February. Work is underway to confirm which site he was working atand whether he worked during the infection period. It is estimated theinfection period began from 13 February and he returned a Ct value ofs9(2)(a),which indicates acute infection.4. Work is underway to identify close contacts of Cases D and E. Testing for theschool community continues. All close contacts in the school are in self isolationand must return two negative tests and be isolated for 14 days from the lastday of exposure, before isolation can end. All those in the rest of the1SENSITIVEschool are self-isolating and must have a negative test result before returning.The school will remain closed until further notice.5. Interviews with cases D and E indicate that the exposure events during thepotential infectious periods for these cases are minimal, with no attendance atlarge events over the period of interest.6. Contact tracing has identified 129 close contacts associated with Cases A, Band C. So far one has tested positive (Case D), and one casual contact (CaseE) who is the brother of Case D. Of the school close contacts, 30 of 31 resultshave been received. Of these results, 29 are negative, one positive and oneis pending. There are 1523 casual plus contacts. Of these contacts, 1160results have been received. There are 1159 negative results, one positive(Case E), and 363 are pending.7. The genomes of Cases A and B are identical, and are the B1.1.7 variant firstidentified in the United Kingdom. Source investigation is continuing withgenome sequencing results supporting targeted investigations. However, noscenarios have yet been ruled out regarding source, with the possibility that adefinitive source may not be found.8. Based on the evidence available thus far, the Ministry of Health considers thatwhile the risk of transmission from cases was initially considered high, thehigh number of tests across Auckland has provided reassurance that noextensive community transmission has occurred, despite the notification ofcases D and E.Response9. At 11.59pm on Sunday 14 February Auckland was moved to Alert Level 3 andthe rest of the country was moved to Alert Level 2. Boundaries have beenestablished to restrict movement in and out of Auckland. Initial evidencesuggests that these reduced movement across the Alert Level boundary in bothdirections to 50-60% below normal levels on Monday 15 February, the first daythey were in force.10. National testing guidance has been updated for the current cases and is clearthat all people presenting with relevant symptoms should be tested, regardlessof region. In Auckland, at-risk communities (including Māori, Pacificcommunities, older people and those with pre-existing conditions) should beoffered a test when presenting to primary or secondary care services, even ifasymptomatic.11. The existing testing sites in Auckland and Taranaki have extended hours andincreased staffing. Additional pop-up testing centres have been stood up atPapatoetoe High School and Sky Chefs for targeted testing.12. Testing has continued at a high level. Over 20,000 people have been tested inthe community between 14 February and 16 February.2SENSITIVE13. Of contacts at the workplace of Case B, 126 negative results have beenreturned (86 are pending), and at the medical clinic where Cases A and B weretested 37 negative results have been returned with 47 pending.14. Daily wastewater testing has been undertaken for passive surveillance at sitesacross the Auckland region since July 2020. With the exception of the site nearJet Park (and the August cluster outbreak), all sites have typically returnednegative results.15. As at 9am on Wednesday 17 February the Auckland (excluding Jet Park area)and New Plymouth wastewater testing sites returned negative test results.Results for testing sites in Hamilton, Rotorua, Christchurch and a site in closeproximity to Papatoetoe High School will be returned later on Wednesday17 February.How we make Alert Level decisions16. Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387]:16.1 the Director-General of Health’s satisfaction on four health matters: trends in the transmission of the virus, including his confidence inthe data and having regard to the risk assessment levels agreedby Cabinet; the capacity and capability of our testing and contact tracingsystems; the effectiveness of our self-isolation, quarantine and bordermeasures; and the capacity in the health system more generally to move to thenew Level;16.2 evidence of the effects of the measures on the economy and society morebroadly;16.3 evidence of the impacts of the measures for at risk populations inparticular;16.4 public attitudes towards the measures and the extent to which people andbusinesses understand, accept, and abide by them; and16.5 our ability to operationalise the restrictions, including satisfactoryimplementation planning.17. In line with our resurgence plan, in determining what comes after this immediateresponse phase, we are particularly interested in:17.1 the connection of cases to a known source at the border;17.2 the number of cases and close contacts; andSENSITIVE17.3 the geographic spread of cases, including across regions.Interim view of the Director-General18. Having reviewed the public health factors agreed by Cabinet to be consideredin relation to Alert Level decisions and based on evidence as at 12:00pmWednesday 17 February, the Director-General’s current assessment is outlinedas follows.19. Based on the evidence available thus far, while the risk of transmission fromcases was initially considered high, the high number of tests across Aucklandhas provided a strong sense of reassurance that no extensive communitytransmission has occurred, despite the notification of cases D and E.20. When recommending moving Alert Levels, the Director-General has takenaccount of:20.1 any evidence of onward spread transmission outside beyond knowncases;20.2 any concerning information arising from interviews with Case D and Efollowing interviews today; and/or20.3 confirmation that Case D and E did not go to any exposure events inweekend when they were infectious; and20.4 any positive cases outside Auckland.21. If the available information on these key considerations show that theresurgence is contained within the known cases, I recommend that:21.1 Auckland Region moves to Alert Level 2 but with additional measuresapplied to the wider Papatoetoe School community until we have morecertainty about any further spread.21.2 A Medical Officer of Health would require Papatoetoe school students,teachers, volunteers and households to remain at home (under S70Health Act 1956). Staff, volunteers, students and anyone with symptomswill be asked to get tested over the weekend. Welfare and financialsupport will be provided. The powers available under S70 Health Act aresufficient to give effect to these additional measures.21.3 Papatoetoe school students, teachers and households to remain athome (under S70 Health Act 1956) until Monday and get tested over theweekend.21.4 Papatoetoe catchment area and possibly beyond to work from homewhere possible.21.5 Schools within a catchment area still to be defined to close under s70.The catchment area would be determined in consultation with theMinistry of Education.4SENSITIVE22. I recommend the rest of the country move to Alert Level 1.23. Although there is not evidence of community transmission outside of Aucklandcurrently, there may be value in requiring the use of face coverings on publictransport at Alert Level 1, as a temporary, and precautionary measure only,while Auckland remains at Alert Level 2. My advice is that this measure, acrossthe whole of New Zealand automatically ends once Auckland returns to AlertLevel 1.24. If testing results and outcomes of Case D and E interviews trigger any of thekey considerations above reveals any potential significant exposure eventswithin Auckland, and there are no positive tests outside of Auckland, Irecommend:24.1 Auckland to stay at Level 3 with interregional movement restrictions; and24.2 the rest of country will move Level 1.25. If positive cases are found outside of Auckland, then I recommend;25.1 Auckland remains Level 3;25.2 the rest of country to be determined depending on location of outbreak.26. This view will be updated at Cabinet.Effect of the measures on the economy27. The Treasury updated their view of the economic costs to reflect the HYEFU,revising down some of the estimated impact since PREFU. These are the short-term costs, and need to be weighed against the risk of not stamping thisresurgence out quickly, which would in all likelihood require longer periods athigher alert levels, with significantly higher economic, fiscal and social costs.Indicative short-term impacts of three options are as follows, relative to theentire country being at Alert Level 1:27.1 Option A: Alert Level 2 in Auckland, Level 1 elsewhere - $100 million inreduced economic activity per week (2% of weekly national GDP); and27.2 Option B: Alert Level 3 in Auckland, Level 1 elsewhere - $300 million inreduced economic activity per week (6% of weekly national GDP).28. The current short period of heightened Alert Levels would likely mean that aproportion of the lost activity could be made up over the remainder of thequarter. Note the estimated economic costs of different Alert Levels are basedon historical data, and do not reflect how firms and households may adaptbehaviour.Proposed economic response29. On 14 December 2020, Cabinet agreed in principle to economic supportmeasures which would be introduced alongside sustained escalations in AlertLevels [CAB-20-MIN-0531 refers]. Responsible Ministers will, separately from5SENSITIVEthis paper, be seeking specific decisions on the activation of these schemes inthe current circumstances. The package includes:29.1 A nationwide Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) in the event of anescalation to Alert Level 3 or above anywhere in New Zealand lastingseven or more consecutive days (of which the seventh day may be apartial day), subject to further approval by Cabinet. Employers who havebeen affected by the escalation to Alert Level 3 can apply for the WSS.If the WSS is activated, it matches the duration of support to the timespent at Alert Level 3 or above, rounded to the nearest 14 days. Thepayment rate is $585.80 per week for each full-time employee (20 hoursor more) and $350 per week for part-time employees (less than 20hours).29.2 A Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) in the event of an escalation toAlert Level 2 or above for seven consecutive days or more. The paymentrate will be the lesser of $1500 plus $400 per employee (up to 50 full-time employees), or four times the experienced revenue drop, up to amaximum payment of $21,500. Eligibility for the RSP will be based on anincurred 30% revenue drop over a 7-day period.30. If Alert Level restrictions remain in place on Sunday 21 February at Alert Level3 (the seventh day of the current period), then WSS would meet the thresholdfor activation. If Alert Level 2 restrictions remain in place on Sunday 21February, the RSP would meet the threshold for activation.31. Other support for individuals includes the Short-Term Absence Payment foreligible workers awaiting a COVID-19 test result, and the Leave SupportScheme for workers instructed to self-isolate in relation to the COVID-19response. These support measures are available at all Alert Levels.At risk populations32. We do not yet know the extent of this outbreak and which communities will bemost affected. Māori and Pacific communities were disproportionately affectedby the August outbreak. These communities also have a higher prevalence oflong-term conditions and diseases, higher barriers to access health care andtesting, and larger households and a higher prevalence of overcrowding thatlimit the possibilities for physical distancing, all of which make thesecommunities especially vulnerable to COVID-19. At the same time, Māori andPacific community organisations in Auckland organised themselves effectivelyduring the August 2020 outbreak. There was also effective cooperation oncommunications with Māori and Pacific community leaders and institutions.Public attitudes and compliance33. A “social conversation analysis” in relation to the response for the period 13- 15February commissioned by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinetshows there are fewer people and organisations publicly voicing support than inprevious Alert Level changes. Conversation is largely neutral and informative,with many organisations sharing updates about what the Alert Level changeswill mean for them. Individuals are expressing both support and frustration overthe level changes and what is expected of them.6SENSITIVE34. The most timely and concrete indication on compliance with Alert Level controlscomes from mobility data. Mobility data from Apple for Monday and Tuesday15-16 February, shows movement was about 60-70% reduced from theaverage of the previous work week.1 This is very similar to what was achievedunder Level 3 in Auckland in August and in April/May 2020. This suggests that,at this stage, compliance with control relating to movement remains good inAuckland.Ability to operationalise restrictionsPort Waikato35. The location of the Alert Level 3/2 boundary has created some problems for thecommunity in and around Port Waikato (which is south of the boundary andtherefore at Alert Level 2). While the boundary was located so as to minimisethe numbers of people needing to cross it to access critical services and get towork or places of learning – in line with the principles agreed by Cabinet – it isunavoidable some communities are cut off from their nearest critical services.36. The issue for the Port Waikato (population approximately 800) is access to foodas the nearest supermarkets are in the Auckland region. The Ministry of SocialDevelopment is leading the provision of wrap around services to the communityincluding food, and this can scale up as required. If Cabinet decides to go to anAlert Level 3/1 arrangement, officials will prepare advice to the Director-General of Health recommending he grant a class exemption (subject to publichealth advice) to the Port Waikato community allowing them to travel acrossthe Alert Level 3/1 boundary to access supermarkets.Overall implementation has gone well37. Overall, the implementation of the current Alert Level restrictions has gonemuch better than in the August 2020 resurgence in Auckland. While there havebeen some problems with implementing the Alert Level boundary, particularlyin relation to the initial location of checkpoints in the north, this wasunsurprising given the pace at which we acted to heavily restrict travel in andout of Auckland. I am advised that traffic is moving relatively freely throughcheckpoints and there is good information available to the public on Alert Levelsettings and who is permitted to move in and out of Auckland. The governmentis connecting well with iwi in terms of them supporting checkpoints andvulnerable communities such as that in Port Waikato.38. In terms of the options included in this paper, I am confident these will all beable to be readily implemented. I am advised, however, that if cases wereidentified outside of Auckland and the public health advice was to move otherareas to a higher alert level, the NZ Police and other agencies involved inresourcing checkpoints, may struggle to provide enough personnel given theircurrent commitments in Auckland.Options1 Excluding 9 February 2021, Waitangi Day (Observed).7SENSITIVE39. Evidence continues to emerge and the situation is moving quickly. I havetherefore identified two options for Cabinet to consider, dependant on thesituation as reported at the time Cabinet meets:39.1 Option A: Move Auckland to an Alert Level 2 and move the rest ofcountry to Alert Level 1 with additional measures to contain the riskassociated with the wider Papatoetoe High School community from11:59pm Wednesday 17 February 2021, to be reviewed on 22 February2021. This Option is likely to be preferred if testing and case investigationprovides confidence that the outbreak is contained.39.2 Option B: Maintain current settings of Alert Level 3 in Auckland until11:59pm 19 February 2021 and move the rest of the country to Level 1from 11:59 17 February 2021. This option may be preferred if newevidence emerges that changes the assessment of risk.Recommend Option A at this time40. Based on the information and the advice of the Director General at the time ofthis writing, I recommend Option A. This option allows both Auckland, and therest of the country, to move down one step in the Alert Level framework, withAuckland moving down to Alert Level 2, and the rest of the country moving toAlert Level 1. I consider this a proportionate response to the risk that stillremains following the measures taken to date.41. For Auckland, this option reflects the fact that there remain only a small numberof cases identified in the community are clearly linked to the initial cases. Nounlinked cases have yet been identified despite high levels of surveillancetesting. However, some risk remains as we gather further test results and caseinvestigation continues.42. For the rest of New Zealand, a move down to Alert Level 1 reflects ourconfidence that there are likely no cases outside of Auckland.43. The standard Alert Level 2 controls do not include restrictions on inter- regionaltravel. We may see people who live in Auckland travelling around the country toattend larger events that are less constrained under Alert Level 1 measures.This is seen as low risk, given our confidence that there is a relatively low riskof undetected community transmission.44. If circumstances change from the time of this writing, my recommendationmay change.45. I propose that Cabinet formally review these settings on Monday 22 February.Additional measures at Alert Level 146. These recent events continue to demonstrate the challenges with controllingCOVID-19, particularly in advance of an outbreak being identified when weare at Level 1. Two measures that we have consistently promoted to the8SENSITIVEpublic is wearing face coverings on public transport and keeping contacttracing records as additional layers in our defence. However, in both cases wecontinue to see low rates of uptake where these measures are voluntary. Inlight of the recent outbreak it is timely to reconsider our approach.Face coverings on public transport47. On 16 November 2021, Cabinet agreed to require face coverings to be wornon public transport in Auckland at Level 1 [CAB-20-MIN-0477]. This was inresponse to the continued baseline risk, elevated by recent cases incommunity. This requirement is subject to review, but remains in place at thistime.48. I propose that we expand the current requirement for those in Auckland to wearface coverings on public transport to apply to all of New Zealand from 11:59pm17 February 2021. I propose that this setting be reviewed at Cabinet on Monday22 February 2021.49. I propose that the same settings, including exclusions, that apply to the facecoverings requirements in Auckland at Level 1 will apply for the nationwiderequirement. These settings are unchanged from those at Alert Level 2. Thisincludes exclusions for children under 12 and those with a medical conditionor disability that makes wearing a face covering unsuitable.50. This change may create challenges for long-haul scenic passenger rail servicesoffered by KiwiRail which are subject to the face covering requirement. KiwiRailconsiders that it is likely the face covering requirement that currently applies tothe Northern Explorer service is reducing demand. The application of thisrequirement to their South Island services could influence the viability of thoseservices. This issue could be considered as part of the review of this settingat Cabinet.Contact tracing record keeping51. During periods where we have no active cases and the perceived risk oftransmission is low, we have seen low usage of the COVID tracer app, whichcan make engaging casual contacts with testing efforts more difficult, and limitsthe precision of any estimates about the potential spread of infection.52. The Minister for COVID-19 Response will receive further advice from officialson usage of the COVID tracer app and other forms of record keeping to supportcontact tracing efforts. This will include advice on the impacts of mandatingrecord keeping in certain contexts.Problems with the Alert Level 3/2 boundary53. It has become apparent there is a discrepancy between the description of theAlert Level 3/2 boundary in the Order and the map in both the Order and thathas been published on the Unite Against COVID website. The description is4 to 5 kilometres south of the mapped boundary between Port Waikato and theWaikato River near Te Kauwhata. The Order states that if there is a discrepancybetween the legal description and the map, the description9SENSITIVEprevails. Checkpoints have been established to enforce the boundary as shownin the maps, and the public rely on the map, not the legal description. Thismeans there are people living in an area that is technically at Alert Level 3 butthinking they are at Alert Level 2.54. To address this issue, officials are preparing advice for the Director-Generalof Health to consider granting a class exemption for people resident in that areafrom being subject to Alert Level 3 requirements if Cabinet’s decision is tomaintain the current Alert Level 3 area. If we move to Alert Level 2 in Aucklandand Level 1 elsewhere, although there would not be the prohibition on inter-regional travel, the same approach should be taken.Financial Implications55. Imposing Alert Level controls reduces economic activity as discussed aboveand this will impact on tax revenues.Legislative Implications56. I will make or amend an Order under section11 of the COVID-19 PublicHealth Response Act 2020 informed by Cabinet’s decision.57. Before making a replacement Order or amending an Order, I must haveregard to any advice from the Director-General about the risks of the outbreakor spread of COVID-19, and the nature and extent of any measures that areappropriate to address those risks. I may also have regard to Cabinet’s decisionon the level of public health measures appropriate to respond to those risks andavoid, mitigate, or remedy the effects of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19.58. Additionally, Ministerial consultation requirements will be satisfied throughprevious consultation on template Orders for Alert Level requirements and theproposals outlined in this paper.59. The Act requires that there be 48 hours between publishing the Order and itscoming into force. This requirement does not apply if I am satisfied that theOrder should come into force urgently “to prevent or contain the outbreak orspread of COVID-19”, nor must it apply when an Order only removes or reducesrequirements.Impact Analysis60. The Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in this paper areexempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS)because they are intended to alleviate the short-term impacts of a declaredemergency event of COVID-19 outbreak. These proposals are requiredurgently to be effective, making a complete, robust and timely impact analysisunfeasible.10SENSITIVEHuman Rights61. The human rights implications of the controls in place to slow the spread ofCOVID-19 are significant and have been set out in detail in previous paperson Alert Level decisions [CAB-20-MIN-0161, CAB-20-MIN-0176].62. Relevant departments and the Solicitor-General will continue to keep anyremaining restrictive measures under review to ensure that they remainnecessary and are implemented in a way that is consistent with the NewZealand Bill of Rights Act.Consultation63. This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group in the Department of thePrime Minister and Cabinet. The Ministry of Health has provided specific inputand text, including advice on the course of the outbreak, the public healthresponse, and the views and recommendations of the Director-General ofHealth. The Treasury has provided input into relevant economic aspects.Further agency consultation has not been possible in the timeframe.Communications64. The Prime Minister will communicate the decisions set out in this paper afterCabinet agreement. Communications will be co-ordinated with theGovernment’s broader communications around its COVID-19 response. Thiswill include Chinese language communications.Proactive Release65. I intend to proactively release this Cabinet paper following Cabinetconsideration.RecommendationsThe Minister for COVID-19 Response recommends that Cabinet:1 note that on the evening of 13 February, the Ministry of Health was alerted totwo confirmed cases of transmission in the community (Cases A and B) andone household contact subsequently tested positive (Case C)2 note that one classroom contact of Case A and their sibling returned positiveresults on 17 February (Cases D and E) and contact tracing for these cases iscurrently underway3 note that contact tracing has identified 129 close contacts of Cases A, B andC so far there are three positive tests (Cases A, C and D), 75 negative tests,and 51 results are pending;4 note on 16 February, 17,439 tests were undertaken, bringing the weekly totalof tests to more than 45,000;5 note that source investigation is continuing, however, no scenarios have yetbeen ruled out regarding source, with the possibility that a definitive source maynot be found;11SENSITIVE6 note that based on the evidence available thus far, the Ministry of Healthconsiders that while the risk of transmission from cases was initially consideredhigh, the high number of tests across Auckland has provided a strong sense ofreassurance that no extensive community transmission has occurred;7 note the Director-General of Health’s advice that the Auckland Region movesto Alert Level 2 but with additional measures applied to the wider PapatoetoeSchool community until we have more certainty about any further spread andthe remainder of New Zealand move to Alert Level 1;8 note that the additional measures would be given effect through under Section70 of the Health Act;9 note the Director-General will provide updated advice at Cabinet;Options10 Agree that one of the following options is an appropriate level of public healthmeasures to respond to the risks of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19:10.1 Option A: Move Auckland to an Alert Level 2 and move the rest ofcountry to Alert Level 1 with additional measures to contain the riskassociated with the wider Papatoetoe High School community from11:59pm Wednesday 17 February 2021, to be reviewed on 22 February2021 (recommended);10.2 Option B: Maintain current settings of Alert Level 3 in Auckland until11:59pm 19 February 2021 and move the rest of the country to Level 1from 11:59pm 17 February 2021;11 agree that Cabinet will next review settings on Monday 22 February 2021;Measures at Alert Level 112 agree that the use of face coverings should be mandatory on all publictransportation services at Alert Level 1 to be reviewed by Cabinet on 22February 2021;13 note a face covering requirement would be given effect through an Orderunder the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act;14 note that I have asked officials to provide me with advice on increasingcontact tracing record keeping including through use of the COVID-19 App,and that this advice will include consideration of making record keepingcompulsory;Other matters12SENSITIVE15 note that, if Option A is agreed, the Resurgence Support Payment will beactivated from Sunday 21 February 2021 (subject to a final Cabinet decisionto appropriate the relevant funds, and an Order in Council);16 note that the Alert Level boundary has created difficulties accessing food forthe Port Waikato community and they are being supported by the Ministry ofSocial Development to ensure they have adequate supplies;17 note that if Cabinet agrees to Option B, officials are preparing advice to theDirector-General of Health recommending he consider granting a classexemption (taking into account public health advice) allowing members of thePort Waikato community to travel across the Alert Level boundary so they canaccess the nearest supermarkets;18 note that it is apparent that there is a discrepancy between the Alert Level 3/2boundary as described in the Order and represented in maps both in theOrder and on government websites between Port Waikato and the WaikatoRiver near Te Kauwhata;19 note to address this problem officials will prepare advice to the Director-General of Health recommending he grant a class exemption (taking intoaccount public health advice) to people living in the area between the legallydescribed boundary and the mapped boundary allowing them to be at the lowerAlert Level;20 agree that the pre-Cabinet consultation and consideration at Cabinet fulfils therequirements of consultation with the Ministers of Justice and Health and thePrime Minister, as required under section 9 for the making of Orders undersection 11 of the COVID-19 Public Response Act 2020; and21 agree that Cabinet’s decision today will be communicated by the PrimeMinister.Hon Chris HipkinsMinister for COVID-19 Response13"

Thepaper seeks agreement to one of the following two options to respond to therisks of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19:1.1 Option A (recommended): Move Auckland to Alert Level 1 and keep therest of country at Alert Level 1 from 11:59pm Monday 22 February 2021;or1.2 Option B (status quo): Maintain current settings of Alert Level 2 inAuckland until 11:59pm 1 March 2021 and keep the rest of the countryat Level 1.Summary2 On 17 February Auckland moved to Alert Level 2 and the rest of New Zealandto Level 1. Since then there has been only one further case (a close contact ofthe index case who tested positive on 13 February).3 Based on the available evidence as at midday on 21 February 2021, theDirector-General of Health’s advice is that Auckland should move to Alert Level1 and that there be no requirement for face coverings on public transport inAuckland or elsewhere in New Zealand.4 Consideration has also been given to whether there should be a requirementfor mandatory QR scanning by individuals with the NZ COVID Tracer App(COVID App) or other record keeping for contact tracing. Such a requirementraises equity, privacy, implementation and enforcement issues.5 On the whole, the response to the latest community cases in Auckland hasgone well. While there were some implementation issues with the Alert Levelboundary, officials are working to ensure these are not repeated in the future ifwe have to move back up Alert Levels in Auckland.6 Indicative short-term impacts of maintaining the current settings of Alert Level 2in Auckland are $120 million in reduced economic activity per week (2% ofweekly national GDP). The Resurgence Support Payment will be available asis economic support for people required to have a COVID-19 test or to self-isolate.11chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVESituation report7 Since Cabinet last considered the situation, one further positive case (linked toCase G) has been found of a close contact. Genome sequencing and interviewswith this case are underway. The cases are all in Jet Park now.8 All close contacts in the school have been instructed to self-isolate and mustreturn two negative tests before isolation can end. All those in the rest of theschool must have a negative test result before returning. The school will remainclosed until Monday 22 February 2021. A deep clean has been undertaken. Apop-up testing site was active at the school over the weekend and on-sitetesting will be continue to be available in the week of 22 February.9 The genomes of Cases A and B are identical, and are the B1.1.7 variant firstidentified in the United Kingdom. Source investigation is continuing withgenome sequencing results supporting targeted investigations. However, noscenarios have yet been ruled out regarding source, with the possibility that adefinitive source may not be found.10 Based on the evidence available thus far, the Ministry of Health considers thatwhile the risk of transmission from cases was initially considered high, the highnumber of negative tests across Auckland has provided reassurance that nocommunity transmission has occurred.Response11 National testing guidance has been updated for the current cases and is clearthat all people presenting with relevant symptoms should be tested, regardlessof region. In Auckland, at-risk communities (including Māori, Pacificcommunities, older people and those with pre-existing conditions) should beoffered a test when presenting to primary or secondary care services, even ifasymptomatic.12 Over 71,000 people have been tested across New Zealand between 15February and 21 February.13 Daily wastewater testing has been undertaken for passive surveillance at sitesacross the Auckland region since July 2020. No positive results have beenfound through wastewater testing to date to indicate community transmission.This includes the wastewater testing undertaken near Papatoetoe High School.14 On Wednesday 17 February Cabinet decided:14.1 Auckland Region move to Alert Level 2 but with additional measuresapplied to the wider Papatoetoe School community until there was morecertainty about any further spread;14.2 Papatoetoe school students, teachers, volunteers and households to beasked by Auckland Regional Public Health to remain at home and gettested over the weekend of 20-21 February; and21chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVE14.3 the rest of the country move down to Alert Level 1, with an additionalrequirement for face coverings to be worn on public transport.15 Cabinet agreed it would review these measures on 22 February, which is thepurpose of this paper [CAB-21-MIN-0025 refers].How we make Alert Level decisions16 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand:16.1 the Director-General of Health’s satisfaction on four health matters:16.1.1 trends in the transmission of the virus, including his confidencein the data and having regard to the risk assessment levelsagreed by Cabinet;16.1.2 the capacity and capability of our testing and contact tracingsystems;16.1.3 the effectiveness of our self-isolation, quarantine and bordermeasures; and16.1.4 the capacity in the health system more generally to move to thenew Alert Level;16.2 evidence of the effects of the measures on the economy and societymore broadly;16.3 evidence of the impacts of the measures for at risk populations inparticular;16.4 public attitudes towards the measures and the extent to which peopleand businesses understand, accept, and abide by them; and16.5 our ability to operationalise the restrictions, including satisfactoryimplementation planning regions [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer].17 Consistent with our National Resurgence Response Plan, in determining whatmeasures and controls should be in place after the immediate response phase,we are particularly interested in:17.1 the connection of cases to a known source at the border.17.2 the number of cases and close contacts; and17.3 the geographic spread of cases, including across.Interim view of the Director-General18 Having reviewed the Cabinet-agreed public health factors to be considered inrelation to Alert Level decisions, and based on evidence as at midday Sunday21 February, the Director-General’s current assessment is outlined as follows.31chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVE19 Based on the evidence available thus far, while the risk of transmission fromcases was initially considered high, the high number of tests across Aucklandhas provided a strong sense of reassurance that no extensive communitytransmission has occurred.20 When recommending moving Alert Levels, the Director-General has takenaccount of:20.1 any evidence of onward spread transmission outside beyond knowncases;20.2 any concerning information arising from case interviews; and/or20.3 any positive cases outside Auckland.21 If the available information on these key considerations show that theresurgence is contained within the known cases, I recommend that:21.1 the Auckland Region moves to Alert Level 121.2 the rest of the country remains at Alert Level 1.22 He also recommends the requirement for people to wear face coverings onpublic transport at Alert Level 1 should end for Auckland and the rest of NewZealand upon Auckland returning to Alert Level 1.23 This view will be updated at Cabinet in light of any further information that hascome to light.Effect of the measures on the economy24 The Treasury updated its view of the economic costs to reflect the HYEFU,revising down some of the estimated impact since PREFU. These are the short-term costs and need to be weighed against the risk of not stamping thisresurgence out quickly. This risk is likely to require longer periods at higher alertlevels, with significantly higher economic, fiscal and social costs. Indicativeshort-term impacts of maintaining the current settings of Alert Level 2 inAuckland until 11:59pm 1 March 2021 while keeping the rest of the country atLevel 1 are $120 million in reduced economic activity per week (2% of weeklynational GDP).25 A short period of heightened Alert Levels would likely mean that a proportion ofthe lost activity could be made up over the remainder of the quarter. Note theestimated economic costs of different Alert Levels are based on historical data,and do not reflect how firms and households may adapt behaviour.Economic support measures26 On 14 December 2020, Cabinet agreed in principle to economic supportmeasures which would be introduced alongside sustained escalations in AlertLevels [CAB-20-MIN-0531 refers]. As Auckland has been at Alert Level 2 orabove for more than seven consecutive days the criteria to activate theResurgence Support Payment has been met and Cabinet will be asked to agree41chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVEto this activation today. Eligibility for this payment will be based on an incurred30% revenue drop over a 7-day period.27 Other support for individuals includes the Short-Term Absence Payment foreligible workers awaiting a COVID-19 test result, and the Leave SupportScheme for workers instructed to self-isolate in relation to the COVID-19response. These support measures are available at all Alert Levels.At risk populations28 Although the full extent of impacts is not yet easily identifiable, it appears at riskpopulations have not been significantly affected by the relatively short period atAlert Level 3 and subsequent move to Level 2. We do know through communityintel, that demand for food-related support from community providersincreased. This has been responded to through existing systems.29 The Northern Regional Health Coordination Centre (NRHCC), Ministry of SocialDevelopment (MSD) and welfare agencies in Auckland are working together toprovide support to the Papatoetoe High School community.30 There has been some concern, by those in the community, that their employersmay not apply for leave subsidies leaving them without income next week. Inresponse, MSD have shared communications with local businesses aroundfinancial support available to employers and have advised employees ofsupports available from MSD should their income be impacted.31 Financial factsheets have been created and translated into languages used bythe Papatoetoe High School community.Public attitudes and compliance32 Analysis of social media channels show masks and face coverings are apopular topic presently. Sentiment is broadly neutral or negative, althoughpositive sentiment is increasing. Areas of questioning and concern are aroundexemptions for the face covering requirement, such as passengers using smallpassenger vehicles and school buses.33 Use of the COVID App, including scans and manual entries, showed asignificant increase from 14 February before decreasing from 19 February. Appregistrations have also increased.34 New Zealand Police has reported that the number of complaints received inrespect of compliance with measures dropped off significantly when Aucklandmoved from Alert Level 3 to Alert Level 2. Generally, most complaints relatedto people not wearing face coverings on public transport or the failure ofbusinesses and services to display QR codes. Police continue to use theEngage, Encourage, Educate, Enforce model, with the emphasis being onEducation.Options35 I have identified two options for Cabinet to consider, depending on the situationas reported at the time Cabinet meet:51chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVE35.1 Option A: Move Auckland to Alert Level 1 and keep the rest of the countryat Alert Level 1 from 11:59pm Monday 22 February 2021(recommended); or35.2 Option B: Maintain current settings of Alert Level 2 in Auckland until11:59pm 1 March 2021 and keep the rest of the country at Level 1 (statusquo).Option A36 This option allows Auckland to move down one step in the Alert Levelframework to join the rest of the country at Alert Level 1. I consider this aproportionate response to the risk following the measures taken to datebecause:36.1 as at 3pm on 21 February 2021, there is no evidence of communitytransmission of COVID-19;36.2 all remaining (minus any new expected cases) Papatoetoe High Schoolstudents, volunteers and staff have tested negative – close contacts atthe school must return two negative tests and go through 14 daysisolation before they can return to school;36.3 all casual and casual plus contacts have returned negative test results;and36.4 we are confident we have identified the perimeter of the outbreak andthat the cluster is contained.37 For the rest of New Zealand, remaining at Alert Level 1 reflects our confidencethat there are likely to be no cases in the community outside of Auckland.Option B38 This option would maintain the status quo with Auckland staying at Alert Level2, and the rest of the country staying at Alert Level 1 but is not recommendedgiven the assessment of the current situation.Face coverings on public transport at Alert Level 139 The mandatory use of face coverings on public transport in Auckland at AlertLevel 1 was an additional temporary measure that was agreed to by Cabinet on16 November 2020, in response to the November Quarantine case, while caseinvestigation was underway [CAB-20-MIN-0477]. This required the mandatoryuse of face coverings on public transport and drivers of small passengervehicles on all Auckland routes, and on all domestic flights.40 On 17 February 2021 Cabinet agreed that the use of face coverings should bemandatory on all public transportation services across New Zealand and forCabinet to review this measure on 22 February [CAB-21-MIN-0025].41 Although there was no evidence of community transmission outside ofAuckland, the use of face coverings on public transport at Alert Level 1 across61chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVENew Zealand was enacted as a temporary, and precautionary measure only,while Auckland remained at Alert Level 2.Director-General’s advice on face coverings42 The Director-General has reviewed the temporary measure under Alert Level 1to require face coverings on all public transport and his advice is that thisrequirement should now be revoked, and the standard measures under theAlert Level Framework for Alert Level 1 are put back in place.43 The Director-General considers that the mandatory requirement for using facecoverings on public transport is a justified and proportionate measure wherethere is evidence of COVID-19 community transmission. As there is no currentcommunity transmission, and the current outbreak is well contained his adviceis that on balance, the additional precautionary measure of face coverings onpublic transport is not required as part of the ongoing response to the currentAuckland outbreak due to the lack of firm evidence of wider community spreadthroughout Auckland and other regions, following widespread testing.44 However, the Director-General has advised that there may be other reasons formaintaining the use of face coverings on public transport in Alert Level 1 at thistime. For example, the use of face coverings is a constant ‘reminder’ to peopleof the ongoing threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and may prompt other‘desired’ behaviours including physical distancing, scanning with the NZ COVIDTrace App and appropriate hand hygiene. Thus, there may be wider benefitsfrom continued use of face coverings on public transport that support the overallresponse to the pandemic.45 It is important that all mandatory measures imposed can be well justified onpublic health grounds and are proportionate to the current public health risk.This helps to retain social licence and ensure public adherence to themeasures.46 Health advice will continue to encourage people to wear face coverings wherethey are unable to physically distance, keep up other measures such as handhygiene, coughing and sneezing etiquette, staying home when sick, scan usingthe COVID-App, and preparing for possible resurgences.Feedback from the transport sector47 Waka Kotahi advises there is general support from regional councils formandatory face coverings on council-contracted bus services at Alert Level 1.There are however wider impacts as set out below:47.1 The requirement will impact on the ongoing viability of some long-haulservices. For example, KiwiRail says the viability of its long-distanceScenic trains is already compromised by New Zealand’s borders beingclosed and the requirement to wear face masks represents a furthersignificant blow.47.2 Legally, food and drink can be consumed under the current Orderdespite the face covering requirement. However, the Ministry of Health71chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVEadvises that it is good practice to not serve food or drink to passengerswhen face coverings are being worn. Complying with the Ministry ofHealth guidance will have economic impacts for services where the foodand drink service is a business revenue stream (e.g. small passengerferries in Auckland and Wellington, or the Capital Connection trainservice in Wellington), and potential health and safety impacts for staffand passengers.47.3 Operators have also raised concerns about the welfare impacts for stafffrom regularly wearing masks for long periods of time.Comment48 In light of the above, if the requirement is retained at Alert Level 1, I recommendretaining the existing face covering exemptions (as provided in the currentOrder) for staff and passengers, food and drink, and the provision specifyingthat operators should support through education but are not required to enforcethe requirement in the meantime while further advice is sought. Officials willalso review the services that fall within the definition of public transport for thepurposes of face covering requirements irrespective of whether it is retainednow or not.49 In my view, there are two approaches to the use of face coverings on publictransport. This measure can be implemented in response to increased risk ofcommunity transmission of COVID-19, or it can be implemented as aprecautionary measure to limit the risk of COVID-19 spreading undetected inthe community. The argument between the two cases is a finely balanced one.The Ministry of Health tends to lean towards the former, while I tend to leantowards the latter.50 Public transport services such as buses and trains have the potential to beplaces of significant transmission of the virus, and have a higher concentrationof at-risk populations using them regularly. Should contact tracing reveal that apositive case of COVID-19 has used public transport, our recent experiencesuggests that tracking and testing each individual who used that service can beslow and difficult. A routine requirement to wear face coverings has the potentialto significantly reduce risk in these situations.51 I believe the challenge of face coverings on long distance public transport canbe overcome if an exemption is provided for journeys over 3 hours long, whereseats are allocated to individual ticket holders, and where the transport operatorkeeps contact details for each passenger. This would allow for rapid contacttracing where necessary. A similar requirement on public transport journeys ofshorter duration, for example urban buses, would be impractical to implement,hence my view that the mandatory wearing of face coverings is a more practicalalternative.Mandatory record keeping and scanning of QR codes52 During periods where we have no active cases and the perceived risk oftransmission is low, we have seen low usage of the NZ COVID Tracer app (theCOVID App). This can make engaging casual contacts with testing efforts more81chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVEdifficult and can limit the precision of any estimates about the potential spreadof infection. Effective contact tracing is central to our elimination strategy,particularly the “prepare for it” and “stamp it out” pillars. Our ability to conductrapid and effective contact tracing is essential to identify and isolate casesquickly and contain outbreaks.53 The COVID App is one way for people to keep a record of where they havebeen and when, and who they have been with. However, at present there aremany ways people are keeping records of their movements, including otherelectronic means or hard copy record keeping.154 The COVID App has more utility for contact tracing given its ability to identifyclose and casual contacts in the same location.55 Data on the use of the COVID App shows that scanning levels are low whenrisk is perceived to be low, but that scanning increases when perceived riskincreases (such as during the August 2020 and current outbreaks). Officialshave no way of knowing how many people are recording their movements usinghard copy or other electronic means, but this is likely to mirror usage of theCOVID App.56 People are also able to check on their movements through other means suchas general recall, receipts, or electronic banking records, and then self-identifythemselves as contacts by calling Healthline, as advised when an alert is issuedby the Ministry of Health in the media and on its Locations of Interest web page.57 For contact tracing to be effective at containing an outbreak, record keepingpractice needs to be widespread and consistent before an outbreak occurs, notjust when there is an event. Officials have considered three options forincreasing record keeping for contact tracing purposes:57.1 enhanced status quo;57.2 requirement for people to scan using the COVID App or create anotherform of record when entering a business/organisation with therequirement being on:57.2.1 the individual; or57.2.2 the businesses/organisations; or57.3 requirement for people to scan using the COVID App or create anotherform of record when entering some high-risk situations.58 The latter two options would require additional time for consultation with thebusiness community and legal and drafting work.1 This paper does not consider Bluetooth technology (such as wearables). Advice on thesetechnologies will be provided in early March 2021 in the Ministry of Health’s report-back to Cabinet onthe Bluetooth-enabled contact tracing card trial.91chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVEOption A: Enhanced status quo (recommended by officials)59 At present, New Zealanders are encouraged to download and use the COVIDApp or to use other means to record movements. The only mandatoryrequirement at Alert Level 1 is for businesses and workplaces to display QRcodes. People are encouraged to scan QR codes through publiccommunications and prompts by the placement of the QR codes at the entranceof premises but scanning rates continue to be low.60 Enhancements to the status quo to increase scanning behaviour could include:60.1 stronger messaging and changes to the COVID App to help embedscanning practice and form a habit, including targeted messaging tospecific population groups and communities;60.2 reminding businesses of their ability to encourage customers to scanupon entry or exit of the premises, and increasing the range of collateraland creative messaging for businesses to use to encourage theircustomers to scan;60.3 reminding the public that effective contact tracing supports the timelycontainment of outbreaks which reduces the need for blanket alert levelrestrictions; and60.4 encourage people to opt in and share contact details on the COVID Appto enhance the contact tracing process.61 Businesses could also be required to display more QR codes – e.g. one forevery 10m2 and at each table.Option B: Requiring record keeping (in any form, including scanning the COVID app)for contact tracing purposes62 Currently, at all Alert Levels, workplaces and public transport are legallyrequired to display QR codes that COVID App users are able to scan. FromAlert Level 2, workplaces are also required to have other record-keepingsystems and processes in place to enable a contact record to be kept of allpersons entering. Exempt from that requirement are transport stations,supermarkets and petrol stations.63 Compulsory keeping of a contact tracing record could be required with a section11 order under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 by:63.1 requiring businesses and services to have systems and processes toensure that so far as reasonably practicable a contact tracing record iscreated; and/or63.2 requiring individuals to keep a contact tracing record so far asreasonably practicable.64 Requiring a QR code to be scanned amounts to a requirement on individuals tohave to download the COVID App onto their smartphone. A requirement todownload and use a specific app contravenes Apple and Google’s terms of101chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVEservice and could result in the app being removed from both platforms. Thiswould not be the case if there was a broader record keeping requirement, whereusing the COVID App is one of several record keeping options.65 It would also require individuals to possess a smartphone, have internet accessand be able to use the technology. To ensure options for accessibility and equityare fully taken into account, officials recommend the requirement should bebroader to include alternative methods of record keeping.66 There are risks associated with a mandatory approach, as set out below.s9(2)(h)66.166.2 It would be impractical to enforce mandatory record keepingrequirements on individuals as it is not outwardly evident whether anindividual has complied (unlike with face coverings). Should therequirement be placed on business and services to enforce:66.2.1 retail and hospitality staff, in particular, are likely to receiveabuse from some customers;66.2.2 enforcement assistance may be sought to manage resultingpublic behaviour, likely requiring additional security staff, anddemands on Police resources; and66.2.3 it would be difficult for Police to establish failure to comply withthe record keeping requirement as enforcement officers wouldrequire access to an individual’s COVID App, or in the vastmajority of cases, the individual would no longer be present oridentifiable by the time Police responded to a report of non-compliance.66.3 There is a potential risk that requiring scanning or record keeping uponentering a business/service could create more queues and congregatingat entrances, exposing people to greater risk of transmission. Currently,many businesses have multiple points displaying codes within thepremises proving other opportunities for people to scan.66.4 Mandatory record keeping may also impose additional privacy risks,particularly for people who are not able or willing to use the COVID App.Manual registers (e.g. log books) are frequently used by businesses asan alternative to the COVID App. These are not privacy protective asprior entries are visible to other users. Unsecured personal informationexposes people to unwelcome contact, fraud or even identity theft.111chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVE66.5 Mandatory record keeping could risk undermining the current high levelof social license for the restrictive measures that are currently in placethe broader COVID-19 response. A mandated approach could thereforepose a risk to the government’s elimination strategy over the mediumterm (e.g. future compliance with higher Alert Levels). This risk to sociallicence would be aggravated if Police could not fully meet publicexpectations of response and enforcement. There could be a similarimpact on the public’s wider trust and confidence in Police.66.6 There could be unintended consequences, for example future positivecases that have not kept records may not want to not tell contact tracerswhere they have been or who they have been with out of fear of being inbreach of the mandatory record-keeping requirement. People also maybe less willing to scan if they are required to do so.67 Any decision to mandate requires further consideration and advice in relationto implementation and enforcement issues.Option C: Requiring record keeping (in any form, including scanning the COVID App)for contact tracing purposes in some higher-risk situations68 Another approach could be to limit the requirement for mandatory recordkeeping to locations where strangers mix and where the risk of transmissionwould be high, based on current circumstances and known environmental andbehavioural risk factors for a higher rate of transmission, such as where there:68.1 are high numbers of people in close proximity to one another;68.2 area enclosed spaces and poor ventilation;68.3 is shouting, singing or heavy breathing;68.4 area extended durations of contact;68.5 area a lack of face coverings and attention to personal hygiene; and68.6 is an influence of alcohol or other drugs on personal distancing andhygiene.69 Limiting the number of places where record keeping is mandatory might improvethe proportionality of the measure, particularly if this requirement is only appliedat times of heightened risk on the advice of the Director-General of Health. Forexample, if there has been evidence of recent community transmission or if aregion or the country is moved to an Alert Level above Level 1.70 If a mandatory approach is preferred, lead time for consultation with partnersand key stakeholders, who are most likely to be affected by any newrequirements, such as businesses (particularly retail and hospitality), industryand iwi/Māori is recommended. This is critical to gaining buy in and solving anyimplementation challenges to maintain high levels of social licence for publichealth measures.121chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVE71 Any new requirement, which is not contained in the template orders or has notbeen in a previous COVID Act order, will require additional time to consider theassociated policy and legal matters which are necessary to inform drafting.WorkSafe’s role in supporting compliance72 I have discussed with the Office of the Minister for Workplace Relations andSafety the scope for WorkSafe to support compliance in relation to theGovernment’s COVID-19 public health goals.73 I understand that his officials have advised him that it is unlikely that the scopeof the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 extends to requiring the scanning ofCOVID-19 QR codes. Similarly, it does not require the regular testing of borderworkers for COVID-19 – this is done via an order under the COVID-19 PublicHealth Response Act. This is the same mechanism used to require businessesto display a COVID-19 tracer QR code.74 While WorkSafe inspectors are authorised as enforcement officers by theDirector-General of Health under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act2020, the Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety will review this functionover the coming month to ensure that the ongoing use of WorkSafe’s fundingand personnel for a public health purpose is appropriate. This is to ensure thatthe approach balances the need for WorkSafe to focus on high-harm areas withsupporting the government’s COVID-19 response.Director-General of Health’s advice75 The Director-General of Health recommends against mandatory QR scanningby individuals with the COVID App. Consistent with the analysis above, heconsiders such a requirement would create a number of equity, privacy,implementation and enforcement issues and is likely – based on behaviourscience insights – to lead to negative outcomes in use of the app and underminesocial licence for future public health measures.Comment76 Given we have had months to increase uptake and use of the COVID App tolittle effect, we need to do something completely different. One option I aminterested in exploring is the use of “COVID Marshalls” like they have tried insome Australian states and territories. Another idea is to consider an incentivescheme that rewarded people for use of the app (but not frivolous scanning) toincrease uptake of the app. I also wish to explore whether push notificationscould be used more.Lessons from this responseAlert Level boundary77 Drawing on lessons from the August 2020 resurgence where the Alert Levelboundary cut off large numbers of people from critical services and workplaces,the boundary in the current response was much more appropriate and therewas much less friction as a result. This was also because Cabinet agreedbroader classes of businesses and services were permitted to travel across the131chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVEboundary [CBC-20-MIN-0122 refers]. Positive feedback has been received forthe MBIE-hosted service and far fewer applications for exemptions werereceived by the Ministry of Health for the Director-General’s consideration.78 However, there were still some minor problems with the boundary, the initialplacement of checkpoints and a discrepancy between the technical descriptionof the boundary and the published maps. Officials have been working onaddressing these issues if a regional boundary is needed to manage a futureresurgence.National Resurgence Response Plan79 As part of an ongoing process, officials are reviewing the National ResurgenceResponse Plan to check it remains up-to-date and if it needs amending in lightof any lessons learnt in this response.Carrying over exemptions for businesses or services to travel across Alert Levelboundaries80 Officials are undertaking work on whether it is desirable and/or legally possibleto carry over all exemptions granted by the Director-General of Health forbusinesses and services to travel across the Alert Level boundary so that theyautomatically apply if the Auckland region returns to Alert Level 3 in the future.Advice on this will be provided to relevant Ministers before the end of March.81 I note that because the Order permitted a relatively large number of classes ofbusinesses to travel across the boundary (relative to the August 2020resurgence), the demand for exemptions was relatively low. In addition,feedback from business has indicated that the process for applying wasstraightforward.82 There has also been very positive feedback from businesses about theBusiness Travel Document service established by MBIE that generates QRcodes that businesses and service can use as evidence they are permitted totravel across Alert Level boundaries.83 MBIE is undertaking an audit of the QR codes it granted through its onlinesystem to ensure they align with Cabinet’s decisions around permitted travel.Financial Implications84 Imposing Alert Level controls reduces economic activity as discussed aboveand this will impact on tax revenues.Legislative Implications85 I will make or amend an Order under section11 of the COVID-19 Public HealthResponse Act 2020 informed by Cabinet’s decision.86 Before making a replacement Order or amending an Order, I must have regardto any advice from the Director-General about the risks of the outbreak orspread of COVID-19, and the nature and extent of any measures that areappropriate to address those risks. I may also have regard to Cabinet’s decision141chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVEon the level of public health measures appropriate to respond to those risks andavoid, mitigate, or remedy the effects of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19.87 Additionally, Ministerial consultation requirements will be satisfied throughprevious consultation on template Orders for Alert Level requirements and theproposals outlined in this paper.88 The Act requires that there be 48 hours between publishing the Order and itscoming into force. This requirement does not apply if I am satisfied that theOrder should come into force urgently “to prevent or contain the outbreak orspread of COVID-19”, nor must it apply when an Order only removes or reducesrequirements. Decisions to add requirements beyond the current templateorders will take more time.Impact Analysis89 The Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in this paper areexempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS)because they are intended to alleviate the short-term impacts of a declaredemergency event of COVID-19 outbreak. These proposals are requiredurgently to be effective, making a complete, robust and timely impact analysisunfeasible.Human Rights90 The human rights implications of the controls in place to slow the spread ofCOVID-19 are significant and have been set out in detail in previous papers onAlert Level decisions [CAB-20-MIN-0161, CAB-20-MIN-0176].91 Relevant departments and the Solicitor-General will continue to keep anyremaining restrictive measures under review to ensure that they remainnecessary and are implemented in a way that is consistent with the NewZealand Bill of Rights Act.Consultation92 This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group in the Department of thePrime Minister and Cabinet.93 The Ministry of Health has provided specific input and text, including advice onthe course of the outbreak, the public health response, and the views andrecommendations of the Director-General of Health.94 The Treasury has provided input into relevant economic aspects. The Ministryof Business Innovation and Employment has provided relevant input into therole of WorkSafe on compliance and audit of the register. The Ministry of SocialDevelopment provided input on the impacts on at risk populations and actionstaken. The NZ Police, Ministries of Business Innovation and Employment,Justice, Transport, and Primary Industries, Crown Law, Parliamentary CounselOffice, and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner were consulted onmandatory record keeping and scanning of QR codes.95 Further agency consultation has not been possible in the timeframe.151chtypxg3n 2 021-11-08 10:35:51SENSITIVECommunications96 Subject to Cabinet agreement, the Prime Minister will communicate thedecisions set out in this paper after Cabinet agreement. Communications willbe co-ordinated with the Government’s broader communications around itsCOVID-19 response.

The paper seeks agreement toone of the following options:1.1 Option A: Keep Auckland at Alert Level 3 and move the rest of thecountry to Alert Level 1; or1.2 Option B: Move Auckland to Alert Level 2 and the rest of the country toAlert Level 1 (recommended).Summary2 As at 10:30am on March 5, we have discovered 15 positive cases outside MIQsince 13 February that form the current cluster, all of whom are either isolatedor recovered. All the cases are genomically linked.3 Cases M and N tested positive on 27 February and precipitated Aucklandmoving back to Alert Level 3 the next day. One further case (Case O) returneda positive test on 28 February. Case O was already isolating.4 The paper presents two options:4.1 Option A: Keep Auckland at Alert Level 3 and move the rest of countryto Alert Level 1; or4.2 Option B: Move Auckland to Alert Level 2 and the rest of the country toAlert Level 1 (recommended).5 The Director-General of Health’s interim recommendation at the time of writingthis paper is Option B for a period of six days.6 In terms of when the change in Alert Level would come into effect there arethree options:6.1 from 6:00am on Saturday 6 March; or6.2 from 6:00am on Sunday 7 March (Director-General of Health’srecommendation); or6.3 from 11:59pm on Sunday 7 March.7 There have been some significant challenges in the response to this latestoutbreak related to our usual approach to communications.11chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVE8 Agencies are working to improve how we engage with communities withdifferent language and ethnicities, including through partnering with the Officefor Ethnic Communities, Ministry for Pacific Peoples and local leaders.Introduction9 This paper has three main parts:9.1 a summary of the eight factors we use to make Alert Level decisions;9.2 a situation report against those eight factors, including the initial viewsof the Director-General; and9.3 options for changes to Alert Levels in Auckland and the rest of thecountry in the next phase.How we make Alert Level decisions10 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand:10.1 the Director-General of Health’s satisfaction on four health matters:10.1.1 trends in the transmission of the virus, including his confidencein the data and having regard to the risk assessment levelsagreed by Cabinet;10.1.2 the capacity and capability of our testing and contact tracingsystems;10.1.3 the effectiveness of our self-isolation, quarantine and bordermeasures; and10.1.4 the capacity in the health system more generally to move to thenew Alert Level;10.2 evidence of the effects of the measures on the economy and societymore broadly;10.3 evidence of the impacts of the measures for at risk populations inparticular;10.4 public attitudes towards the measures and the extent to which peopleand businesses understand, accept, and abide by them; and10.5 our ability to operationalise the restrictions, including satisfactoryimplementation planning regions [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer].11 In line with our resurgence plan, in determining what measures and controlsshould be in place after the immediate response phase, we are particularlyinterested in:11.1 the connection of cases to a known source at the border;21chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVE11.2 the number of cases and close contacts; and11.3 the geographic spread of cases, including across regions.Situation reportThe current response12 On the afternoon of Saturday 27 February, the Ministry of Health was notifiedof an additional community case (Case M). Case M is the sibling of a casual-plus contact associated with Papatoetoe High School. That evening a positivetest was confirmed for the mother of Case M (Case N). Initially there wereconcerns there was no clear epidemiological links between Cases M and N tothe cluster. However, a link has been established between Case N and anearlier case in the cluster (F) who went for a walk together during Case F’sinfectious period. Case O, the mother in a household (Cases I – L), alsoreturned a positive test on Sunday 28 February.13 At 6:00am on Sunday 28 February, Auckland moved to Alert Level 3 and therest of New Zealand to Alert Level 2 [CAB-21-MIN-0041 refers].14 Papatoetoe High School was closed again from 1 March until further notice asa precaution to prevent any further spread of COVID-19. All remaining studentsto be tested after the 22 February have now been tested other than two studentswho are on individual management plans.15 On 2 March Auckland Region Public Health Service (ARPHS) commenced aprogram of home visits to close contacts of recent cases associated with theschool. The visits are being undertaken by community service providers. Thevisits have a dual purpose of welfare and wellness support together withassurance of compliance with self-isolation requirements. Since Monday1 March, 45 home visits have been made for the self-isolating close contacts ofCases M and N.16 ARPHS continue to investigate the source of the cluster (Cases A and B) withseveral working hypotheses being investigated in line with returned test results.The Ministry of Health will report back on the source investigation shortly.Testing rates and contact tracing17 Over 105,986 people have been tested in the Auckland region between14 February and 4 March.18 Between 14 February and 4 March, 50,132 tests (41,557 people tested) in theCounties Manukau DHB catchment. An overview of testing and results isprovided in Table 1 (as at 4 March). The remaining contacts for whom testshave not been completed or results returned, will continue to be managed.Table 1 will be updated at Cabinet.31chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVETable 1: Test results for all contacts by contact type (as at 4 March)Contact Type Initial Testing Result Day 12 Testing ResultAll ContactsClose-plus Contacts 86/86 (86 negative) 7/86 (7 negatives, 79 noresult)Close-plus Contacts 170/175 (11 positive, 159 129/162 (1 positive, 128negative, 2 exempt, 3 no negatives, 33 no result)result)Casual-plus Contacts 1845/1885 (1845 negative, 655/1867 (655 negatives,(treated as close 18 exempt, 22 no result (2 1212 no result)contacts *Kmart) of which have declined atest))Casual-plus Contacts 3651/3753 (3 positive, 3648 N/Anegatives, 102 no result)Key to tableExempt contacts are those people exempt from testing, including children.Contacts with no result from initial testing may include those where a test has been taken butnot yet processed, no test has been taken yet, and a test has been refused. All contacts inthis category are being actively followed up via welfare checks.Contacts with no result from Day 12 tests include those where day 12 has not yet beenreached, noting that period for day 12 from exposure continues until 12 March.19 Of the 28 casual-plus contacts of Cases M and N with no initial test result, 14were expected to be swabbed on 3 and 4 March. Fourteen are overdue for theirday five test; 12 of these have been contacted and provided advice on testingand isolation. The two not yet contacted are being actively followed up.20 Case O has no contacts or exposures as they were already in isolation duringtheir possible infectious period.21 The Ministry of Health have estimated that there will be 65 close and close-pluscontacts who will still be required to be in isolation past Sunday 7 March.22 The ongoing management of contacts will include, but not be limited to:22.1 ongoing welfare visits/calls ensuring that the needs of the contact andtheir households are being met, including food;22.2 symptom checks (as part of welfare visits) to ensure the contacts remainwell and that they remain isolated and following directions from theMinistry of Health or Public Health Unit to contain the spread of COVID-19;22.3 support to enable them to meet testing requirements either at localCommunity Testing Centres or by way of mobile testing unit home visits.Wastewater testing23 Daily wastewater testing has been undertaken for passive surveillance at sitesacross the Auckland region since July 2020. All sites have typically returned41chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVEnegative results with the exception of the site near Jet Park (a consequence ofCOVID-19 cases quarantined in that facility). Wastewater testing results werelast reported on 5 March. Samples taken on Saturday 20 February from the sitenear Jet Park returned negative results, but samples taken from this site on 21,22, 23 and 24 February and 3 March were positive. All other results from testsacross Auckland were negative in this period, including the site nearestPapatoetoe High School.Genome sequencing24 Whole Genomic Sequencing (WGS) analysis has been completed for all 15cases in the February cluster, all of which are closely linked to each other. Allpositive community cases have been observed to have the variant20B/501Y.V1 (Lineage B.1.1.7) which is known to be more transmissible andfirst identified in the United Kingdom.Where in the incubation period are the cases?25 According to Ministry of Health none of the cases in the cluster are stillinfectious – the infectious period for both Cases M and N ended on27 February. Case O has no contacts or exposures as they were already inisolation during their possible infectious period.Assessment of the relevant health factors26 In terms of the health factors I note:26.1 There is sufficient capacity in testing and contact tracing to respond tothe current outbreak. More than 68,000 tests have been processed inthe last week. For the current outbreak, between 14 February to 28February, 15 cases were identified and over 5,700 contacts have beentraced and isolated. This compares to 2,643 contacts in August 2020and 1,766 in January 2021 and demonstrates the scalable capacitywithin the contact tracing system. Capacity is provided through acombination of all 12 Public Health Units, the Ministry’s NationalInvestigation & Tracing Centre (and their call centre providers).26.2 For the February outbreak, 88% of close contacts of a positive case havebeen contacted within 48 hours from the time a PHU was notified of thecase, exceeding the target of 80%. In response to the UK variant, a morecautious approach has been taken to intensify the identification andmanagement of contacts in some settings. As tailored approaches areimplemented, this has led to some confusion in the public domainhighlighting the need for clear communication about contactcategories. It has also challenged the way in which the Ministry of Healthand other agencies engage with communities from different ethnic andlanguage backgrounds.26.3 Although we cannot be certain of the source of the new outbreak, bordermeasures remain robust and there is no evidence of systemic failure.Demand for testing and telephone consultations over this period51chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVEdemonstrates that the public takes the situation seriously where there isrisk.26.4 The health system has sufficient capacity, including workforce and ICUcapacity. However, there are some pressures as the vaccinationprogramme rolls out. There is sufficient PPE for those for whom it isrecommended.26.5 Genomic testing has confirmed that the cases (other than Case C) arelinked and of the United Kingdom variant. The source remains underinvestigation.Interim view of the Director-General27 Having reviewed the public health factors agreed by Cabinet to be consideredin relation to Alert Level decisions and based on evidence as at 11:30amThursday 4 March, the Director-General’s current assessment is outlined asfollows.28 In relation to the current outbreak, there are several public health questions thatinform his advice.Has a source been identified that links Cases M and N to previous cases?29 Yes – a link was established between Cases F and N which means we areconfident that there is only one identifiable cluster at this point.Is there extensive community testing showing there are no community casesunconnected to the current outbreak?30 On 3 March 2021, 14,671 tests were processed nationwide, bringing the weeklytotal of tests processed last week to more than 68,000. Between 14 Februaryand 3 March, 41,557 people have been tested across Counties Manukau DHB.There were no community cases identified that were unconnected to theoutbreak.Have all close and casual plus contacts been tested and have they remained/areremaining in self-isolation until a negative test has been returned?31 The vast majority of close and casual-plus contacts have been identified andtested. Of all 2136 contacts identified through the February cluster, 2093 havehad a negative test result. 2089 have had a Day 5 test (two were exempt, andtwo had a follow-up test). Day 12 tests are due between 3 March and 12 March2021. As at 4 March, 373 of the 2136 contacts have returned negative testresults.32 2132 of the 2136 have been contacted and are self-isolating. The remainingfour have been identified and are awaiting confirmation of contact.33 However, there are 102 identified casual-plus contacts out of a total of 3753,who were exposed at locations including MIT and the gym Case M visited, thathave not received all recommended tests. These people are receiving activesupport and follow up.61chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVEHas wastewater testing in the Auckland region revealed any results that cannot beattributed to known case?34 Regular wastewater testing continues in Auckland. In the most recent testingreported on Monday 1 March the only site that showed positive results on 21,22, 23 and 24 February were from the site near the Jetpark managedquarantine facility. All other sites up until 1 March have shown negative results.Do we have confidence that there has been no community spread to othergeographical regions outside of Auckland?35 There is no evidence of community transmission outside the Auckland region.This is in the context of high levels of testing nationwide in recent weeks. DuringFebruary 2021, wastewater testing has been undertaken at sites in NewPlymouth, Hamilton, Rotorua and Christchurch. Wastewater testing at thesesites has not revealed any evidence that COVID-19 has spread.36 The Director-General does not consider that it is absolutely necessary for allclose contacts to return their day 12 test result in order for Alert Levelrestrictions to be lifted, as these contacts will already be self-isolating meaningthat if they do later become a case, they should not have exposed anyone elseexcept possibly their immediate household. Additionally, most people thatbecome cases do so within 5-7 days since their last exposure with a positivecase and would have already been identified at their day 5-7 test.Director-General’s interim recommendation37 Accordingly, based on the available evidence at 5pm 4 March 2021, theDirector-General’s interim recommendation is that Auckland move to AlertLevel 2 and the rest of the country move to Alert Level 1 from 6:00am onSunday 7 March 2021 for six days with a review on Friday 12 March.38 There are still test results outstanding. Technically the residual risks from thesecould be managed locally at Alert Level 1 through ARPHS. However, out of anabundance of caution and to cover off any potential (albeit small) residual risks,he recommends that Auckland move to Alert Level 2 until we have received allremaining test results from close and casual-plus contacts. Alert Level 2 alsoprovides a signal to Aucklanders about the need to remain vigilant and placeslimits on large gatherings.39 This advice will be updated at Cabinet.Effect of the measures on the economy40 The Treasury estimates the economic costs of Alert Level restrictions in termsof the impact on Gross Domestic Product. These need to be weighed againstthe risk of not stamping this resurgence out quickly. This risk is likely to requirelonger periods at higher Alert Levels, with significantly higher economic, fiscaland social costs. The estimated economic costs of different Alert Levels arebased on historical data, and do not reflect how firms and households mayadapt behaviour.71chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVE41 There is still considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact of theAlert Level restrictions. Treasury last formally estimated the impacts of the AlertLevel restrictions in the forecasts for the Half-Year Economic and Fiscal Update(HYEFU) 2020. Since then, Treasury has formed a view that the impact of therestrictions is likely to be smaller than previously estimated:42 GDP data from the third quarter of 2020 shows that the economy performedbetter than anticipated. This suggests that the impact of higher Alert Levels maybe lower than previously thought, at least when there is significant fiscal supportin place.43 Some proportion of the lost activity will also be made up later in the year if theperiod of heightened Alert Level restrictions is relatively short.44 Treasury will conduct a formal review of the Alert Level impact estimates afterthe release of the GDP data for the fourth quarter of 2020. In the meantime,Treasury has undertaken a very rough adjustment of the HYEFU estimates toallow for the issues discussed above. The results are as follows:Table 2: Approximate economic impacts of the Alert Level restrictionsRestrictions Reduction in economic activity per weekMaintaining the status quo: AL3 in Auckland $250 million 4% of national GDPand AL2 in the rest of NZAL3 in Auckland and AL1 in the rest of NZ $150 million 2% of national GDPAL2 in Auckland and AL1 in the rest of NZ $50 million 1% of national GDP45 It is important to note that some of these GDP losses would occur even in theabsence of any Alert Level restrictions, as people would adjust their behaviourin response to perceived risk.46 The impacts will differ across industries and within regions, for example centralbusiness districts with more businesses that rely on foot traffic typicallyexperiencing larger declines in economic activity during lockdowns and aslower recovery. A further example is the loss of large events such as concertsand sports matches which are harder to defer. This makes the economic andsocial benefits from these events less likely to be delivered and they alsofeature “sunk costs” from their preparation. These sectors are more likely toface longer term impacts if consumer and business confidence falls due touncertainty over whether there will be ongoing public health restrictions.47 As we have moved into Alert level three in Auckland, domestic airlines haveseen a significant demand impact on flights going into and out of Auckland.Given the requirement that people are not eligible to travel out of Aucklandexcept for the purposes of essential work, this is expected. Demand has fallensignificantly, which is a mix of people changing journeys, cancelling travel, orsimply not presenting for booked flights. It is not viable for airlines to continueoperating with non-commercial loadings, and as a result, we are seeing airlinespull back on the domestic network over the next few days. This will impactregional connectivity. For example, we understand that Taupo is currently not81chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVEopen to air services during this period. Should lockdown extend, or levels beraised, connectivity is likely to be further eroded.48 However, in spite of the short term social and economic costs, it must beremembered the longer-term costs of failing to move up Alert Levels inresponse to an outbreak would be significant. This is clearly evident in a rangeof other countries whose economies have been significantly impacted as aresult.Economic support measures49 Following Cabinet’s decision on Saturday 27 February to increase Alert Levels,Cabinet agreed on Monday 1 March, that the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS)and Resurgence Support Payment (RSP) would be activated [CAB-21-MIN-0043 and CAB-21-MIN-0042 refer]. The RSP had previously been activated forfirms affected by the Alert Level restrictions in place from 15 February 2020.Irrespective of what is decided in this paper, the decisions from 1 March standand the WSS and RSP will be in place for this period.50 The WSS was opened to receive applications on Thursday 4 March, withpayments being made from Monday 8 March. The RSP opens for applicationson the 8 March, with payments expected within 24 hours for most firms.51 Other support for businesses includes two employer-based support schemesavailable for those affected by COVID-19 where individuals cannot work fromhome:51.1 The COVID-19 Short-Term Absence Payment (STAP) – available forbusinesses, including self-employed people, to help pay their workerswho cannot work from home while they wait for a COVID-19 test result.The STAP is a one-off payment of $350 and includes those on casualcontracts who need to miss work.51.2 The Leave Support Scheme (LSS) – for those who meet certain criteriaand have be told to self-isolate, cannot go to work, and cannot work fromhome. Employers, including self-employed people can access thisscheme. The LSS is paid as a lump sum and covers two weeks for eacheligible employee – it is paid at a rate of $585.80 per week for peopleworking 20 hours or more (full time rate), and $350 per week for thoseworking less than 20 hours (part time rate). The employer must pay theiremployees any amount required by the employment agreement andemployment legislation. While employers are able to access the schemefor casual workers, they need to meet their obligations to retain workersfor the duration of the payment. This could include either part-time or full-time staff.52 The Ministry of Social Development has seen an increase in the total numberof applications for the STAP over February 2021:52.1 87 applications approved in the week ending 12 February, with $29,400paid to employers;91chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVE52.2 1,209 applications approved in the week ending 19 February, with$483,700 paid to employers; and52.3 2,268 applications approved in the week ending 26 February, with$1.019 million paid to employers.53 The number of Leave Support Scheme applications continues to increase –with 3,000 applications approved between 31 July 2020 and 26 February 2021and $19.382 million being paid out under this scheme. The current spend underthis scheme is lower than the $126 million forecast for 2020/21 by the Treasurywhen the Leave Support Scheme was established last May.54 Officials are tracking the number of applications approved over the week ending5 March as an indicator of the level of support that Aucklanders have accessedduring Alert Level 3. From 12 March 2021, weekly information on the LeaveSupport Scheme and Short -Term Absence Payment will be published on theMinistry of Social Development website.55 There is also non-COVID-19 support that individuals and families can seek viaWork and Income, including:55.1 support for those on a low income who may need help with essentialcosts (e.g. food, accommodation costs, utilities, medical and dentalcosts). The type of support depends on a client’s individualcircumstances (income and assets, partner’s situation, etc).55.2 a range of financial supports available for working families, includingthose who are struggling due to COVID-19. This may include hardshipassistance or main benefit supportImpacts on at risk populations56 Communities with a higher prevalence of long-term conditions and diseases,higher barriers to access health care and testing, and larger households and ahigher prevalence of overcrowding that limit the possibilities for physicaldistancing are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Such communities, acrossvarious ethnicities, are prevalent in the current cluster.57 A number of exposure sites in this cluster have high numbers of casual workers.Access to employment and the concern of losing income along with access toeducation are two areas of concern that have been noted as generatingsignificant fear and anxiety amongst the wider population.58 Pacific communities have expressed concern over the impacts of lockdown onRSE workers, the pressures on families who are unable to return home andmanagement of internal/personal issues due to schemes not being properlymanaged. At the same time there is growing concern for overstayers’ welfareand the exacerbated financial pressures impacting Pacific churches andcommunities.59 Agencies have focussed on supporting the different communities in SouthAuckland (including for disabled people, older people and ethnic communities).101chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVEThere has been effective communication by Government with Māori and Pacificcommunity leaders and institutions60 The Ministry of Social Development (working with Te Puni Kōkiri and Ministryfor Pacific Peoples) have updated their website with a list of providers in SouthAuckland who have been supported with additional funding for COVID-19response and recovery, with think to other funding within agencies. In addition,some of the providers have been proactively contacted to understand whatfurther support needs providers may have over and above funding and servicesthat has been provided for resurgence activity.61 Overall schools, early learning services and tertiary education providers aredoing well. The Ministry of Education is confident that Auckland-basedservices, schools and organisations are implementing appropriate measuresfor their staff and children, students and whānau. The Ministry of Education andTEC continue to work closely with services, schools and providers.62 The Ministry reports that “Alert Level fatigue” is noticeable at some schoolsoperating at Alert Level 3. Staff are anxious about being onsite and the risk itposes to themselves and their families. Some parents are working from homeand sending their children to school as it is difficult for them to manage athome. This is putting pressure on schools to manage more children onsite atAlert Level 3 than previous events.Cross boundary travel and exemptions63 When Auckland moved back to Alert Level 3 on 28 February the sameboundary was used for when Auckland had previously been at Alert Level 3(with the addition of Port Waikato and a correction between there and TeKauwhata). Also the same categories of movement across the boundary werepermitted and the Director-General of Health carried over exemptions forindividuals granted under the previous Alert Level 3/2 Order.64 The Business Travel Documentation system developed by the Ministry forBusiness, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) continues to function well. TravelDocuments issued previously remain valid and do not need to be reissued.Exemption decisions are being returned to applicants within the 2-dayturnaround target. MBIE and Health report that these applications have sloweddown throughout the week.65 Police report that people are generally aware of the need for evidence to justifytravel between Alert Levels and have only had to turn 2 percent of traffic awayfrom the boundary. As at 3 March, Police report 58,633 vehicles were stoppedat boundary checkpoints since 6am on 28 February. The low volume of trafficbeing turned around also supported the view that people are not travellingunless they need to.66 As at 4 March:66.1 The Ministry of Health received 4030 applications for personal travelexemptions. Of those, 2044 were automatically granted as they werepermitted reasons under the Order.111chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVE66.2 MBIE had issued 35,093 individual travel documents for businessreasons.67 In order to ensure the system is not being abused, agencies are conducting aspot check of the documentation issued automatically through the MBIE systemfor permitted travel during the period from 14-17 February. MBIE does have theability to cancel any QR codes if needed and will work with industry groups ifthere are any systematic compliance issues in any particular sector.68 There was a steady build-up of traffic at checkpoints on Sunday from mid-morning with some queues forming. Southern queues eventually dissipated by2am. North queues eased that night. Traffic flow throughout the day on 1 Marchwas manageable with no major issues reported. Waka Kotahi reported that on4 March traffic flow across the Alert Level boundary was 30-45 percent lessthan normal.69 The relatively modest reduction in travel across the Alert Level boundary, andthat generally there have been relatively few issues with the boundary, reflectthat the current Order permitted a high level of movement across the boundarycompared to the August 2020 resurgence. Specifically, it continued thecategories of businesses and services permitted to cross the boundary thatwere included in the 14 February Order. This included all of Category 2businesses and services that Cabinet has previously noted would likely bepermitted but for which an assessment would be required in each resurgence[CBC-20-MIN-0122 refers].Public attitudes and compliancePublic attitudes70 Since 1 March, negative sentiment on Unite Against COVID social mediachannels increased by 5 percent to 18 percent compared with the previousweek. Comments were aimed more towards individuals who did not self-isolate(which it is perceived as the cause of the Alert Level change) than about movingback up Alert Levels.71 Understanding the changes to contact tracing has been confusing for people.In particular the new categories of casual-plus and close-plus contacts, anddifferent instructions for household members depending on whether they werecustomers or staff at a location of interest is contributing to this. Agencies areworking together to strengthen the communications approach regarding schooloutbreaks.72 There have also been concerns raised by Pacific and ethnic communities andagencies about the effectiveness of the communications to ethnic, disabledcommunities, particularly youth in those communities.73 Government communications channels have continued to ensure thatmessaging is easy to understand, with plain language, that there is effectiveuse of visual messaging (such as posters) and video messages, a wide rangeof distribution channels and methods of communication are utilised to increase121chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVEaccessibility, and there is a more systematic approach to translating messagesinto a wider range of languages, in written, visual, and video formats.74 The Unite Against COVID-19 website has information translated in 25 differentlanguages, and detailed information about welfare support available has beentranslated into 12 languages, including Hindi, Punjab and Vietnamese, toensure wider reach into vulnerable populations.75 Social license remains crucial to a successful COVID-19 response. The publicreaction to particular individuals who have not used the COVID-19 tracer appor otherwise failed to follow good practices suggests a possible erosion of this.Further erosion could undermine the overall response. Communications aboutthe response should continue to reinforce the need to stay the course, followthe usual hygiene measures, scan the COVID-19 tracer app and continue‘being kind’. Reinforcing positive communications messaging might go someway to help reverse the 5 percent increase in negative sentiment on socialmedia channels.Behaviours to support contact tracing76 Rates of use of the COVID-19 Tracer App continue to be relatively low. As at2 March there had been around 1.5 million a day for the past week (there areover 2.5 million registered users of the App). The Department of Prime Ministerand Cabinet and the Ministry of Health are working to promote use and high-quality capture of information needed for rapid contact tracing via the COVID-19 Tracer App. They will provide me with advice on how to increase behavioursthat support fast and accurate contact tracing next week.Compliance with restrictions on movement between Alert Level areas77 Police report that on the whole people have generally been cooperative and areappreciative of the circumstances.78 To support the alert level changes, Avsec staff were deployed to the front doorsof Auckland Airport on Sunday 28 February to assist with checking passengerstravelling were permitted to do so under the travel restrictions. Whilst there werequeues outside the terminal on Sunday in particular, Avsec reports that peoplewere generally tolerant and understanding of the need for the measures. Avsecis working closely with Auckland Airport to ensure systems are working and fitfor purpose. At the other five main airports, Avsec is also checking those goingto Auckland, either at the gate or at the screening point.79 In general, the majority of general complaints through Police and the UniteAgainst COVID-19 website appear to be quite low level and relate tobusinesses not displaying QR codes, small gatherings, and people socialising.80 Between 28 February and 3 March, WorkSafe undertook 55 assessments inAlert Level 2 and 3 regions relating to COVID-19. As at 4 March, six verbaldirections had been issued, including three in Auckland relating to contacttracing and QR code displays.131chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVEOptions81 Based on information to date, the situation suggests a single cluster ofconnected cases in a region, with no evidence of wider spread in the regionand no cases in other regions. This suggests Auckland should move to AlertLevel 2, and the rest of the country to Level 1, while retaining face coverings onpublic transport.82 The critical question is how long we should wait before moving down alertlevels. Central to this is when the last known case was infectious and ourconfidence that all the contacts that person had in that time are being isolatedand checked on. It appears that the UK variant (which genome sequencingconfirms these cases are) has “a longer tail” meaning infections may notemerge until later suggesting we should perhaps delay moving down alertlevels.83 The Ministry of Health’s advice is that none of the cases in the current clusterare still in their infectious period.84 I have identified two options for Cabinet to consider, dependant on the situationas reported at the time Cabinet meets, that I consider are appropriate measuresin response to the level of public health risk:84.1 Option A: Keep Auckland at Alert Level 3 and the rest of country moveto Alert Level 1 to contain the cluster in Auckland;84.2 Option B: Move Auckland to Alert Level 2 and the rest of the country toAlert Level 1 contingent on there being no further cases identified thatpoint to there being undetected community transmission;85 At the time of writing, informed by the advice of the Director-General of Healthand adopting a precautionary approach, I recommend Option B. The Director-General of Health recommends the change in Alert Level come into effect onSunday 7 March for a period of six days (following a review on Friday 12 March).Option A86 Under this option Auckland stays at Alert Level 3 while the rest of the countryreturns to Alert Level 1.87 This option makes sense if:87.1 we are confident there is a very low chance there are undetected casesoutside of the Auckland region – in large part this reflects confidence inour Alert Level boundary and restrictions on travel; but87.2 we are not confident there is no risk of undetected transmission in theAuckland region.88 It would balance the economic and social costs of restrictions of Level 2 againstthe small risk of emergence of the virus, particularly in areas very distant fromAuckland. However, cases may emerge in other regions that we have not yetseen and could spread quickly in a Level 1 environment with relatively few141chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVErestrictions. An interregional boundary would continue to need to be enforcedwith particular thinking needed about how to manage the very big change inAlert Level settings between Levels 3 and 1, particularly whether or not Cabinetwould want to reduce the number of permitted travel categories to avoid spreadout of Auckland.Option B89 This option allows Auckland to move down to Alert Level 2 and the rest of thecountry to return to Alert Level 1. I consider this a proportionate response to therisk following the measures taken to date because:89.1 No new positive cases have been identified since 28 February 2021.89.2 All positive cases identified are contacts of the recent community casesand are either recovered or in self-isolation, with their close contactsalready contacted or in self-isolation.89.3 All but 11 remaining (minus any new expected cases) Papatoetoe HighSchool students, volunteers and staff have tested negative. Closecontacts at the school must return two negative tests and go through 14days isolation before they can return to school.89.4 We are confident that we have identified the perimeter of the outbreakand that the cluster is contained and that we can manage the tail throughidentifying, testing and isolating any contacts.90 The rest of New Zealand returning to Alert Level 1 reflects our confidence thatit is very unlikely there are undetected cases in the community outside ofAuckland both generally and connected to the current cluster. While Level 2allows most economic activity to take place it has also seen the widespreadcancellation of events which has a significant effect in some sectors andregions.Trade-offs and choices91 Option A maintains the precautionary approach currently in place outside ofAuckland while giving us more time to fully understand the extent of theoutbreak. Options B has a lower economic and social cost, however, is riskierif the cluster is not under control and there is a need for further alert levelincreases again in the near future.92 Given the lack of community transmission and rate of testing to date, Option Bhas been recommended by the Director-General in his interim advice.Timing93 The change to Alert Level could come into effect at either:93.1 6:00am on Saturday 6 March; or93.2 6:00am on Sunday 7 March (Director-General of Health’srecommendation); or151chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVE93.3 11:59pm on Sunday 7 March.Alert Level boundary94 Under both options the Alert Level boundary in the current Order wouldcontinue. However, if Auckland moved to Alert Level 2 and the rest of thecountry to Alert Level 1 (Option B) there would be no checkpoints as therewould be no prohibition on cross-boundary travel under that option.95 If Cabinet agrees to Option A, officials propose the categories of permittedmovement across the Alert Level boundary under the current settings arepreserved.Ability to operationalise the proposals in this paper96 We are well placed to implement all of the options presented in this paper.97 Under both Options A and B the current Alert Level boundary would continue(under Option B there would be no prohibition on cross boundary travel). Interms of checkpoints the necessary mechanisms and resourcing is already inplace. More generally, compliance and welfare support processes are in placeand working well. As noted above, support is being provided to/through ARPHSand/to ethnic community leaders to vulnerable communities are getting thenecessary support. Work is also underway to simplify and clarify howcommunities can access support for communities and achieve better inter-agency coordination.98 There has been huge demand for Healthline services over the past week in partdue to confusion caused by the additional categories of contacts that haverecently been introduced. Officials are working to clarify advice – especiallyregarding self-isolation following testing.Financial Implications99 Imposing Alert Level controls reduces economic activity as discussed aboveand this will impact on tax revenues.Legislative Implications100 I will make or amend an Order under section 11 of the COVID-19 Public HealthResponse Act 2020 informed by Cabinet’s decision.101 Before making a replacement Order or amending an Order, I must have regardto any advice from the Director-General about the risks of the outbreak orspread of COVID-19, and the nature and extent of any measures that areappropriate to address those risks. I may also have regard to Cabinet’s decisionon the level of public health measures appropriate to respond to those risks andavoid, mitigate, or remedy the effects of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19.102 Additionally, Ministerial consultation requirements will be satisfied throughprevious consultation on template Orders for Alert Level requirements and theproposals outlined in this paper.161chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVE103 The Act requires that there be 48 hours between publishing the Order and itscoming into force. This requirement does not apply when an Order onlyremoves or reduces requirements. Any decisions to add requirements beyondthe current template orders will take more time.Impact Analysis104 The Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in this paper areexempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS)because they are intended to alleviate the short-term impacts of a declaredemergency event of COVID-19 outbreak. These proposals are requiredurgently to be effective, making a complete, robust and timely impact analysisunfeasible.Human Rights105 The human rights implications of the controls in place to slow the spread ofCOVID-19 are significant and have been set out in detail in previous papers onAlert Level decisions [CAB-20-MIN-0161, CAB-20-MIN-0176].106 Relevant departments and the Solicitor-General will continue to keep anyremaining restrictive measures under review to ensure that they remainnecessary and are implemented in a way that is consistent with the NewZealand Bill of Rights Act.Population impacts107 Population impacts are discussed in paragraphs 57-63.Consultation108 This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group in the Department of thePrime Minister and Cabinet. The Ministry of Health has provided specific inputand text, including advice on the course of the outbreak, the public healthresponse, and the views and recommendations of the Director-General ofHealth. [The Treasury; NZ Police; Ministries of Social Development; Business,Innnovation and Employment; Transport, and Pacific Peoples; Waka Kotahiand the Office of Ethnic Communities have provided input into relevant parts ofthe paper. Further agency consultation has not been possible in the timeframe.Communications109 The Prime Minister will communicate the decisions set out in this paper afterCabinet agreement. Communications will be co-ordinated with theGovernment’s broader communications around its COVID-19 response. Thiswill include Chinese language communication channels.110 When a decision is taken to move alert levels, it is important to provide earlynotification to international partners who may be affected by, and who may havesome effect on the successful implementation of, such a change. Jurisdictionswith whom New Zealand currently has, or is negotiating, one- or two-wayquarantine-free travel arrangements (Australia, Cook Islands, Niue) requirenotification to inform their health and border decision-making and provide171chtypxg3n 2021-03-08 12:18:22SENSITIVEcertainty to travellers. Foreign diplomatic and consular representatives basedin, or accredited to, New Zealand require notification to allow the continuationof consular support to foreign nationals currently in New Zealand, which canhelp amplify (and translate) government messaging.

The paperseeks agreement to one of the following options:1.1 Option A: Maintain current settings with Auckland at Alert Level 2 andthe rest of the country at Alert Level 1; or1.2 Option B: Move Auckland to Alert Level 1 along with the rest of thecountry at Alert Level 1 (recommended).Summary2 The February Auckland cluster comprises 15 positive community cases outsideMIQ since 13 February. All of the cases are either in a quarantine facility (1) orrecovered (14). All the cases are genomically linked. Of all the contactsassociated with the cluster, 99 percent have now been tested.3 The paper presents two options:3.1 Option A: Maintain current settings with Auckland at Alert Level 2 andthe rest of the country at Alert Level 1 for a further period of seven days;or3.2 Option B: Move Auckland to Alert Level 1 along with the rest of thecountry at Alert Level 1.4 The move to Alert Level 1 in Option B could come into effect at either:4.1 11:59pm Thursday 11 March; or4.2 11:59pm on Friday 12 March.5 The Director-General of Health considers the current outbreak is well containedand his interim recommendation at the time of writing this paper is Option B. Interms of timing, he initially advised a move to Alert Level 1 at 6:00am onSaturday 13 March to give a full 14 day cycle of the virus since the additionalcase was discovered on 27 February 2021. However, based on the availableevidence as at 9:30am Thursday 11 March 2021, that the gym contacts haveall now returned negative tests, his interim advice is that there is no additionalpublic health risk in bringing that time forward to 11:59pm Thursday 11 March.Introduction6 This paper has four main parts:157uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVE6.1 a summary of the eight factors we use to make Alert Level decisions;6.2 a situation report against the four health factors including the interimadvice of the Director-General;6.3 options for changes to Alert Levels in Auckland and the rest of thecountry; and6.4 an assessment of the options against the four non-health factors.How we make Alert Level decisions7 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand:7.1 the Director-General of Health’s satisfaction on four health matters:7.1.1 trends in the transmission of the virus, including his confidencein the data and having regard to the risk assessment levelsagreed by Cabinet;7.1.2 the capacity and capability of our testing and contact tracingsystems;7.1.3 the effectiveness of our self-isolation, quarantine and bordermeasures; and7.1.4 the capacity in the health system more generally to move to thenew Alert Level;7.2 evidence of the effects of the measures on the economy and societymore broadly;7.3 evidence of the impacts of the measures for at risk populations inparticular;7.4 public attitudes towards the measures and the extent to which peopleand businesses understand, accept, and abide by them; and7.5 our ability to operationalise the restrictions, including satisfactoryimplementation planning [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer].8 In line with our resurgence plan, in determining what measures and controlsshould be in place after the immediate response phase, we are particularlyinterested in:8.1 the connection of cases to a known source at the border;8.2 the number of cases and close contacts; and8.3 the geographic spread of cases, including across regions.257uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVEThe current response9 On Sunday 14 February Auckland was moved to Alert Level 3 and the rest ofthe country to Alert Level 2. Boundaries were established to restrict movementin and out of the Auckland region [CAB-21-MIN-0020 refers].10 Following a move back to Alert Level 2 in Auckland and Alert Level 1 for therest of the country, two positive cases were reported on 27 February – CasesM and N [CAB-21-MIN-0025 refers]. Initially there was no known genomic linkto the cluster’s index cases (though this was later established). These casesprecipitated Auckland going back to Alert Level 3 at 6:00am on 28 February,and the rest of the country to Alert Level 1 [CAB-21-MIN-0041 refers].11 At 6:00am on Sunday 7 March, Auckland was moved to Alert Level 2 and therest of New Zealand to Alert Level 1 [CAB-21-MIN-0041 refers].Situation report12 The current February Auckland cluster comprises 15 positive community cases.All of the cases are either recovered (14) or quarantined (1). All the cases aregenomically linked.13 Following the move to Alert Level 2 on 7 March there were some test resultsoutstanding from casual plus contacts of Case M who may have been exposedat the gym he visited on 26 February 2021. All of those contacts who requiretesting have now returned negative test results with the exception of one personwho refused the test but is in self-isolation and is being supported with anindividual care plan. Casual-plus contacts are not subject to day 12 testing.14 Day 12 tests are due for 15 close or close-plus contacts over the next few daysand are being followed up. Results are expected on Friday 12 March. Theoutstanding contacts relate to the Kmart exposure event and are beingmanaged by the Ministry of Health and Auckland Regional Public HealthService (ARPHS). The Director-General does not consider it is absolutelynecessary for all close contacts to return their day 12 test result in order forAlert Level restrictions to be lifted, as these contacts are already self-isolating.15 Of all the contacts in the February cluster, 99 percent have now completed theirtesting and isolation requirements. The remaining contacts have been closedthrough a public health determination by the Director of Public Health.16 On Sunday 7 March an Air NZ crew member returned a positive test resultduring routine surveillance testing. This case regularly works on a routebetween Auckland and Tokyo. They are being managed as a border-relatedcase and are in a quarantine facility. The Case followed all protocols as an aircrew member. Contact tracing is currently underway to identify locations ofinterest and contacts but the case had minimal exposure events and so far allclose contacts have tested negative. There are currently no MIF casesidentified in New Zealand who have been on flights that the Case worked on.17 The most likely working hypothesis of the case’s exposure to infection is whilein Japan, however other sources of infection cannot be ruled out.357uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVEDirector-General of Health’s interim assessment against the health factorsTrends in transmission18 The current outbreak appears to be well contained given the data we have sofar, especially the negative results for all close contacts. Although there are asmall number of outstanding day 12 tests from close contacts, these will beavailable on Friday 12 March (ahead of the recommended move to AlertLevel 1).Testing rates and contact tracing19 Testing has continued to be at a high level in recent weeks. On 10 March 2021,6,448 tests were processed, bringing the weekly total of tests processed overthe previous 7 days (4-10 March) to more than 50,000.20 From 28 February 2021 (when Auckland most recently went to Alert Level 3) to9 March 2021, 19,141 test results were returned within Counties Manukau DHBwhich includes the South Auckland region. Across all DHBs, there have been67,549 test results returned between 28 February 2021 to 9 March 2021.Table 1: Test results for all contacts by contact type (as at 8:30am 10 March)Contact Type Initial Testing Result Day 12 Testing ResultAll ContactsClose + Contacts 88/88 (88 negative) 75/88 (75 negative, 11outstanding, 2 no furtheraction required)Close Contacts 179/183 (no outstanding, 11 160/170 (1 positive, 159positive, 168 negative, 2 negative, 4 outstanding, 6 noexempt, 2 no further action further action requiredrequired (1 low risk exposure (infants))and 1 missed day 5 testingbut tested positive at day12))Casual + Contacts 1930/1967 (1930 negative, 1938/1945 (1938 negative, 7(treated as close 22 exempt, 15 no further no further action required)contacts) action required)Casual + Contacts 3708/3776 (3 positive, 3705 N/Anegative, 3 exempt, 1refused, 64 no further actionrequired)KeyExempt contacts are those people exempt from testing, including children.Contacts with no result from initial testing may include those where a test has been takenbut not yet processed, no test has been taken yet, and a test has been refused. All contactsin this category are being actively followed up via welfare checks.Contacts with no result from Day 12 tests include those where day 12 has not yet beenreached, noting that period for day 12 from exposure continues until 12 March. Theseresults are expected to be returned on Friday 12 March.21 Regular wastewater testing continues in Auckland. In the most recent testingreported on Thursday 11 March the only site that showed positive results (on2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 March) were from the site near the Jet Park managed quarantine457uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVEfacility. Wastewater testing was also undertaken at sites in New Plymouth,Hamilton, Rotorua and Christchurch. Wastewater testing at these sites has notrevealed any evidence of COVID-19 in these locations. Results from samplestaken on 7, 8 and 9 March will be reported on the afternoon of Thursday11 March.22 Current contact tracing capacity is sufficient to manage 350 cases per day.23 There are approximately 2.74 million registered NZ COVID Tracer app users,as of 10:00 am on 10 March 2021. Just over 970,000 poster scans were notifiedsince midday on 9 March. Just over 1,268,000 devices had Bluetooth active.Effectiveness of our self-isolation, quarantine and border measures24 Auckland Regional Public Health have been managing all positive cases closelyand is comfortable that requirements are being observed. Clear guidance hasbeen provided to those who have been tested to remain in isolation until theyreceive a negative test result.Health system capacity generally25 There is currently one person in hospital with COVID-19 (a border case). Whilehospitals are currently operating a high capacity, DHBs have plans in place tomanage a surge in demand associated with new outbreaks.26 There are good stocks of personal protective equipment, swabs and other testconsumables.27 Counties Manukau DHB and Auckland Regional Public Health Service(ARPHS) report that the current outbreak has placed a heavy demand ontesting, contact tracing and case management services and that they havestretched capacity. They also note that this pressure is further compounded bythe forthcoming additional requirements for testing MIQ workers and vaccinerollout.Options28 I have identified two options for Cabinet to consider, dependant on the situationas reported at the time Cabinet meets, that I consider are appropriate measuresin response to the level of public health risk:28.1 Option A: Maintain current settings with Auckland at Alert Level 2 andthe rest of the country at Alert Level 1; or28.2 Option B: Move Auckland to Alert Level 1 along with the rest of thecountry at Alert Level 1.29 The critical question is how long we should wait before moving down AlertLevels. Central to this is when the last known case was infectious and ourconfidence that all the contacts that person had in that time are being isolatedand checked on. It appears that the UK variant (which genome sequencingconfirms these cases are) has “a longer tail” meaning infections may not557uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVEemerge until later, hence the slower move down Alert Levels for the Aucklandregion.30 Based on information to date, the situation suggests a single cluster ofconnected cases in a region, with no evidence of wider spread in the regionand no cases in other regions. This suggests Auckland should move to AlertLevel 1 along with the rest of the country.31 I also recommend face coverings should be retained on public transport toreduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 between passengers wherephysical distancing is difficult, with the same exemptions as we have currently.Option A32 Under this option Auckland stays at Alert Level 2 and the rest of the country atAlert Level 1. This option makes sense if we are not confident there is no riskof undetected transmission in the Auckland region.33 In light of the Director-General’s advice, I do not consider this to be the caseand therefore do not recommend this option.Option B34 This option allows Auckland to move down to join the rest of the country at AlertLevel 1. I consider this a proportionate response to the risk following themeasures taken to date because, at the time of writing this paper:34.1 as at 11 March no new positive cases have been identified in thecommunity since 28 February 2021; and34.2 I am confident we have identified the perimeter of the outbreak and thatthe cluster is contained, and that we can manage the tail throughidentifying, testing and isolating any contacts.35 The rest of New Zealand remaining at Alert Level 1 reflects our confidence it isvery unlikely there are undetected cases in the community outside of Aucklandboth generally and connected to the current cluster.Trade-offs and choices36 Option A maintains the precautionary approach currently in place with Aucklandon a higher Alert Level to give us more time to fully determine whether theoutbreak has been contained. Option B has a lower economic and social cost.However, it is riskier if the cluster is not under control which would require goingback up Alert Levels with associated economic and social costs.37 Given the lack of community transmission and rate of testing to date, Option Bhas been recommended by the Director-General in his interim advice.Timing of when a move to Alert Level 1 comes into effect38 The change to Alert Level could come into effect at either:38.1 11:59pm on Thursday 11 March; or657uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVE38.2 11:59pm on Friday 12 March.39 Options for timing are discussed below informed by the assessment of theoptions against the non- health measures that follows.Assessment of the proposed measures against the non-health factors40 I have assessed the proposed measures against the non-health factors agreedby Cabinet, as set out below.Economic impacts from Alert Levels41 There is considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the impact of the AlertLevel restrictions. Treasury last formally estimated the impacts of the AlertLevel restrictions in the HYEFU forecasts. However, the impact of therestrictions is likely to be smaller than previously estimated because:41.1 GDP data from the third quarter of 2020 shows that the economyperformed better than anticipated. This suggests that the impact ofhigher Alert Levels may be lower than previously thought, at least whenthere is significant fiscal support in place.41.2 Some proportion of the lost activity will also be made up later in the yearif the period of heightened Alert Level restrictions is relatively short.42 Allowing for the issues discussed above, the Treasury estimates theapproximate economic impacts of Auckland remaining in Alert Level 2 to bearound $50 million per week, or 1 percent of national GDP.43 It is also important to note that some of these GDP losses will occur evenwithout Alert Level restrictions, as people adjust their behaviour in response toperceived risk.44 At the same time, the impacts will differ across industries and within regions.For example, CBDs with more businesses that rely on foot traffic typicallyexperience larger declines in economic activity during lockdowns and a slowerrecovery. A further example is the loss of large events such as concerts andsports matches which are harder to defer. This makes the economic and socialbenefits from these events less likely to be delivered and they also feature “sunkcosts” from their preparation. These sectors are more likely to face longer termimpacts if consumer and business confidence falls due to uncertainty over thelikelihood and duration of future Alert Level restrictions.Impacts on at risk populations45 Providers and community groups advise that with the increased Alert Level inAuckland there was an increased demand for food, and increased levels ofanxiety and confusion, particularly around messaging of the Alert Levelmeasures.46 The Alert Level changes put increased pressure and challenges on many NewZealand communities. Given the impacts of COVID lockdowns are not always757uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVEimmediately experienced, cumulative community shocks could worsen overtime even if Auckland returned to Alert Level 1.47 Some additional funding was needed for providers to support vulnerablecommunities. Providers are now indicating this has positioned them well tosupport those in need of assistance.48 We also heard about the impact of COVID-19 on young people and over timewe expect to understand these impacts more fully.49 The Office of Ethnic Communities has sent out a COVID-19 survey for itsmandated communities asking about the impacts of COVID-19 on business andemployment, and seeks responses on the key concerns of ethnic communities.Public attitudes and compliance50 Social license remains crucial to a successful COVID-19 response. The publicreaction to individuals who did not use the COVID-19 Tracer app or otherwisefailed to follow good practices suggests a possible erosion of this. Furthererosion could undermine the overall response.51 Daily QR code poster scans have already started to decrease, with 454,254fewer scans on 9 March than on 8 March. I am awaiting advice from officials onoptions to increase scanning behaviours.52 If it is decided to move Auckland to Alert Level 1 and this is announced sometime ahead of it coming into effect our experience of moving down from AlertLevel 2 in other responses suggest many people will behave in accordance withthe Alert Level 1 rules before they take legal effect. Alternatively, keepingAuckland at Alert Level 2 is likely to see a further decline in compliance with theAlert Level settings. It would be difficult to regain the social licence for AlertLevel 2 restrictions for a prolonged period if the perceived risk of furthercommunity spread is low. And it appears many Aucklanders have alreadystarted to behave as if they have returned to Alert Level 1.Ability to operationalise the proposals in this paper53 We are well placed to implement the options in this paper as they involve thestatus quo or a return to Alert Level 1 nationally. However as noted in thepreceding section, there is likely to be increased non-compliance.Timing of when a move down Alert Level should come into effect54 If it is decided to move Auckland to Alert Level 1 there is a choice as to whento do so. On the one hand, a delay between the announcement and cominginto effect will potentially see large numbers of people behaving in accordancewith the Alert Level 1 rules ahead of them coming into effect.55 Based on the evidence available at 9:30am on Thursday 11 March 2021, theDirector-General’s interim advice is that there is no additional public health riskin the move to Alert Level 1 happening as early as 11:59pm Thursday 11 March.857uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVEAlert Level boundary56 There are no implications under either option for an Alert Level boundary. IfAuckland remained at Alert Level 2 there would continue to be an Alert Levelboundary but with no checkpoints as travel across the boundary is notprohibited.Retaining face coverings on public transport57 The current requirement for face coverings on public transport throughout NewZealand is an appropriate measure in response to the level of public health risk.I propose that we continue this measure to mitigate the risk of transmissionbetween passengers given physical distancing is difficult, with the sameexemptions as we have currently.Update on Communications58 In the last Cabinet paper, I noted challenges with our usual approach tocommunications. There were concerns about the effectiveness ofcommunications to Pacific, other ethnic and disabled communities – particularlyyouth – in relation to Alert Level settings.59 Officials are continuing to improve communications outreach, and are clarifyingthe roles, responsibilities and resourcing across Government for translation ofinformation, noting that accurate translation takes time. Ethnic communityleaders are interested in understanding how they can support the governmentto distribute key messages about the COVID-19 response and vaccine.60 The DPMC COVID-19 Group works with the Iwi Communications Collective toensure messages reach Māori partners and grass roots communities, andsupports iwi and Māori providers to develop resources that are tailoredspecifically for the needs of their communities.61 Specific initiatives are underway to improve engagement with a youngerdemographic. These include:61.1 The target demographic across Unite Against COVID-19 (UAC)channels was decreased from 18 to 15 years-old through all targetedpaid media, and Spotify was added as a key channel for youth;61.2 When the change from Alert Level 3 to 2 was announced, UAC used 20Auckland social media influencers to post a #stayinforit post thatencouraged younger audiences to stay in for the weekend (during AlertLevel 3). This included influencers in Māori, Pacific, Indian andyouth communities;61.3 The DPMC COVID-19 Group Engagement Team has worked with theMinistry of Education to establish a Zoom forum to have regularconnection with Auckland secondary schools head girls and boys. Workis also underway to engage with the National Māori Tertiary StudentsAssociation – Te Mana Akonga.957uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVE62 If Auckland moves to Alert Level 1, the All of Government daily messaging gridwill promote “Living at Alert Level 1” information available on the Unite AgainstCOVID-19 website in 25 languages, as well as translated information onthe Ministry of Pacific Peoples website and the Ministry of Pacific Peoples’Facebook page. The messaging goes to more than 350 communications andengagement contacts in central and local government, DHBs, businessassociations, regional and community groups, and is passed on to thousandsmore of their contacts.Economic support measures63 The Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSSMAR21) opened to receive applications onThursday 4 March, with payments being made from Monday 8 March.Following Cabinet’s previous decision to shift out of Alert Level 3, there will beno further round of applications from this resurgence.64 The Resurgence Support Payment (RSPMAR21) opened for applications on 8March and will close one month after a nationwide return to Alert Level 1. TheResurgence Support Payment for the February resurgence (RSPFEB21) willclose on Monday 22 March.65 For both RSP activations, as of 8 March around $100 million has been appliedfor, with nearly $68 million disbursed. Given it is early in the application windowfor the March payment, the vast majority of this is for the February payment.The fiscal costs will not be significantly affected by the decisions in this paper.66 Other support for businesses includes the Short-Term Absence Payment tohelp firms support eligible workers awaiting a COVID-19 test result, and theLeave Support Scheme to help firms to support workers instructed to self-isolate in relation to the COVID-19 response. These support measures areavailable at all Alert Levels.67 The Ministry of Social Development has seen an increase in the total numberof Short-Term Absence Payment applications over February 2021, with:67.1 a total of 87 applications by 12 February, with $31,000 paid toemployers;67.2 a total of 1,209 applications approved by 19 February, with $507,000paid to employers;67.3 a total 2,268 applications approved by 26 February, with $1.032 millionpaid to employers; and67.4 a total 4,416 applications approved by 5 March, with $2.021 million paidto employers.68 The number of Leave Support Scheme applications continues to increase –with 3,200 applications approved by 5 March 2021, and $19.772 million beingpaid out under this scheme.1057uww3fdkq 2021-03-22 14:31:19SENSITIVEFinancial Implications69 Relaxing Alert Level controls will improve economic activity as discussed aboveand this will impact on tax revenues.Legislative Implications70 I will make or amend an Order under section 11 of the COVID-19 Public HealthResponse Act 2020 informed by Cabinet’s decision.71 Before making a replacement Order or amending an Order, I must have regardto any advice from the Director-General about the risks of the outbreak orspread of COVID-19, and the nature and extent of any measures that areappropriate to address those risks. I may also have regard to Cabinet’s decisionon the level of public health measures appropriate to respond to those risks andavoid, mitigate, or remedy the effects of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19.72 Additionally, Ministerial consultation requirements will be satisfied throughprevious consultation on template Orders for Alert Level requirements and theproposals outlined in this paper.73 The Act requires that there be 48 hours between publishing the Order and itscoming into force. This requirement does not apply when an Order onlyremoves or reduces requirements. Any decisions to add requirements beyondthe current template orders will take more time.Impact Analysis74 The Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in this paper areexempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS)because they are intended to alleviate the short-term impacts of a declaredemergency event of COVID-19 outbreak. These proposals are requiredurgently to be effective, making a complete, robust and timely impact analysisunfeasible.Human Rights75 The human rights implications of controls to slow the spread of COVID-19 aresignificant and have been set out in detail in previous papers on Alert Leveldecisions [CAB-20-MIN-0161 and CAB-20-MIN-0176 refer].76 Relevant departments and the Solicitor-General will continue to keep anyremaining restrictive measures under review to ensure that they remainnecessary and are implemented in a way that is consistent with the NewZealand Bill of Rights Act.Population impacts77 Population impacts are discussed in paragraphs 46-50.Consultation78 This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group in the Department of thePrime Minister and Cabinet.

The person providing the childcare needs to form a shared bubble with the personwho is working.Parliamentary Services:yThis amendment clarifies that the order does not apply to:• MPs and Parliamentary Staff and officers of parliament (because the Act prevents thelclosure of parliament). e• Ministers of the Crown and the Ministerial staff in relation to government business.v48 Hour Notification Period Not RequiredThe Act requires that a COVID-19 order must be published a gazetted at least 48 hours before iticomes into force. However, this notice period is not required to be observed where the Minister istsatisfied that the order should come into force urgently to prevent or contain the outbreak or spreadcof COVID-19 or the effect of the order is only to remove or reduce requirements imposed by aCOVID-19 order.aIn this instance, officials advise that the amendments to meet this threshold as the use of facecoverings is required urgently in order to contain the spread of COVID-19 by limitingtransmoission. Other amendments to the order are considered a reduction of requirements imposedby the order.rConsultationThe consultation required under the Act took place on the basis of the advice received and agreed toPbyMinisters this morning [CVD-21-MIN-0003].Crown Law have also reviewed the proposed order.Public Health AdvicePublic Health advice regarding mandating the use of face coverings was considered by Ministers thismorning [CVD-21-MIN-0003].Public health have advised that the proposed amendment to allow for the provision of childcare isacceptable as long as the bubble is exclusive of no more than 2 bubbles joining and as longas standard public health advice is applied (i.e. to stay home if symptomatic, if have been at alocation of interest, or they are a contact of a case).New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990s9(2)(h)"

However, this is only extended for the purposes of people travelling by airfrom Queenstown or travelling on a Cook Strait ferry, as these halve been identified as havingcapacity issues over the initial 48-hour period. e• The period will be initially extended for 24 hours, but we are advised that it may beextended further if required. This will require a further aRmendment to the order.Quality Assurance and Proof-Reading Changes:• Because of the speed required to bring the principal order into force, PCO’s qualityassurance and proof-reading processesy had to be abridged.

The order has been provided to you directly from PCO.eHigh Level Summary of the Amendment OrdersCare of Children of AL4 WorkersCl 16(ia) refers to “shared bubble arrangements” in the context of childcare arrangeaments. However,what is meant by that term in this context is not entirely consistent with the definition of that termin the order. Accordingly, this clause will be clarified so that it instead appliees in respect of AL4business and services workers who have to leave their home or place of residence to work and haveno fellow resident nor anyone in a shared bubble arrangement who is able to provide childcare. Itlwill then require the carer to provide care to no other person and teo act as if they are in a sharedbubble arrangement with the person for whom they are providing care.RAdditionally, this clause will also be amended to apply in reverse – i.e. also allowing the person whorequires childcare to travel to the home of the childcare provider in order to drop off and pick uptheir children.These amendments allow childcare arrangemenyts to be achieved both within families, and usingarrangements such as the Ministry of Education’s Emergency Childcare Scheme, which we areladvised was approved by Cabinet this morning. However, it would require the use of only oneechildcare provider per bubble/shared bubble and would require all parties to act as if they were in ashared bubble arrangement with the others.vLicensing trustsiThe order amends this item in the list of AL4 Business and Services to clarify that only the off-licensetbottle store functions of licensing trusts are included. This prevents licensing trusts operating on-clicense services.Uncooked fooad delivery services and cooked food delivery servicesThe order amends this item in the list of AL4 Business and Services to clarify that there is aodistinction between:r1. Uncooked food delivery services (which is uncaveated); andP2. Cooked food delivery services, which is subject to the caveat that the services must be referredby the Ministry of Social Development, a District Health Board or the Accident CompensationCorporation (for example, Meals on Wheels)The amendment also clarifies that bakeries and suppliers of alcohol are included within the“uncooked food delivery services” category.Essential non-food consumer productsThis amendment brings the order into line with the MBIE Guidance that was published yesterdayand approved by Ministers last night.Businesses or services necessary to maintain other alert level 4 businesses or servicesThe order amends this item in the list of AL4 Business and Services to include both alert level 4businesses or services, and other exempt businesses and services. This amendment corrects anoversight, which meant that there was no equivalent to the existing provision to allow for businessor services to operate in support of exempted Services under cl 23 (for example, the ParliamentarydCounsel Office operating in support of Parliament).eUnionsThe order amends the list of AL4 Business and Services to include an additional item to cosver unions,where reasonably necessary to enable the union to provide a service and the service cannotreasonably be delayed (for example, because a delay would risk the health and safeaty of workers).This appears to have been an oversight for inclusion in this order, and is consistent with previousalert level 3 and 4 settings. el48 Hour Notification PeriodeThe COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 (the Act) requires that a COVID-19 order must bepublished a gazetted at least 48 hours before it comes into force. However, this notice period is notRrequired to be observed where the Minister is satisfied that the order should come into forceurgently to prevent or contain the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 or where the effect of the orderis only to remove or reduce requirements imposed by a COVID-19 order.In this instance, amendments to the order eitheyr clarify existing settings, are a reduction ofotherwise applicable requirements, or are urgently required in order to deal with the outbreak.Accordingly, we consider that the 48-hourl notice period need not be observed in this case.eConsultationThe Act requires that before mavking a COVID-19 order, you consult with the Prime Minister, theMinister of Justice, and the Minister of Health.iYour office kindly facilittated consultation with the relevant Minister’s offices on the basis of asummary of the amcendments earlier today.

The Ministryof Health has provided specific advice on the amendment to clause 16 for the purposes of childcare,and confirms that this amendment is consistent with their public health advice with regard to AL4settings.

Ipropose keeping all of New Zealand at Alert Level 4 with another review onsMonday 23 August.aRelationship with Government priorities2 This paper concerns the Government’s response to COVID-19.eSummaryl3 Following the decision to move Auckland and Coromandel to Alert Level 4 untile11.59pm on 24 August and the rest of New Zealand to Alert Level 4 until11.59pm on 20 August 2021, a decision is required about the approach for theRrest of New Zealand for the next period.4 As at 9am on Friday 20 August, 30 community cases have been detected thatare linked to the Auckland outbreak. There are 28 cases within Auckland andytwo within Wellington. The index case of the Auckland community outbreakremains unknown and source investigation is ongoing. Based on WholelGenome Sequencing (WGS), it is strongly suspected that the infectioneoriginated from a person who arrived on a flight from New South Wales on7 August.v5 Our rapid move to Alert Level 4 was based on the threat posed by the Deltaivariant and how little we knew about the index case. While we now know more,tthere remain many unknowns including the total number of contacts andcoutstanding test results. Accordingly, a precautionary approach remainsappropriate.a6 The paper recommends New Zealand remain at Alert Level 4 with a review onoMonday, 23 August 2021. Remaining at Alert Level 4 is consistent with theDirector-General of Health’s advice.r7The Director-General of Health advises that while testing and contact tracingPare progressing well, it will take some time for a full picture to emerge. Atpresent, there are not yet enough testing and wastewater results to support aconclusion that the current outbreak is under control. He therefore advises thathe cannot recommend a reduction in Alert Levels for Auckland, Coromandel,and the rest of New Zealand at this time. He recommends Auckland stay atAlert Level 4 for a further seven days with a review on Monday 30 August; andthat Coromandel, and the rest of New Zealand should stay at Alert Level 4 until11.59pm on Tuesday 24 August, with a review on Monday 23 August.19xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVE8 Although not recommended at this time, it is timely to consider how we couldkeep Auckland, and the Coromandel, at Alert Level 4 and move the rest of thecountry to Alert Level 3. In terms of an Alert Level boundary, an option isattached as Appendix 1. We would also need to decide what categories ofworkers would be permitted to travel across the boundary. Narrow permissionswould minimise risk of transmission but result in large numbers of exemption drequests to the Director-General of Health, creating a significant administrativeburden. Operationalising such a boundary is a huge challenge and officialse arecontinuing work on how best to do this and are consulting iwi and localstakeholders.sHow we make Alert Level decisionsa9 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand: e9.1 the Director-General of Health’s satisfaction on four health matters:l9.1.1 the source of the case(s) or outbereak (noting new variants ofconcern), and the number and geographical distribution ofclusters; R9.1.2 the length of time the virus has been in the community and thepotential for undetect ed transmission (i.e. between the sourceand the case); y9.1.3 the containment of the case(s) and/or cluster(s), includinglconsideratioen of the potential for undetected communitytransmission occurring in New Zealand or in quarantine-freetravel countries;v9.1.4 the capacity and capability of our public health systems,iincludingour surveillance and contact tracing systems;tc9.2 evidence of the effects of the measures on the economy and societymore broadly;a9.3 evidence of the impacts of the measures for at risk populations ino particular;r9.4 public attitudes towards the measures and the extent to which peopleand businesses understand, accept, and abide by them; andP9.5 our ability to operationalise the restrictions, including satisfactoryimplementation planning [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer].10 In line with our resurgence response plan, in determining what measures andcontrols should be in place after the immediate response phase, we areparticularly interested in:10.1 the connection of cases to a known source at the border;10.2 the number of cases and close contacts; and29xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVE10.3 the geographic spread of cases, including across regions.The current response11 At 11.59pm on Tuesday 17 August 2021, all of New Zealand moved to AlertLevel 4. Auckland and the Coromandel will remain at Alert Level 4 for an initialdperiod of 7 days, with the rest of New Zealand at Alert Level 4 for at least 3days until 11.59pm on 20 August [CAB-21-MIN-0324 refers].eSituation reports12 As at 9am on Friday 20 August, there have been 30 community cases detected:a12.1 14 cases have been epidemiologically linked to the initial cluster;12.2 eight cases are not yet formally linked to the inietial cluster but initialinterviews strongly suggest an epidemiological link;l12.3 one case is border related, being an international flight crew membereidentified through routine surveillance testing, and most likely unrelatedto the community clusterR12.4 there are two cases linked to the initial cluster who are currently inhospital;y12.5 seven community cases have been detected overnight in Auckland andtwo in Wellington that have yet to be interviewed; andle12.6 WGS results for Cases B - G are all the same, and suggest a single chainof transmission, with all cases linked with Case A.v13 Modelling by Te Pūnaha Matatini suggests that there were likely to be asignificant numiber of undetected cases in the community prior to 17 August.Their modellting simulates multiple transmission scenarios, and the resultssuggest ac plausible range for cumulative community cases at the point ofdetection of between approximately 25 and 150 cases. Based on testing ratesin thae community, and the likelihood of detecting each case, the modellingsuggests that the initial seeding event is likely to have occurred 10 to15 daysoprior to detection of the initial case. The fact that multiple cases have beenfound quickly after the initial case was detected confirms that we are in ascenario where there was the potential for significant community spread priorrtothe introduction of Alert Level 4.1PDirector-Generalof Health’s interim assessment against the health factorsSource of the case(s)/outbreak14 The index case of the Auckland Community Outbreak remains unknown andsource investigation is ongoing. However, based on WGS results it is strongly1 The modelling results have been provided to the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Adviser and theDirector-General of Health. I understand the modelling has informed the overall public health riskassessment of the current outbreak.39xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVEsuspected that the infection originated from an infected person who arrivedfrom New South Wales on 7 August and who was in managed isolation.15 To date, we have formally identified over 1,000 contacts associated withknown clusters and this number is likely to increase significantly over the next24 hours as we receive and upload details of pupils from several schools and dlarge events such as church services (between 5-8,000 contacts expected tobe added to the system today). This number does not include the staffe andpatients tested at Auckland Hospital in response to a staff member workingthere while potentially infectious.sLength of time the virus has been in the communitya16 Based on the probable link to the case in managed isolation, who arrived inNew Zealand late on 7 August, the virus may have been in the community foreup to 10 days before Alert Level 4 was implemented. WGS results suggest justone to two steps in the chain of transmission before the first case was identified.lePotential for undetected community transmission17 The Director-General of Health advises that Rhe cannot rule out the possibility ofwider community transmission beyond the cases we have identified to date inAuckland and Wellington.Health system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systemsy18 In terms of assessing against our overall criteria for moving down alert levels,testing, contact tracing, bolrder controls, and health and disability systemecapacity are considered robust. However, we are still awaiting swab test results,including a large number taken on 19 August and still being processed, acrossmany areas of New vZealand.19 There are curriently two cases from the community outbreak in hospital withCOVID-19. tc20 The is no evidence to indicate a lack of confidence in the capacity of the healthsysteam. There are seasonal pressures on the system with winter illnesses, inparticular RSV.o21 The Ministry of Health holds supply for 12 weeks consumption at estimatedpandemic level. In recent weeks assurance has been sought from the sectorrthatthey hold sufficient contingency supply of PPE for 1-2 weeks and askedP that they place orders to boost their contingency supply where necessary.Orders for PPE are currently being reviewed and approved on a twice dailybasis and the Ministry considers that the health and disability sector is wellprepared with supplies of PPE. Demand for N95/P2 particulate respirators andassociated protective eyewear has increased as a result of updates to InfectionPrevention and Control guidance. Supply is able to absorb this increase andthe Ministry will place further orders for supplies accordingly. As at 20 August2021, there are currently 564,500 swabs in supply and 100,000 that are due toarrive next week with further forward orders arriving at the end of August 2021.Based on the number of swabs taken this week, the current stock level will49xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVEprovide for nine weeks of supply. Orders for laboratory consumables tomaintain core laboratory service use of blood tests have been expedited22 As of 20 August 2021, approximately 68,000 swabs have been undertaken overthe five days since the first case was identified. This includes nearly 28,000 testresults processed on Thursday 19 August. d23 Laboratories are processing tests within the required timeframes. One19 August, 6,148 tests were processed in the Auckland region and about 2000tests were taken from the Waikato region, including Coromandel. 41,760 testsswere processed over the previous 7 days.a24 A wastewater sample from Rosedale, s9(2)(a)was taken on Monday 16 August and returned a detection of COVID-19 on19 August. Samples taken from the Western and Easetern Interceptors on16 August have also returned detections of COVID-19.l25 The Ministry of Health is confident that the capacitey and capability of its contacttracing system is sufficient. The NITC has activated the Health SystemResponse surge to be on standby if requiRred for assistance. The NITC hasactivated the full Public Health Unit (PHU) ready capacity and they are onstandby to activate their surge capacity if required. Contact tracing activitiesincluding management of exposure events and symptomatic contacts will bedelegated to PHUs across the cyountry to support Auckland Regional PublicHealth Service who are managing the identified cases.l26 As of today there are 2,96e2,439 registered NZ COVID Tracer app users.Proposalv27 Based on information to hand, the situation suggests the country should remainat Alert Level 4i. The Director-General of Health advises that while testing andtcontact tracing are progressing well, it will take some time for a full picture tocemerge. At present, there are not yet enough testing and wastewater results tosupport a conclusion that the current outbreak is under control. He thereforeaadvises he cannot recommend a reduction in Alert Levels for Auckland,Coromandel and the rest of New Zealand at this time.o28 Based on the most recent public health risk assessment, the Director-General’sradvice is that Auckland’s Alert Level should be reviewed on 30 August 2021,with Coromandel, and the Alert Level for the rest of New Zealand reviewed onP23 August 2021.29 Keeping all New Zealand at Alert Level 4 is a precautionary approach. Itresponds to the higher transmissibility of the Delta variant and reflects the factthat there is insufficient information available to be confident that there is notransmission elsewhere. It maintains our precautionary approach while givingus more time to fully understand the extent of the outbreak.30 I therefore propose all New Zealand remains at Alert Level 4 and that this bereviewed on Monday 23 August 2021.59xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVE35.1 Our infection and death rates are among the lowest in the world, and wedon’t risk people not being able to work due to the effects of long-COVID;a healthy population supports the economy.35.2 Our unemployment rate is already back at its pre-COVID level of 4%because we protected jobs and businesses with the wage subsidy. dUnemployment peaked at only 5.3%, compared to countries like the USand Canada which rose above 10%. e35.3 Our economy is now bigger than it was before COVID. The latest GDPsdata shows activity in the March 2021 quarter 2.4% above what it was ayear ago. Across the OECD group of 38 advanced economies activity inathe same period remained 0.8% below last year.35.4 The Government is in a strong financial position; eNet core Crown debtstood at 31.2% of GDP at the end of May 2021 compared to forecastsat Budget 2020 for it to be about 44% of l GDP at 30 June 2021. Ifdebt were 44% at 30 June 2021 this would erepresent about $40 billion inadditional nominal core Crown debt. Thisgives us options to keep investingR to protect New Zealanders andaccelerate our recovery.Impacts on at risk populationsy36 The impacts of Alert Level 4 are amplified as the period we remain in Alert Levelendures. Although higher Alert Levels assist in preventing communityltransmission in communities that are more vulnerable, they disproportionatelyeimpact some groups especially those living in Auckland (which a high proportionof many at risk populations do). Restrictions on earning and movement canvintensify income and poverty inequities, impact the accessibility of testing sitesand to essential services, increase the digital divide and access to keyiinformation, and increase anxiety. Tailored communication and engagement istimportant across all groups.c37 The impacts on at risk populations are discussed more in Appendix 5.aPublic attitudes and complianceo38 Initial campaign messaging has focused on ensuring people have the keyinformation they need to conform to the Alert Level 4 requirements. Vaccinermessages are being integrated from 19 August, within main messages and alsoP with a standalone vaccine ad.39 On the Unite Against COVID-19 social channels since the 17 August, contenthas reached 4.1 million people. Sentiment is overall supportive of the lockdownand anxiety levels do not appear to be too high. For the period 12pm – 11:59pmAugust 17 the most frequently asked questions were about rules for travel(26%) and the alert level change (25%). There are questions about vaccineappointments (20%) and people are asking about the current case, locations ofinterest and the variant (14%). The Unite Against COVID-19 website had 1.35million page views on 17 August 2021, with sustained high web traffic over the79xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVElast 24 hours. The website has information translated in 27 different languagesincluding NZSL.40 Social licence remains crucial to a successful COVID-19 response and ourmessaging will be informed by the sentiment we are seeing through ourchannels and insights reports. Pulse check research is being undertaken dcurrently to understand where current sentiment and compliance is sitting.e41 Data provided by Google has indicated there have been a large number ofsearches over the last two days (COVID-19, Locations of Interest, COVID App, ,sTesting) with some shifts in the themes on 18 August with Wage Subsidy (i.e.resurgence payments) trending and a rise in the number of queries foraLockdown. Anti-lockdown protest was also noted as a rising term.42 Police have dealt with three different protests in Auckeland, Tauranga andNelson. Police have a low tolerance of unlawful gatherings and the public canexpect that they will look to enforce the current restrlictions in place under AlertLevel 4. Police arrested eight people in relation eto breaches of Alert Level 4following protests in Auckland’s CBD and outside Tauranga Police Station on18 August. Police are urging everyone to sRtay at home and it will continue towork with its partners and the public to ensure everyone complies with therestrictions in place under Alert Level 4. The vast majority of New Zealandersare doing the right thing and abiding by the Alert Level restrictions, and theseprotestors represent a very small ynumber of people who are not.Ability to operationalise the proposalls in this papere43 If the whole country remains at Alert Level 4 there are no additional operationalchallenges to what we face currently.vAlert Level 4 settingsi44 The same settings will be retained for essential personal movement and AlerttLevel 4 businesses and services as are included in the current Alert Level 4cOrder. This will mean the vaccine rollout can continue as planned.a45 I note that the Director-General of Health has granted exemptions to the currentAlert Level 4 Order for education institutions to provide resources for students,otertiaryhostels to provide food and beverages on site, banks and non-bankfinancial institutions to provide essential services that cannot be done virtually,rfor the supply of food and other essentials (for example, nappies) at airportsP and for the Paralympians to travel domestically on their way to Tokyo. Each ofthese exemptions is assessed in terms of both the specific risk associated withthe individual exemption and the overall contribution to cumulative COVID-19risk.Essential non-food consumer products46 At Alert Level 4, the provision of “essential non-food consumer products” is anAlert Level 4 business or service. During the previous Alert Level 4, in 2020,there was no prescriptive list provided. Instead, MBIE provided generalprinciples as guidance to determine whether goods were “essential consumer89xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVEproducts”. These were products that enable people to: safely isolate; stayconnected to one another; and work or study from home. Following feedbackfrom businesses, MBIE have provided guidance on the nature and scope ofactivity allowed under this provision during the current Alert Level 4 period.47 I will amend the COVID-19 Order to define essential non-food consumer dproducts in line with the guidance. Further amendments can be made to theCOVID-19 Order in the future to reflect updated views on what essential goeodsshould be. More detail about the guidance is provided in Appendix 4.sEconomic support measures48 The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) advise they area continuing tomonitor the social impacts of any change in Alert Levels, and any additionalsupport that might be required for people and communities. The followingewelfare supports are currently available:l48.1 People can seek support from MSD via phone or online to help with foodecosts; accommodation costs; power, gas, heating or water bills; medicaland dental costs.R48.2 The Wage Subsidy Scheme August 2021 helps eligible businesses(including those who are self-employed) to continue paying employeesand retain them for the period of the subsidy. The subsidy will pay $600yfor full-time employees and $359 for part-time employees andapplications can be made from 20 August. The Scheme is open for 2lweeks.e48.3 The Leave Support Scheme provides businesses with a two-week lumpsum paymentv of either $600 per week for full-time employees or $359per week for part-time workers who must self-isolate and can’t work fromhome, oir who need to self-isolate due to family members etc. Employerstcannot get the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy August 2021 and LeaveSupcport Scheme simultaneously for the same employee. Paymentincreases will not take effect until 24 August.a48.4 The Short-Term Absence Payment (STAP) provides businesses with ao one-off (once per 30 days) payment of $359 for employees who mustmiss work due to a COVID-19 test and cannot work from home. STAPpayments can be made more than once in a 30 day period under certainrcircumstances (which could apply during this lockdown. PaymentPincreases will not take effect until 24 August.48.5 Social and community-based services will continue to provide support toNew Zealanders. MSD has provided additional advice to providers aboutwho can operate – social services that provide and support a place forsomeone to live; social services that support disabled people to maintaincritical wellbeing; and crisis support for people who are unsafe.99xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVEConsiderations for a future move of part of the country to Alert Level 349 While moving some parts of New Zealand to Alert Level 3 at this time wasconsidered, I do not recommend this option in light of the public health riskdiscussed above. However, in preparation for a possible move down AlertLevels in the future, it is timely to consider how we could keep move the rest ofdthe country to Alert Level 3 if we were confident community transmission wascontained beyond Auckland, and the Coromandel (which could remain at AlerteLevel 4). We are familiar with boundaries around Auckland but if theCoromandel was also kept at Alert level 4, a new boundary would be required.sAlert Level 4/3 boundarya50 My officials have developed an Alert Level boundary option that includes all ofthe Auckland region, parts of the northern Waikato (excluding Hamilton) andethe Coromandel peninsula. A map of this is attached as Appendix 1. Theboundary has been located to minimise the number of communities that AlertLevel 4 applies to. It also seeks to minimise the nulmber of people needing toetravel across it to access life critical services (e.g. health care andsupermarkets) and get to workplaces if they are able to work. I note, however,that given an Alert Level boundary is about rRestricting movement to reduce riskof transmission, it will still cause significant economic and social disruption. It islikely exemptions would be need for workers at various dairy and meatcompanies that would normally cross the boundary to get to work.y51 Enforcement of such a lengthy boundary will also be challenging for Police, whowill need to redirect resourcles to establish the necessary checkpoints. Therehas been some consultateion with local councils and iwi about the proposedboundary that will be taken into consideration if we did implement an Alert Level4/3 boundary. Obviovusly the more time agencies have to operationalise an AlertLevel boundary the better. In addition to Police setting up checkpoints, MBIEhaving time to istand up the business travel register so that workers permittedto cross the btoundary can obtain a document that can be used as evidence oftheir permcission to travel will make transiting checkpoints much more efficient.Agencies are progressing work as a priority on how an Alert Level 4/3 boundarywoulad be operationalised and I will update Cabinet on this work in the next AlertLevel review paper.o52 I also note Northland could be included in the Alert Level 4 area. This wouldresolve some issues with previous Alert Level 3/2 Auckland boundaries whererpeopleneeded to travel between Alert Level areas to access workplaces,P schools and life critical services. It would also protect vulnerable communitiesin Northland if there were undetected community transmission. However, wewould be trading off ease of worker and community movements againstconstraining economic activity.Permitted purposes for workers to travel between Alert Level areas53 In December 2021 Cabinet noted a set of principles that would guide decision-making for permitted movement across an Alert Level 3/2 boundary. Theseprinciples could also apply to movement across an Alert Level 4/3 boundary.109xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVE54 While noting the primacy of public health objectives, the principles strike abalance between limiting the spread of the virus and the economic and socialcosts. As with all restrictions under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act2020, restrictions on movement must be proportionate to the public health risk[CBC-20-MIN-0122 refers].d55 In relation to permitted movement over Alert Level boundaries Cabinet also:e55.1 noted the following three categories of movement:s55.1.1 Category 1 – movement that would be permitted under allcircumstances, e.g. border services, emergency services andahealthcare workers and all freight is always permitted;55.1.2 Category 2 – movement likely to be permietted, but for which anassessment would be required in each resurgence, e.g. rail androad construction; and le55.1.3 Category 3 – all other movement may be allowed by specificexemption issued by the Director-General of Health; andR55.2 agreed what businesses and services were in Category 2.356 If an Alert Level 4/3 boundary was imposed in the future, it could be appropriateythat no Category 2 businesses and services be permitted to travel across theboundary. This would be justified by the higher risk of undetected communityltransmission in an Alert Level 4 area. Although this will disrupt some supplyechains, all freight can move across the boundary and other movement can bepermitted by an exemption from the Director-General of Health. Allowing suchvmovement by exemption has the advantage that the Director-General canimpose specific conditions to mitigate risks.it57 There is, however, no question this will create significant operational challengescand a large administrative burden processing exemption applications.aAdditional face covering and record keeping requirementsMandatory use of face coveringso58 When the country moves to lower Alert Levels, I propose to implement thermandatory face covering requirements Cabinet agreed to on 16 August 2021P [CAB-21-MIN-0315 refers]. Bringing these new requirements into effect nowmakes sense. When used in combination with other public health measures(including record keeping), face coverings strengthen our response tocommunity outbreaks.59 The new mandatory face covering requirements at Alert Level 2 and 3 could beannounced following today’s meeting. They would come into effect immediatelyif we move to the lower Alert Levels where they apply. I consider thisimplementation timing appropriate because New Zealanders are better3 A full list of Category 2 businesses and services is attached as Appendix 1.119xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVEpractised at wearing face coverings now, and the definition of face covering isbroad enough to avoid people needing to go out and purchase masks tocomply.Mandatory record keepingd60 I also propose to implement the mandatory record keeping requirementsCabinet agreed to on 16 August 2021, when the country moves down AlerteLevels [CAB-21-MIN-0315 refers]. Good record keeping supports fastercommunication with those who are identified as contacts of a positive case. Itsis another public health measure we can use to help to contain an outbreak.a61 The obligation for these mandatory record keeping requirements would beborne by the person responsible for a place or gathering. These people will berequired to have systems and processes in place to eensure, so far as isreasonably practicable, that people scan the QR code for the place or gatheringor provide details in a contact tracing record. New Zlealanders also need timeto understand where and when record keeping wiell be mandated.62 The timing of when the new record keepinRg requirements come into effect isimportant for these reasons. My officials consulted with Business New Zealand,Restaurant Association New Zealand and Hospitality New Zealand ontimeframes to bring the new record keeping requirements into effect. On thebasis of this consultation, I proypose the record keeping requirements areannounced after this meeting but will not come into effect for seven days aftera shift in Alert Levels. le63 This implementation timing will ensure people responsible for places andgatherings prepare to have appropriate record keeping systems and processesvin place (where they do not already). Employers will have time to provide anytraining to staff on use of new systems and processes, and update seven-dayiworking rostetrs to support this. Officials will have time to prepare guidance onthese requirements, including relating to privacy protections and employmentcrelations issues.aFinancial Implications64 oThe Minister of Finance will provide advice on the Wage Subsidy andResurgence Support Payment financial implications separately to Ministers.rLegislativeImplicationsP65If the decision is for all New Zealand to stay at Alert Level 4, there are nolegislative implications. The current Order under section 11 of the COVID-19Public Health Response Act 2020 will simply remain in place.Impact Analysis66 The Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in this paper areexempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statementbecause they are intended to alleviate the short-term impacts of a declaredemergency event of COVID-19 outbreak.

GDP rose 14% inthe September quarter after an 11% drop in the June 2020 quarter. By theeMarch 2021 quarter, economic activity in New Zealand was 2.4% above whereit was a year ago. This compared to Australia’s economy being 1.1% abovewhere it was in March 2020, the US 0.4% above, the Euro area besing down1.3%, the UK down 6.1%, with the average across the OECD being down 0.8%,aaccording to Stats NZ.2 Data show the strength in activity in the March 2021 quarter compared to Marche2020 was broad-based. Activity was stronger in: Agriculture, forestry andfishing, Manufacturing, retail trade and accommodation, wholesale trade,lconstruction, education and training, and the arts and recreation industries,eamong others. Figure 1 tracks the New Zealand Activity Index and GDP dataon a quarterly basis:Rylevitcaor3 Unemployment in New Zealand peaked at 5.3% in the September 2020 quarter(the same as it was in December 2016), despite forecasts that it would hit 10%Pdue to COVID-19, as seen in countries like the US and Canada during thepandemic. By mid-2021 the unemployment rate had fallen back to its pre-COVID level of 4%. About 63,000 more people were in work during the June2021 quarter than pre-COVD. Between 1 January 2021 and 31 July 2021,74,919 people exited a main benefit to enter employment, according to MSDdata.4 The stronger economy has supported the Government’s fiscal position.

Whānau Ora CommsissioningAgencies are currently responding to requests for meeting essentials. Te PuniKōkiri advise the priorities for Māori wellbeing being reported bya the communityare currently food, vaccinations and testing.ePacific Peoples3 A significant proportion of the Pacific population livling in New Zealand live inthe Auckland region, where the current outbreake is. Higher Alert Levels (i.e.Alert Level 3 and 4) impact the Pacific population in the following ways:R3.1 restrictions on earning capacity flowing from Alert Level shifts amplifyincome and poverty inequities;3.2 restrictions on movement p ositively assist in preventing COVID-19entering the Pacific community. This is critical considering the high riskyof rapid transmission presented by household overcrowding and otherpractices that bring Pacific peoples together frequently (e.g.lchurch/faith-basede gatherings).3.3 preventing the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the community is alsoimportant fovr Pacific peoples because they tend to have poor healthoutcomes and high rates of comorbidities.i4 Ensuring we have the right Alert Levels in place is crucial for Pacifictcommunities as they are more susceptible to the worst effects of COVID-19.cDisabled Peoplea5 The Office for Disability Issues has advised that key issues identified by theDisabled Peoples Organisations relating to Alert Level changes include:o5.1Accessibility of testing sites. COVID-19 testing sites are stood uprapidly and some are more accessible than others. Accessible sitesrshould be well-publicised and prioritisation opportunities could bePconsidered.5.2 Accessibility to essential services. There has been strongcommunications that people must, for example, shop at supermarketsalone at higher Alert Levels. It is also now mandatory to wear a facecovering while inside a supermarket. Notwithstanding face coveringexemptions, some disabled people who rely on buddy shoppers do nothave access to supermarket shopping as a result.5.3 Face coverings for disabled people. The mandatory face coveringrequirements have been strongly communicated. There should bestronger communication about exemption options.229xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVE5.4 Communication. The ongoing importance of communications inalternative formats was emphasised. Ongoing consideration of digitalconnectivity was also promoted.Ethnic Communities6 New Zealand’s ethnic communities make up roughly 20% of the population. dAbout 60% of people from these communities live in Auckland. Small businessowners will be highly impacted by the lockdown, particularly hospietalitybusinesses.7 Digital connectedness is also a challenge experienced by somse ethniccommunity members, and a percentage of ethnic community members do notunderstand English. This combination of factors leaves ethnaic communitieshighly socially vulnerable in the context of COVID-19, particularly if they do notlive with whānau as part of their bubble under Level 4. eLow income householdsl8 Since the move to Alert Level 4, social and community-based services haveebeen clear about who provides services and how to do this within the requiredsettings and public health requirements.R9 Whilst there has been increased demand, particularly for foodbanks, there isconsistent feedback (predominantly from outside of Auckland), that people arenot too concerned about coping long term, as post Friday they are anticipatingythis to be an Auckland Regional issue only.l10 If there is an extension at level 4 or a change to 3 in some areas we wouldeexpect to see a change in the level of concern, the way communities want torespond and the requests for funding, particularly in relation to food and PPE.vThis is predominantly because of the nature of communities in that they willwant to mobilise and be out and about supporting their most vulnerable. Thereiis a risk that this will drive a level of movement in communities that is countertto the overarching need to minimise movement. MSD would continue to workcwith communities and provide consistent messaging about the supports alreadyin place and the need to utilise existing channels.aOlder peopleo11 Most older people are likely to be able to cope for a short Alert Level 4 lockdown. Organisations supporting older people have used their experience fromrlastyear to be able to quickly set up and operate/provide servicesPremotely. Issues that will impact for a longer period of lockdown include:11.1 Bill paying – some people still pay bills in person and will be impactedby the lockdown and not being able to pay their essential service bills(power, telephone etc).11.2 Accessing services that are on line – this impacts on people who aredigitally excluded for whatever reason – for older people digitalexclusion increases with age.11.3 Food delivery services – with lockdown older people are encouraged toget others to do their shopping – this becomes problematic if they can’t239xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SENSITIVEgo online or aren’t able to get someone to assist them – sometimespayment becomes an issue (access to cash).11.4 We also note that there is ongoing anxiety over COVID and itsimpacts. This anxiety has been heightened with the more virulent Deltavariant now in the community. While many older people aredvaccinated, there are many still waiting and who are not able to getappointments due to availability or prioritisation.eYoung peoples12 In relation to youth, we have seen through Youthline, a significant surge insupport being sought, even at this early stage. aeleRylevitcaorP249xf54yo3ur 2021-10-27 13:55:52SE NS I TIV ECAB-21-MIN-0330CabinetMinute of DecisiondThis document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

However, this notice period is notarequired to be observed where the Minister is satisfied that the order should come into forceurgently to prevent or contain the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 or where the effect of the orderois only to remove or reduce requirements imposed by a COVID-19 order.rIn this instance, amendments to the order either clarify existing settings, are a reduction ofotherwise applicable requirements, or are urgently required in order to deal with the outbreak.PAccordingly,we consider that the 48-hour notice period need not be observed in this case.ConsultationThe Act requires that before making a COVID-19 order, you consult with the Prime Minister, theMinister of Justice, and the Minister of Health.Your office kindly facilitated consultation with the relevant Ministers’ offices on the basis of asummary of the amendments earlier today. Accordingly, this requirement has been complied with.Public Health AdviceThe Act requires that before making a COVID-19 order, you must have had regard to advice from theDirector-General of Health about the risks of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 and the nature andextent of measures (whether voluntary or enforceable) that are appropriate to address thoserisks. You are not required to receive specific advice from the Director-General about the content ofa proposed order or proposal to amend, extend or revoke an order.dThese amendments are consistent with public health advice that has been provided previously orotherwise clarify the settings upon which public health advice has already been given. The Minisetryof Health has reviewed the specific proposals and has no concerns. Accordingly, we advise that youhave received sufficient advice on these matters so as to be able to have regard to the DirectorsGeneral’s advice on Alert Level four settings generally, as required.aNew Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990A matter for you to consider each time an order is proposed is whether the exercise of such powerswill be appropriate. The power to make an order under section 11 of the Acte must be exercisedconsistently with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA).s9(2)(h)leRylevitcaorP"

At 11.59pm, Tuesday 17 August, all New Zealand moved to AlertRLevel 4 [CAB-21-MIN-0324 refers]. On Friday 20 August, Cabinet agreed tokeep all New Zealand at Alert Level 4 until at least 11.59pm, Tuesday 24 August[CAB-21-MIN-0330 refers].y5 There are 107 cases as at 09.00am, Monday 23 August. With Alert Level 4 inplace from 11.59pm, Tuesday 17 August, the number of new cases that werelinfectious while in the community should begin to decrease over the comingedays. With each additional day, new cases should also create fewer locationsof interest and contacts.v6 The Director-General of Health’s interim advice, as of Sunday 22 August, is thatwe cannot yeti rule out wider community transmission, given there are stilltoutstanding individual and wastewater testing results, contact tracing, and casecinformation, and the still evolving outbreak with increasing cases every day.Additionally, some high-risk locations of interest, such as the University ball,achurches, and healthcare facilities, are likely to have been attended by peoplewho have since travelled across New Zealand. Given we have had only twoodays of lockdown since the travel window ceased, the Director-Generalconsiders it prudent to allow at least seven days to elapse to assess if therapproach has been effective at preventing spread.P7Therefore, I recommend that Cabinet agrees to extend Alert Level 4 settingsfor the whole of New Zealand until 11.59pm Sunday, 29 August, in line with theDirector-General of Health’s interim advice. Cabinet will review Alert Levelsettings next on Friday 27 August, by which time seven days will have passedsince the 48-hour window in which people could travel home had ceased. Thisnext decision point also allows for sufficient time to safely implement aboundary between parts of New Zealand at different Alert Levels, if required.8 Communications over the coming days should emphasise the need for anyonewith symptoms throughout New Zealand to get tested. This testing data will19xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEprovide us with assurance that we do not have COVID-19 cases outside ofAuckland and Wellington. This is particularly important for anyone who hasbeen in Auckland in the past two weeks, is now elsewhere in New Zealand, andnow has symptoms.9 This paper also sets out considerations relevant to a future decision to de- descalate Alert Level settings, regarding the placement of and permittedmovements through any boundary between areas of higher and lower AelertLevels. When Cabinet next reviews Alert Levels, we will consider whether amove down Alert Levels is possible. For example, if there are still no cases insthe South Island, or if any cases detected have been in isolation throughouttheir infectious period, the South Island moving to Alert Level 3 could be anaoption.e10 It is important that sufficient time is allowed to implement an Alert Levelboundary so that it is effective and achieved its purpose – to restrict movementto prevent the transmission of the virus. The Directorl-General of Health’s adviceeis that this would take 24-48 hours. This is supported by operational agenciessuch as Police. The relative simplicity of a North Island-South Island boundarymeans this would be quicker to implement. RHow we make Alert Level decisions11 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theyappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand:l11.1 the Director-General of Health’s satisfaction on four health matters:e11.1.1 the source of the case(s) or outbreak (noting new variants ofconcvern), and the number and geographical distribution ofclusters;i11.1.2t the length of time the virus has been in the community and thec potential for undetected transmission (i.e. between the sourceand the case);a11.1.3the containment of the case(s) and/or cluster(s), includingconsideration of the potential for undetected communityotransmission occurring in New Zealand or in quarantine-freetravel countries;rP12the capacity and capability of our public health systems, including oursurveillance and contact tracing systems;13 evidence of the effects of the measures on the economy and society morebroadly;14 evidence of the impacts of the measures for at risk populations in particular;15 public attitudes towards the measures and the extent to which people andbusinesses understand, accept, and abide by them; and29xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVE15.1 our ability to operationalise the restrictions, including satisfactoryimplementation planning [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer].16 In line with our resurgence response plan, in determining what measures andcontrols should be in place after the immediate response phase, we areparticularly interested in: d16.1 the connection of cases to a known source at the border;e16.2 the number of cases and close contacts; ands16.3 the geographic spread of cases, including across regions.aThe current responsee17 At 11.59pm, Tuesday 17 August, all New Zealand moved to Alert Level 4 [CAB-21-MIN-0324 refers]. On Friday 20 August, Cabinet agreed to keep all NewZealand at Alert Level 4 until at least 11.59pm, Tuelsday 24 August [CAB-21-eMIN-0330 refers]. These settings are being reviewed today, on Monday 23August.RSituation report18 The first detected case was a 58-year old, unvaccinated male from Devonport.He presented to his GP on Monday 16 August and tested positive on Tuesdayy17 August. Since then, there have been 106 additional cases detected, for atotal of 107 confirmed cases, as of 09.00am on Monday 23 August 2021.le19 With Alert Level 4 in place from 11.59pm Tuesday 17 August, and an assumedaverage incubation time of two to four days, the number of new cases that werevinfectious while in the community should begin to decrease over the comingdays.it20 However, we are not yet seeing the effects of the Alert Level 4 restrictions incthe case data. Most of the 107 cases identified so far represent transmissionthat occurred prior to detection; very few cases are determined to have been inaisolation for the entirety of their infectious period. With each additional day, newcases reported that are deemed to have been infectious in the communityoshould have relatively fewer locations of interest and contacts due to Alert Level4 restrictions.r21Pacific peoples are disproportionately represented in this outbreak, numberingP70 of the 107 cases as of 09.00am, Monday 23 August. New Zealand’s Pacificcommunities are especially vulnerable to COVID-19. Our Pacific population ishighly urbanised, face financial challenges, and many are living in damp, coldand overcrowded housing conditions which increases the risk of transmissionof infectious diseases. These factors – challenging in normal circumstances –are significantly amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic, as apparent in theAuckland August 2020 outbreak.22 Updated modelling from Te Pūnaha Matatini suggests that it is likely that therewere around 100 cases in the community at the point of detection (17 August),with a range from around 40 to over 200. This is based on what we know about39xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEthe likely origins of the cluster, recent community testing rates and wastewatersurveillance. This is consistent with daily case numbers since Tuesday. Themodelling cannot tell us whether recent case numbers represent an optimistic“high-detection, low-spread”, or a pessimistic “low-detection, high-spread”scenario. Modelling from ARPHS also suggests that the number of casesdetected each day is still likely to increase in the near-term. d23 Analysis of movement data derived from transaction records suggests theat inthe week prior to initial detection, it is likely that there were over 100,000 visitsto Auckland from people in other locations, and over 100,000 Aucklanders whostravelled to other regions. The movement data indicate the potential risk oftransmission is roughly equivalent from Auckland to Wellington, Hamilton,aTauranga, Christchurch, Queenstown and the Coromandel. We know thatcases travelled to the Coromandel and others have returned to Wellington.e24 Our response to this Delta outbreak is informed by learning from overseasexperience, particularly where we are seeing succeslsful outcomes:e24.1 Australian states have experienced hugely different outcomes based onhow quickly they introduced restrictioRns. Authorities in Queensland andVictoria have demonstrated that even with significant transmission pre-detection, early and stringent intervention can act to limit case numbers.24.2 However, the current situaytion in Victoria highlights the risks of relaxingrestrictions too soon. Authorities chose to relax restrictions after 12 days,as cases reduced to 1l0 per day. They are now returning to a state-widelockdown following econcurrent days with over 50 new cases recorded.24.3 Countries such as Singapore and China demonstrate that aggressivevand effective test, trace, isolate and quarantine measures, alongsidestringent non-pharmaceutical interventions can control outbreaks ofiDelta,t avoiding exponential growth in new cases.1cDirector-General of Health’s interim assessment against the health factorsSource of thae case(s)/outbreak25 The source investigation has suggested a link to an MIQ case on 7 August, butotheremay be unidentified intermediaries in the chain of transmission. Of the107 community cases identified (as of 09.00am Monday 23 August), 61 casesrare epidemiologically linked to the initial cluster. A further 46 cases are currentlyP unlinked with investigations for a link ongoing.26 100% of workers at Auckland Crowne Plaza and Jet Park are compliant withthe vaccination requirements. For workers across both facilities who had notbeen swabbed in the preceding 48 hours and were asked to be re-swabbed, by22 August there were five outstanding, three of whom had been swabbed but1 Taiwan’s recent large outbreak began in late April, driven by cases of the Alpha variant. Taiwandetected cases infected with the Delta variant by the end of June, while the response to the previousoutbreak was continuing. Taiwanese authorities are now in a similar position to Singaporeancounterparts, with a continuing low level of cases but not exponential growth.49xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEtheir details were yet to be registered. More detailed information is in AppendixOne.Length of time the virus has been in the community27 The initial detection in the cluster was a positive result on 17 August. Thisdsuggests that the virus was circulating in the community for a period of at leastten days prior to detection.ePotential for undetected community transmissions28 There is still not sufficient information to be confident there is no transmissionelsewhere in New Zealand, including community and wastewater testing data.aThere are over 13,000 contacts and over 300 locations of interest, including anumber of high-risk locations such as the University Ball, churches andhealthcare facilities, after which contacts are expected to heave travelled acrossNew Zealand.l29 Cases have since been identified in Wellingtone. A number of known closecontacts have since travelled across New Zealand and it is likely that there areadditional unknown close and casual contacRts who have recently left Auckland.Of the more than 6,500 contacts whose locations have been confirmed, over100 have South Island addresses, of which 79 are Close + or Close contacts.Health system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systemsy30 The health system is responding well to the current outbreak. Hospitaloccupancy is around 74 perclent on average, while intensive care occupancy isejust over 50 percent.31 Contact tracers havev identified over 13,000 contacts, of which over 6,500 havebeen formally followed up and are self-isolating, and around a third havereturned an iniitial test result. Contacts from high-exposure, large events andessential wotrkers have been prioritised. Work is underway to contact theremainingc contacts, with many of these only recently identified.32 In thea last week, more than 127,000 tests have been processed, equivalent toalmost three percent of the New Zealand population. From receipt of a swab ata laboratory to notification of a positive results, 84% are notified of a positiveotestresult within 24 hours. Testing rates have been highest across the Aucklandregion: DHBs have delivered their highest ever numbers of test results in recentrdays,in some cases for well over 1 percent of their populations per day. WithinPthese numbers, testing rates for Pacific peoples are significantly higher than thenational average. Appendix 1 contains comprehensive information on testingrates by DHB and ethnicity, and in relation to identified contacts.33 However, on Sunday, 22 August there were a large number of tests still to beprocessed. The vast majority of these will be cleared by the end today. Labsacross the country have enacted their surge plans and are processing testsfrom the Auckland region. Urgent processing is focussing on necessary testingonly.59xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVE34 ESR is now testing wastewater at 41 sites around the country, covering 3.7million New Zealanders.35 There are good stocks of PPE, with at least a month's reserves to meetpandemic demand. In addition, the Ministry of Heath continues to confirmorders and receive shipments of more PPE every week. This week the Ministry dis expecting to receive supplies of two million N95/P2 particulate respiratorsand 50,000 face shields. The current burn rate is sitting within medeiumpandemic usage.s36 The Ministry's National PPE and Critical Medical Supply Chain team isreviewing DHB stock on hand for renal consumables and ventilatoraconsumables. Letters of expedition have been furnished to all suppliers whereconsumables are in short supply.eDirector-General’s conclusions2l37 The following conclusions informed the Director-General’s recommendations:e37.1 the dispersal of individuals across the country in the lead up to theRimplementation of Alert Level 4 and that we should wait at least sevendays from the end of the 48 hour period in which people could travelhome (11.59pm Thursday, 19 August) before considering lowering AlertLevels;y37.2 the growing number of locations of interest and significant potential theyoffer for the further splread of the virus; ande37.3 the significant number of outstanding individual testing results (followingunprecedentevd testing rates) and wastewater testing results.Proposal it38 On the basis of information available on Sunday 22 August, the Director-Generalcof Health’s interim public health advice is that all New Zealand stays in Level 4until 11.59pm Friday 27 August with a further public health risk assessment onaThursday 26 August, and that Auckland is likely to remain at Alert Level 4 forlonger. The Director-General notes that it takes 24-48 hours to safely implementoaregional boundary for Auckland, in addition to the recommended period at AlertLevel 4. This means that in effect, all of New Zealand would need to remain atrAlertLevel 4 until at least 11.59pm Saturday 28 August.P39I consider that an extension of Alert Level 4 for all New Zealand is an appropriatemeasure in response to the level of public health risk, including the risk oftransmission throughout the country. I therefore recommend extending AlertLevel 4 settings for all New Zealand until 11.59pm Sunday 29 August, with thenext Cabinet review on Friday 27 August. This timeframe allows implementationof any Alert Level change involving a regional boundary, should Cabinet choose2 The Director-General of Health’s conclusion is based on information available as of late Sunday, 22August. Case/contact data in this paper reflects the latest figures as at 9am Monday, 23 August.69xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEto do so, in accordance with the Director-General’s advice re allowing sufficienttime from review by Cabinet.Assessment of the proposed measures/options against the non-health factors40 I have assessed the proposal to remain at Alert Level 4 against the non-healthdfactors agreed by Cabinet, as set out below. My assessment gives me no reasonto question the proposal to remain at Alert Level 4. However, I am concernedeabout increasing mental health impacts and the toll on front line workforcesincluding Police and supermarket workers. Reports of non-compliance are alsosworrying and is something I will report on in more detail in future Alert Levelreview papers. Although there is a significant financial cost of being at Alert Levela4, it remains clear that that a strong health response is the best economicresponse. Social licence appears to remain strong but is something we willecontinue to monitor closely. Although there is a disproportionate impact upon atrisk communities from being at Alert Level 4, they are also very vulnerable if theylcontract COVID-19. eEconomic impacts from Alert LevelsR41 The Treasury’s assessment of the economic impacts of different Alert Levelsettings was provided in the Alert Level review Cabinet Paper of Friday20 August 2021. Domestic and interna tional economic data since the emergenceof the pandemic continues to bayck our strategy that a strong public healthresponse has been the best economic response.lImpacts on at risk populations e42 The impacts of Alert Level 4 will amplify as the period we remain in Alert Level 4vlengthens. Although higher Alert Levels assist in preventing communitytransmission in more vulnerable communities, they disproportionately impactisome groups, especially those living in Auckland. The impacts on at risktpopulations are set out in Appendix 2, and include:c42.1 restrictions on earning and movement (which can intensify income andapovertyinequities);o42.2 support for essential workers (including childcare arrangements, supportto adhere with public health advice and get vaccinated);r42.3inequitable access to testing sites and to essential services;P42.4 increasing the digital divide and access to key information; andincreased anxiety.42.5 Tailored communication and engagement are important across allgroups.Public attitudes and compliance43 Social licence remains crucial to a successful COVID-19 response through themaintenance of public trust. Our messaging will be informed by the sentiment we79xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEare seeing through our channels, insights reports, and pulse check research.Research indicates that most people are happy or okay about the shift to AlertLevel 4, and even those who are unhappy mostly recognise that it is the rightthing to do. We have seen a significant shift from neutrality and joy in July, tonegative emotions in August. South Islanders are significantly more likely to feelddisgust (23%) than the total sample (7%).44 The Unite Against COVID-19 social medial channels have reached 4.8 meillionpeople through Facebook and 1.2 million on Instagram. Most questions receivedon these channels in the past three days relate to: rules around tsravel andpermitted services, rules around exercising, vaccine concerns includingappointments being cancelled, does the vaccine work against thae Delta variant,how to get tested if you don’t have a car, and complaints about the wait to gettest results. People are starting to show frustration with bereaches and peoplenot complying with Alert Level rules.l45 Campaign messaging continues to focus on ensurineg people and business havethe key information they need to conform to the Alert Level 4 requirements.Vaccination messaging continues to be integrated into the campaign. ExtensionRof Alert Level 4 will drive the campaign to focus on financial support, wellbeingas well as continued health behaviours and compliance.46 Police continues to deal with some disorderly behaviour at some vaccinationysites, testing stations and supermarkets which they expect to continue duringAlert Level 4 restrictions. Publlic locations such as beaches and parks continueto see a large number of veisitors, particularly during fine weather. Since 5pmFriday 20 August, Police have received a total of 4,487 online breachnotifications, with 1,43v9 relating to breaches in Tāmaki Makaurau. Trend analysisof compliance data highlights parties are an ongoing issue. There have beencontinued reportis of protests, however, several protest leaders have advisedttheir followers of their intention not to attend protests planned during AL4. Thiscis likely due to notable arrests and messaging regarding hesitancy around theprotest.a47 Police expect to see an increase in mental health related calls for service fromiondividuals struggling with the current lockdown, particularly if the Alert Levelremains in place. UAC social channels report a number of people raising mentalrhealth issues (three instances serious enough to pass onto Police).PAbilityto operationalise the proposals in this paper48 There is growing concern across the system regarding the impact on operationsdue to workforce issues. Agencies and businesses are experiencing significantand increasing challenges due to staff having to isolate when identified as a closecontact (e.g. NZ Police, NZDF, Fire and Emergency NZ, supermarket staff,distribution centres). Many perform front line roles that cannot be done fromhome, while isolating.49 Other system-wide considerations regarding an extension of a nationwide AlertLevel 4 include:89xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVE54 Based on these differences, I consider that a shift to Alert Level 3 would createan unacceptable risk of further community transmission across New Zealand atthe current time.55 However, in preparation for a possible move down Alert Levels in the future, itis timely to consider how we could keep move the rest of the country to Alert dLevel 3 if we were confident community transmission was contained beyondAuckland. e56 We have never before had part of the country at Alert Level 4 and other partssat a lower Alert Level. Officials are rapidly undertaking policy work on how toestablish an Alert Level 4/3 boundary, in particular what movement would beapermitted across it. They are due to report to me later this week.57 In December 2020 I reported to Cabinet on how we woueld establish an AlertLevel 3/2 boundary and how we would decide what movement would bepermitted across it. I propose that if we needed tol quickly establish an AlertLevel 4/3 boundary in the context of the current oeutbreak – and I note that thisis not being proposed in this paper today – we would adopt the policy frameworkfor Alert Level 3/2 boundaries. Below I set oRut details of how this would work.Policy framework for establishing Alert Level 4/3 boundaries58 I consider that an Alert Level 4/3 boundary could be established using the AlertyLevel 3/2 boundary framework that was noted by Cabinet in December [CBC-20-MIN-0122 refers].le59 Officials developed the following principles for determining Alert Level 3/2 thatI consider are appropriate for Alert Level 4/3 boundaries:v59.1 Boundaries are appropriate and proportionate to support a public healthresponsie to COVID-19 that prevents and limits the spread of COVID-19(primatry consideration).c59.2 Boundaries minimise the need for people to travel between areas atadifferent Alert Levels to go to work, a place of learning, or to receivemedical treatment.o59.3Boundaries are practical and safe to implement and enforce.r59.4Boundaries minimise economic disruption to business and supply chainsP – e.g. ensuring businesses can continue to operate if safe to do so.59.5 Boundaries minimise equity impacts – e.g. access to life critical servicessuch as food.60 The fundamental public health premise is that under both Alert Level 3 and AlertLevel 4, unless it is essential to do otherwise, people should stay home. Peoplewithin an Alert Level 4 boundary are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19,so boundary crossings should be strictly limited.109xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVE61 As noted in the first principle, the public health considerations are the primaryconsideration – the purpose of an Alert Level boundary is to restrict movementto prevent transmission of the virus. However, in light of the higher public healthrisk that justifies being at Alert Level 4, it is appropriate to put even more weighton public health considerations. This means that my starting point is that anAlert Level 4/3 boundary should have stricter controls of movement across it dthan for an Alert Level 3/2 boundary.ePermitted movement across an Alert Level boundary62 Agencies have undertaken a significant amount of work on what msovementshould be permitted across Alert Level boundaries. This work is informed bythe experience of boundaries when Auckland was at Alert Leavel 3 in August2020 and February 2021, and in particular has focussed on primary industries.Currently, officials are proposing the following categoriese of movement wouldbe allowed across and Alert Level 4/3 boundary:l62.1 care of children and others (could be limited to either a shared caregiveresituation or to urgent care for a child or care and support for a person ina critical or terminal condition where no one in the Alert Level area canRprovide the care or support);62.2 accessing health services with an appointment (including a vaccineappointment);y62.3 accessing judicial institutions if required or permitted;le62.4 leaving or relocating home on court order;62.5 emergencies;v62.6 going hoime after isolation or quarantine (or arrival);t62.7 carcing for pets or other animals (for which a breach of the Animal WelfareAct 1991 would otherwise result) and the travel between Alert Levels isanecessary to enable to care to be provided; and62.8 working for certain specified categories of businesses or serviceso(including freight).r63 All these categories need to be analysed closely to ensure they areP appropriately defined to reflect the public health risk that justifies travel to andfrom an Alert Level 4 region and are subject to Ministerial approval.64 In terms of “certain specified categories businesses and services”, theframework that Cabinet considered outlined three categories for whichmovement of workers across a boundary could be allowed [CBC-20-MIN-0122refers]:64.1 Category 1 – movement that would be permitted under allcircumstances, e.g. border services, emergency services, healthcareworkers and all freight;119xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVE64.2 Category 2 – movement that could be permitted but for which a decisionwould be required when a boundary is established, e.g. production andsupply of food and beverage (for example, agriculture, horticulture,fishing, and aquaculture), veterinary and animal health services, andunion representatives (Category 2 businesses agreed by Cabinet areoutlined in Appendix 4); and d64.3 Category 3 – all other movement allowed by specific exemption isseuedby the Director-General of Health.s65 I consider that if an Alert level 4/3 boundary needed to be implemented as partof the current response, movement should initially be restricted to Category 1.aIn addition, in determining the location of the boundary, officials would identifykey factories and processing plants that are operating as Alert Level 4ebusinesses and services and either specifically permit in the Order their workersto cross the boundary to get to work, or agree that this be done through applyingfor an exemption from the Director-General of Healtlh. Restricting movement inethis way will minimise the risk of the virus spreading as any movement at allhas the potential to increase the current risk of transmission.R66 Category 1 movement would allow freight and life critical services to continueto operate but may disrupt some supply chains. However, this movementacross the boundary would be m ore limited than the “essential personalmovement” currently permitted yat Alert Level 4 across the country whichenables people to leave their place of residence where they are otherwiserequired to stay. le67 I also note that people who are permitted to cross an Alert Level boundary froman Alert Level 4 arvea to an area at Alert Level 3 would be encouraged toobserve Alert Level 4 restrictions while in the Alert Level 3 area.i68 Officials are tdoing further work on what movement should be permitted acrossan Alert Level 4/3 boundary, including what businesses and services should becincluded in Category 2, if any. Particular consideration will be given to how theproduction, processing and supply of food and beverage (as well as associatedasupply chain and sector compliance activity) could be safely facilitated. Anydecision about permitted categories of movement would have to beoproportionateto the level of risk and informed by public health advice at thetime an Alert Level boundary is established.rPProvisionsfor transit through the Alert Level 4 area69 Another consideration is what provision would be made for people to transit theAlert Level 4 area in addition to the movement permitted into and out of theAlert Level 4 area above. Previously, when Auckland was at Alert Level 3 andthe rest of the country at Alert Level 2, people could transit for the purpose ofgoing to or returning from work or going to the person’s principal home or placeof residence. In addition, the Director-General of Health granted exemptions forcompassionate travel.70 Transit creates some enforcement challenges and risks for the adjoining AlertLevel 3 areas as it is not possible to prevent stops within the Alert Level 4 area129xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVE(for example a person stopping for food or other purposes). Officials will provideadvice on whether these same provisions should be adopted in relation to anAlert Level 4/3 boundary.Business Travel Documentsd71 Business Travel Documents (BTD) were previously issued by the Ministry ofBusiness, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) to support Police enforcementeof the Alert Level 3/2 boundaries and could also be used for an Alert Level 4/3boundary. Through it, documents are issued that can be used as evidence of aperson’s right to travel across the boundary, being a worker for a spermittedbusiness or service. This system significantly increases the efficientmanagement of vehicles through checkpoints. a72 The system is a high trust model, largely relying on individuals’ applicationsereflecting a permitted reason to travel. No proof was required of applicants’ rightto travel, however, MBIE sampled applications to assess the legitimacy oflapplicants.e73 The use of the BTD system would be different in administering an Alert LevelR4/3 boundary. An Alert Level 4/3 boundary requires strict controls on movementand greater scrutiny of people crossing the boundary compared to a 3/2boundary where there is a greater focus on supporting efficient movement. It isimportant that there are clear communications to stakeholders that the bar forypermitted movement is high, many applications would not result in a BTD beingissued (as they do not meet the criteria) and the processing time could belsignificantly longer.e74 If the permissions for travel across a boundary are already known, the systemvcan be stood up very quickly (within an hour). However, it will take longer toactivate if there are substantive changes (approximately 6 hours from wheniMBIE receive an actionable draft Alert Level Order). There is an advantage intallowing lead in time as businesses and services can pre-register and receivecdocuments ahead of the boundary coming into effect. This lead in time wouldalso minimise delays at the boundary and would help to prevent travellers fromacrossing the boundary without a legitimate reason.75 oMBIE are doing work on how they would manage each of the permittedcategories to travel – importantly what is automatically issued and what isrissued manually. For example, MBIE consider that Category 1 businesses andservices (such as freight) are likely to be auto-approvals, whereas any CategoryP2 businesses and services that are permitted would likely be manuallyassessed to ensure that the travel is allowed by the Order.76 With previous Alert Level 3/2 boundaries sector agencies advised what waswithin the bounds of permitted categories in the Order – e.g. animal welfareapplications were sent to MPI to manually assess against the permissions inthe Order. A manual approach would require significant resources acrossagencies in order to assess and process business travel document requests. Itwould also mean slower processing (where auto-approval of permittedcategories meant very quick turnaround of applications).139xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVE77 Businesses and services that are not permitted to travel across the boundarycan seek an exemption from the Director-General of Health through theBusiness Travel Register. The decision on these exemptions is still made bythe Director-General based on advice from the relevant sector agency.Other exemptions d78 Experience tells us that creating an Alert Level boundary results in a largeenumber of exemption requests being made to the Director-General; many ofwhich do not meet the purpose of the Act and the Order.s79 In the light of numerous requests related to exemptions from Alert Level 4requirements during the current response, officials have consaidered whetherthere is a need to expand permitted activities or to extend or limit the scope ofexemptions. Many of the requests covered activities already permitted underethe Alert Level Order and therefore could be undertaken without an exemption.To reduce unnecessary requests, there will be clearer public-facinglcommunications about permitted activities. Agencies are also working on aneimproved process for responding to requests and will continue to review thesituation. A lower number of requests should mean more rapid consideration ofRrequests for an exemption.80 There may be a need for additional provisions to strengthen the policy intent ofthe exemption-making power, e.g. there must be express regard to the need toylimit unnecessary movement. If necessary, this will be addressed as part of theconsideration of permitted activities and exemptions in relation to movementlacross Alert Level boundaries.eOptions for an Alert Level 4/3 boundaryv81 Applying the principles outlined above, officials are developing options for AlertLevel 4/3 boundaries in case they are needed. Two options are:it81.1 Alert Level 4 for the North Island and Alert Level 3 for the South Islandcand the Chatham Islands; anda81.2 Alert Level 4 for Auckland (using the boundary last used when Aucklandwas at Alert Level 3 in February 2021) and Alert Level 3 for the remainderoof New Zealand.r82 When Cabinet next reviews Alert Levels, if there are still no cases in the SouthIsland or if any cases detected have been in isolation throughout their infectiousPperiod, we will consider whether the South Island could move Alert Level 3.83 Allowing sufficient time to effectively implement an Alert Level boundary isimportant to ensure its effectiveness in restricting movement to preventtransmission. This concern if reflected in the Director-General of Health’s viewthat 24-48 hours is required. A boundary between the North Island and SouthIsland would be the most straightforward for Police to implement and enforceand would be easily communicated. This would mean it could possibly beoperationalised quicker than the 24-48 hours noted by the Director-General. Inote also there would be fewer businesses and services needing to travel149xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEbetween the islands and requiring BTDs. This would mean standing up thatsystem could be quicker and there would be fewer requests for documents.84 Officials have consulted iwi about possible Alert Level boundaries aroundAuckland. Northland iwi are firmly of the view Northland should stay at AlertLevel 4 along with Auckland. They believe there are clear social, economic and dcultural reasons to do so. They advised iwi Māori will manaaki (care for) theirpeople, provided the Alert Level settings enable them to do so. Northern iwei areseeking a partnership role with Police to assist with ensuring whānau are safe,in particular for stopping movement.s85 Auckland iwi are very concerned with protection of their people and willaestablish checkpoints if they feel the Alert Level boundaries do not providesufficient protection.e86 All iwi are seeking assurance that boundaries will not prevent whānau fromaccessing vaccination and testing, or from providinlg necessary support, e.g.efood and access to face coverings.87 There is already a great deal of concern fromR iwi about holiday makers headingnorth and presenting a risk to virus spread. Anecdotal evidence suggests thatthere were as many as 2000 attempted to cross into Northland in the first 48hours of being at Alert Level 4. Conc ern that there will still be movement, bothnorth and into the Coromandel, inycluding within an Alert Level boundary, whichputs iwi at risk from spread of the virus. Iwi requested that checkpoints be setup at key areas while in Alelrt Level 4 (not just with a boundary change). Thisewould address the risk of people travelling to holiday homes in Northland andCoromandel.vImplementation of an Alert Level 4/3 boundaryi88 Implementingt and enforcing a lengthy boundary across several parts of theNorth Islacnd would be more challenging for Police, who will need to redirectresources to establish the necessary checkpoints.a89 This points to the need to have a reasonable lead in time between a decisionto establish an Alert Level 4/3 boundary and it coming into effect. Agenciesoconsidera minimum of 48 hours is workable. This will enable sufficient time forPolice and Waka Kotahi to establish and resource checkpoints, engagementrwithiwi and other affected regional stakeholders, MBIE to prepare the BTDP system, and public communications material to be prepared. I note that theDirector-General also considers it would take 24-48 hours to safely implementa boundary.Financial Implications90 On 18 August 2021, Delegated Ministers agreed to activate both theResurgence Support Payment (RSPAUG21) and Wage Subsidy Scheme(WSSAUG21).

Around 86% of all Māori live in the North Island, 23% of all Māori live in theAuckland region, and a further 3.5% live in Thames-Coromandel or Waikato.d2. Previous lockdowns have shown the strength of Māori community and iwinetworks in supporting and connecting whānau. Whānau Ora CommissioningeAgencies are currently responding to requests for meeting essentials. Te PuniKōkiri advise the priorities for Māori wellbeing being reported by the communitysare currently food, vaccinations and testing.a3. An extension to Alert level 4 will intensify demands for support from householdsunable to meet the essential needs of whānau at this time: access to food andhygiene packs, warm and secure housing, and covereing costs for thosehouseholds unable to pay for basics like power (around one in five Māorichildren live in hardship). Focus will need to remalin on promoting access totesting and vaccination services across age cohorets and across urban and ruralareas, to avoid creation of “hot spots” of vulnerable populations.R4. If the Alert Level 4 lockdown is extended, we should expect to see an increasein the impact and visibility of compounding stressors. For example, increasedfinancial stress, insecure housing, an d lack of access to essential services maycompound other existing factors ysuch as health, mental health, and maternityservice needs; social isolation and/or disability needs (e.g. kaumātua livingalone); and incidents relatedl to unstable homes e.g. those experiencing familyviolence. e5. Protective actions include clear messaging encouraging individuals, whānau,vMāori businesses and employers to access government financial assistance(e.g. wage subsidies etc). Continuity of access to education for tamariki andirangatahi wiltl also be important if we extend beyond 7 days, including ensuringcomprehensive access to devices and digital connectivity, particularly for keyccohorts such as those sitting NCEA or with low school attendance rates.a6. Overall, our ability to maintain whānau resilience and address immediate andemerging needs is at least partly dependant on clear messaging aboutochangingAlert Levels but also putting support behind regionally and locally leadsolutions. This will allow communities to adapt, plan and respond as relevant.rCentraland local government agencies need to continue to reach out to iwi,P hapū and Māori organisations (including Māori health and social serviceproviders) to ensure they are actively part of the regional responses. Theseorganisations will bring important insights and access to networks of people,which government will struggle to access.7. On this basis, support for locally led responses, transparency, and providing asmuch certainty as possible are critical to helping communities constructivelysupport and plan for whānau and individual needs. Iwi and hapū involvementenables much more targeted responses and communications to whānau thatutilise the main Alert Level 4 guidance but is more tailored to their audience.229xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEGuidance on tangihanga, mental health supports, COVID testing andvaccinations are all good examples of this.Pacific Peoples8. A significant proportion of the Pacific population living in New Zealand live indthe Auckland region, where the current outbreak is. Higher Alert Levels (i.e.Alert Level 3 and 4) impact the Pacific population in the following ways:ea. restrictions on earning capacity flowing from Alert Level shifts amplifyincome and poverty inequities; sb. restrictions on movement positively assist in prevenating COVID-19entering the Pacific community. This is critical considering the high riskof rapid transmission presented by household overcrowding and otherepractices that bring Pacific peoples together frequently (e.g. church/faith-based gatherings).lec. preventing the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the community is alsoimportant for Pacific peoples because they tend to have poor healthRoutcomes and high rates of comorbidities.9. It is critical to ensure that Pacific peoples are aware of the support they areeligible for, and how to access it. Ministry of Pacific Peoples will continue toplay a key role in communicating yeffectively with these populations throughoutthe response.l10. Ensuring we have the eright Alert Levels in place is crucial for Pacificcommunities as they are more susceptible to the worst effects of COVID-19.vDisabled Peoplei11. The Office for Disability Issues has advised that for disabled people the currenttissues requiring ongoing consideration are:ca. access to food and essential services when these are not able to beaaccessedindependently;ob. accessible testing stations, particularly where impairments make a longwait difficult – establish some specialist prioritisation options for thosedisabled people needing that option;rPc. access to key information in alternate formats – NZSL translations. Easyread, blind and low vision formats;d. consider standing up a disability call centre;e. vaccination promotion and support (there have been great examples oflow sensory sessions and the provision of transport);f. greater respect for those who have face covering exemptions (peopleare experiencing aggravation and hostility from security guards, thepublic, supermarkets etc);239xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEg. maintaining the provision of home and personal care services; andh. for COVID related services such as vaccinations gather information indata collection on disabled people accessing services – two simplequestions, do you need support today to access this service, are youdisabled. dEthnic Communitiese12. New Zealand’s ethnic communities make up roughly 20% of the population.About 60% of people from these communities live in Auckland. Smalsl businessowners will be highly impacted by the lockdown, particularly hospitalitybusinesses. a13. Digital connectedness is also a challenge experienced by some ethnicecommunity members, and a percentage of ethnic community members do notunderstand English. This combination of factors leaves ethnic communitieslhighly socially vulnerable in the context of COVID-19, particularly if they do notelive with whānau as part of their bubble under Level 4.RLow income households14. Since the move to Alert Level 4, social and community-based services havebeen clear about who provides servi ces and how to do this within the requiredsettings and public health requirements.y15. Since the announcement of a further period at Alert Level 4 there has been alfurther increase in demand for financial assistance for food and throughefoodbanks. This is concentrated in the Auckland region with large communities,such as church and school communities, all having to isolate and therefore notvbeing able to support each other. We anticipate this to continue to rise shouldthere be further cases in these communities.it16. If there is an extension at level 4 or a change to 3 in some areas we wouldcexpect to see a change in the level of concern, the way communities want torespond and the requests for funding, particularly in relation to food and PPE.aThis is predominantly because of the nature of communities in that they willwant to mobilise and be out and about supporting their most vulnerable. Thereoisa risk that this will drive a level of movement in communities that is counterto the overarching need to minimise movement. MSD alongside NEMA willrcontinue to work with communities and provide consistent messaging about theP supports already in place and the need to utilise existing channels.Older people17. Most older people are likely to be able to cope for a short Alert Level 4 lockdown. Organisations supporting older people have used their experience fromlast year to be able to quickly set up and operate/provide servicesremotely. Issues that will impact for a longer period of lockdown include:a. Bill paying – some people still pay bills in person and will be impacted bythe lockdown and not being able to pay their essential service bills(power, telephone etc).249xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEb. Accessing services that are online – this impacts on people who aredigitally excluded for whatever reason – for older people digital exclusionincreases with age.c. Food delivery services – with lockdown older people are encouraged toget others to do their shopping – this becomes problematic if they can’t dgo online or aren’t able to get someone to assist them – sometimespayment becomes an issue (access to cash). ed. We also note that there is ongoing anxiety over COVID and itssimpacts. This anxiety has been heightened with the more virulent Deltavariant now in the community. While many older people are vaccinated,athere are many still waiting and who are not able to get appointmentsdue to availability or prioritisation.eYoung peoplel18. In relation to youth, we have seen through Youthline, a significant surge inesupport being sought, even at this early stage. I am advised that if there is anextended period at Alert Level 4 or Alert Level 3 there will be a need to bolsterRfunding for this service, and potentially others, that are supporting this cohort.ylevitcaorP259xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEAppendix 3: Economic Supports Currently Available1. People can seek support from MSD via phone or online to help with food costs;accommodation costs; power, gas, heating or water bills; medical and dentalcosts. MSD should be contacted in the first instance, and social servicesproviders such as food banks can be contacted if no income support isdavailable. If people have an urgent food access need that cannot be addressedthrough these channels then they can contact their local Civil DefenceeEmergency Management Group, which have now been activated across thecountry.s2. The Wage Subsidy Scheme August 2021 scheme helps eligible businesses(including those who are self-employed) to continue paying emplaoyees andretain them for the period of the subsidy. The subsidy will pay $600 for full-timeemployees and $359 for part-time employees and applicatieons can be madefrom 20 August. The Scheme is open for 2 weeks.l3. The Resurgence Support Payment is available for firms who incur a loss ofe30 percent of revenue as a result of the Alert Level increase. The RSP is worthup to $1500 plus $400 per full-time equivalent employee, up to a maximum ofR50 full-time employees (a maximum amount of $21,500).4. The Leave Support Scheme provides businesses with a two-week lump sumpayment of either $600 per week for full-time employees or $359 per week forypart-time workers who must self-isolate and can’t work from home, or who needto self-isolate due to family members etc. Payment increases will not take effectluntil 24 August.e5. The Short-Term Absence Payment (STAP) provides businesses with a one-voff (once per 30 days) payment of $359 for employees who must miss work dueto a COVID-19 test and cannot work from home. STAP payments can be madeimore than once in a 30 day period under certain circumstances (which couldtapply during this lockdown). Payment increases will not take effect until 24cAugust.6. Emploayers cannot get the COVID-19 Wage Subsidy, COVID-19 Leave SupportScheme or the Short-Term Absence Payment for the same employee for thesoame period.7. Social and community-based services will continue to provide support to NewrZealanders.MSD has provided additional advice to providers about who canPoperate – social services that provide and support a place for someone to live;social services that support disabled people to maintain critical wellbeing; andcrisis support for people who are unsafe.269xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:40:31SENSITIVEAppendix 4 – Movement over Alert Level boundaries: Category 2 businessesand services1.

However, this notice period isnot required to be observed where the Minister is satisfied that the order should come into forceurgently to prevent or contain the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 or where the effect of the orderis only to remove or reduce requirements imposed by a COVID-19 order.In this instance, amendments to the order either clarify existing settings or are a reduction ofotherwise applicable requirements. Accordingly, we consider that the 48-hour notice period neednot be observed in this case. dConsultation eThe Act requires that before making a COVID-19 order, you consult with the Prime Minister, theMinister of Justice, and the Minister of Health.sYour office kindly facilitated consultation with the relevant Minister’s offices on the basis of aasummary of the amendments last night and earlier today.

It signals an intent to move allsthe country below Auckland down to Alert Level 3 at that stage should the PublicHealth risk assessment and advice support this shift.aRelationship with Government prioritiese2 This paper concerns the Government’s response to COVID-19.Summary le3 Since the first positive test on Tuesday 17 August 2021, the number of newcases has continued to increase. If Alert Level 4 were having a significantRimpact on reducing transmission (i.e. comparable to Alert Level 4 in 2020), thenmodelling suggests that case numbers will peak and begin to flatten over thecoming days. There are 348 cases as at 9am Friday 27 August, all but 14 ofwhich are in Auckland.y4 The Director-General of Health’s updated public health advice is that the wholelcountry should remain at Alert Level 4 until at least 11.59pm Tuesday 31eAugust. Cabinet will meet again on Monday 30 August, and at which point theycould consider moving the country (excluding Auckland) to Alert Level 3 fromv11.59pm Tuesday 31 August for at least a week.i5 The Public Health risk assessment notes that there is confidence there are notundetected cases in the South Island or the rest of New Zealand outside ofcAuckland and Wellington. However, the Director-General’s updated publichealth advice today suggests keeping the country at Alert Level 4 for a full twoaweeks (until Tuesday 31 August) will give the country the best shot ateliminating this outbreak. He advises that the current situation regarding theoSouth Island is finely balanced, but given outstanding wastewater results inChristchurch, and from an abundance of caution, maintaining a nationalrapproach at this time is prudent.P6The Director-General also advises that, in order to provide greater certainty, itwould also be useful to signal that Auckland is likely to be at Alert Level 4 foranother week.7 I agree that the outbreak appears contained but, consistent with the Director-General’s updated advice, would like greater certainty about outstanding testresults. Therefore, I propose that Cabinet agrees to keep all New Zealand atAlert Level 4 until at least 11.59pm Tuesday 31 August. At the Cabinet reviewon Monday, should the latest results not show any sign of unexpectedtransmission beyond Auckland, I would expect to recommend a move to Level19xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVE3 for all New Zealand below Auckland. I remain cautious about Northlandbecause of the recent Warkworth cases and am mindful of the views expressedby iwi and regional leaders.8 It is important that when (parts of) the country is ready to move to Alert Level 3sufficient time is allowed to implement a land-based Alert Level boundary so dthat it is safe, effective and achieves its purpose – to restrict movement toprevent the transmission of the virus. The Director-General of Health’s inteerimadvice is that this would take up to 48 hours for a boundary around Aucklandfrom the time Cabinet decides to shift. This timeframe is supported bysoperational agencies. I consider that if we strongly signal that a step down forareas below Auckland to Alert Level 3 is likely following Monday’s review,aagencies will have sufficient time to prepare for a change to commence by11.59pm Tuesday.e9 This paper sets out information to operationalise any decision to de-escalateAlert Level settings, including the placement of, alnd permitted movementsethrough, any boundary between areas of higher and lower Alert Levels.How we make Alert Level decisions R10 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer]:y10.1 the Director-General of Health’s satisfaction on four health matters:le10.1.1 the source of the case(s) or outbreak (noting new variants ofconcern), and the number and geographical distribution ofclustvers;10.1.2 ithe length of time the virus has been in the community and thetpotential for undetected transmission (i.e. between the sourcec and the case);a10.1.3 the containment of the case(s) and/or cluster(s), includingconsideration of the potential for undetected communitytransmission occurring in New Zealand or in quarantine-freeotravel countries;r10.1.4 the capacity and capability of our public health systems,P including our surveillance and contact tracing systems;10.2 evidence of the effects of the measures on the economy and societymore broadly;10.3 evidence of the impacts of the measures for at risk populations inparticular;10.4 public attitudes towards the measures and the extent to which peopleand businesses understand, accept, and abide by them; and29xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVE10.5 our ability to operationalise the restrictions, including satisfactoryimplementation planning;The current response11 At 11.59pm, Tuesday 17 August, all New Zealand moved to Alert Level 4 [CAB-d21-MIN-0324 refers].12 On Friday 20 August, Cabinet agreed to keep all New Zealand at Alert Leveel 4until at least 11.59pm, Tuesday 24 August [CAB-21-MIN-0330 refers].s13 On Monday 23 August, Cabinet agreed to extend Alert Level 4 settings forAuckland until 11.59 pm, Tuesday, 31 August, and agreed to exatend Alert Level4 settings for the rest of New Zealand until 11.59 pm, Friday, 27 August [CAB-21-MIN-0336 refers].eSituation reportl14 The first detected case was a 58-year old, unvacceinated male from Devonport.He presented to his GP on Monday 16 August and tested positive on Tuesday17 August. Since then, there have been 347 additional cases detected, for aRtotal of 348 confirmed cases, as of 9am on Friday 27 August 2021. The Ministryof Health advises that the list of locations of interest where ARPHS hasdetermined there is known transmiss ion within those events remains limited tothe Auckland region.y15 New Zealand’s Pacific communities remain especially vulnerable to COVID-19land continue to be disproportionately represented in this outbreak. PacificePeoples account for over 50% of the current COVID-19 cases, with theMāngere Assembly of God Church (AOG) of Samoa presenting as the largestvsub cluster of this outbreak. Direct engagement with the community notesemerging and ongoing impacts related to self-isolation challenges for largeriintergenerational families, challenges meeting the criteria to access supportt(e.g. food parcels, financial support), vaccination and testing stations requiringca booking, and increased racial discrimination targeted towards Pacificpeoples.aUpdated modelling in relation to the current outbreako16 Te Pūnaha Matatini (TPM) have continued to refine their modelling results to fitto emergent case data.rP16.0Size of cluster at detection: The large and increasing number of casesdetected during this week have led to revisions in their estimates for thesize of the cluster at point of detection, suggesting that there may havebeen 250- 300 infected individuals at the point of detection. There is alarge estimated range, reflective of the uncertainty in estimatingtransmission when there are low numbers of cases.16.1 Impacts of Alert Level 4: It is still too early to estimate the impacts of AlertLevel 4 on transmission – in particular, whether the reproductive numberin Alert Level 4 is just above or just below 1. The following discussion ishighly indicative at this stage. If Alert Level 4 restrictions, contact tracing,39xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVEand case management measures are reducing transmission similarly tothe 2020 Alert Level 4, modelling results suggest that daily reportedcases may peak in the coming days, before beginning to flatten andtaper. At this early stage, it is difficult to estimate when new cases mayreduce below 10 per day, with modelling results giving a range from mid-September to mid-October. d16.2 In a more pessimistic scenario where Alert Level 4 is insufficienet toreduce the reproductive number below 1, modelled case numbers arenot likely to dramatically reduce in the near-term.s16.3 Separate to TPM, simple outbreak modelling by ARPHS suggests thatacase numbers may begin to fall in the coming days. This is based onassumptions about the pre-detection size, behaviour of the outbreak andea highly effective Alert Level 4. The Director-General of Health’s adviceis that the peak of the spread in Auckland is likely to be today orlSaturday, 28 August.e16.4 Chance of undetected cases outside of Auckland: TPM have updatedtheir estimates for the probability thaRt we would have detected any newcases (if they existed) outside of Auckland and Wellington throughwastewater and community testing. The results suggest only around a50% chance that cases are detected or transmission “fizzles out” byFriday 27 August. These eystimates are sensitive to the catchment areaof wastewater surveillance and the proportion of the symptomaticpopulation being teslted (where smaller, and higher, respectively,improve probability eof detection).16.5 Further analyvsis of movement data and the location of known casessuggests that Queenstown and Christchurch may now be consideredlower risik (than Wellington, for instance). On the other hand, given thehighert levels of “essential travel”, Hamilton could still be considered athigcher risk of transmission, based on movement data alone.16.6 In considering inter-regional transmission risk at this stage of theaoutbreak,after a full week with limited population movements, the datafrom contact tracing and test results of known contacts should be givenopriority.rSourceof the case(s)/outbreakP17The source investigation has suggested a link to an MIQ case on 7 August, butthere may be unidentified intermediaries in the chain of transmission. As at0900 Friday 27 August, 348 community cases have been identified, of which334 are in Auckland and 14 are in Wellington.18 Source investigation is ongoing into direct link(s) between the source case andthe community cluster. The initial detection in the cluster was a positive resulton 17 August. This suggests that the virus was circulating in the community fora period of at least ten days prior to detection.49xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVEUpdate on outbreak sub-clusters19 There remain six epidemiologically linked sub-clusters identified within thisoutbreak:19.0 Crowne Plaza: considered the source of the community outbreak (4dcases);19.1 AOG of Samoa Mangere: several events associated with this cheurch(117 cases);s19.2 Birkdale Social Network (associated with Case A): centred in the NorthShore/West Auckland, the s9(2)(a) cluster has beean moved to thisgroup, also includes s9(2)(a) (41 cases);e19.3 s9(2)(a)le19.4 AUT City: people exposed at the AUT City Campus (10 cases).R20 Importantly, the proportion of new community cases identified, and theirassociated exposure events is trending down. For example, of the 68 newcases identified on 25 August, 65 were cases with no exposure events, and3 had associated exposure evenyts. Further, the proportion of new communitycases originating from household exposure is increasing, with 37 out of the68 new cases identified onl the 25 August coming from household exposures.Graphs of both sets of deata can be found at Appendix 1.Potential for undetected covmmunity transmission outside of Auckland21 Health officials have gathered a reasonable level of evidence regarding theiparameters of this outbreak, and the Director-General of Health has confidencetthat the outbreak is largely contained outside of Auckland and Northland. ThecDirector-General is confident that potential transmission to the rest of thecountry has either not occurred or been contained (in the case of Wellington). Ianote that (as at 0800 26 August 2021) out of the 360 contacts across the SouthIsland, 330 have been tested and 357 are self-isolating.oHealth system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systemsr22While under strain, the health system continues to respond to the currentP outbreak. Hospital occupancy is around 75% (as at 26 August 2021), aroundhalf of the national coverage of intensive care bed occupancy (59.5% as at 26August 2021), and there remains significant ventilator availability across thecountry.23 As at 4pm Thursday 26 August, there were 24,405 contacts identified in relationto the August community cases recorded in the National Contact TracingSolution. 15,755 of these have been contacted and are self-isolating. Contactsat large exposure events, (e.g., schools), have been contacted already and arebeing added which impacts the numbers of contacts reached. These contactshave been given the appropriate advice. Of the total number of contacts, 22,87859xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVEare close contacts; these volumes are unprecedented, compared to onlyapproximately 2,600 close contacts identified during the August 2020 outbreakover a six-week period.24 Testing volumes remain high. In the last seven days, 270,382 tests have beencompleted, the majority in the Auckland region. On 25 August, 41,739 tests dwere recorded nationally. This is compared to a peak of approximately 22,000daily tests during the August 2020 outbreak. The Wellington region (Capitale andCoast, Hutt Valley and Wairarapa DHBs) recorded approximately 4,023 testsand the Auckland region (Auckland, Counties Manukau and Waitemata)srecorded approximately 23,811 tests. As of 9am Thursday 26 August, therewere approximately 1,500 tests awaiting processing (i.e. 48-72 hours sinceacollection and are not yet processed).e25 Wastewater testing analysis during this outbreak has included samples from 97sites, covering 3.8 million people. There are 70 locations on the North Island,and 27 locations on the South Island. A posiltive wastewater result ineChristchurch is of low concern as it is likely to be linked to cases in managedisolation. ESR is unable to do Whole Genome Sequencing for Christchurchwastewater samples as the concentration ofR the wastewater sample is too low.26 In terms of capacity for the ongoing response, testing, laboratory testingsupplies and PPE supplies all remai n high despite the surge in demand duringthe outbreak. The Ministry of Healyth’s national PPE supply chain currently holdsclose to 17 million N95/P2 particulate respirators, 277 million medical masks,17 million isolation gowns, 1l.6 million face shields, 272 million nitrile gloves,and good volumes of hande sanitiser, disinfectant wipes and other items of PPEutilised across the health and disability sector.vDirector-General’s of Health’s conclusions1i27 The following conclusions influence the Director-General’s recommendations:t27.1 thec large number of infectious cases in Auckland;27.2 athe high level of testing and returned test results outside of Auckland andNorthland;o27.3a requirement for further data, and contact tracing related to the recentlyidentified cases in Warkworth cases – these may have had contact withrpeople further north meaning a better assessment of the risk in NorthlandPis required;27.4 the absence of unexpected wastewater results; and27.5 the significant transmissibility risk of the delta variant.1 The Director-General of Health’s conclusion is based on information available as of late Thursday,26 August. Case/contact data in this paper reflects the latest figures as at 9am Friday 27 August.69xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVEProposal28 The Director-General of Health’s updated public health advice today is that thewhole country should remain at Alert Level 4 until at least 11.59pm Tuesday 31August. Cabinet will meet again on Monday 30 August, and at which point theycould consider moving the country (excluding Auckland) to Alert Level 3 fromd11.59pm Tuesday 31 August for at least a week.e29 The Public Health risk assessment notes that there is confidence there are noundetected cases in the South Island or the rest of New Zealand outside ofAuckland and Wellington. However, the Director-General’s updasted publichealth advice suggests keeping the country at Alert Level 4 for a full two weeks(until Tuesday 31 August) will give the country the best shot at aeliminating thisoutbreak.

In addition to the wastewater results in Christchurch, I note that only78% of Wellington-based contacts have returned a test result. As of Thursdayl26 August, date 40/3,385 (~1%) of contacts are “overdue” for testing results. Aefurther 140 (~4%) contacts in Wellington have results pending.v32 Therefore, I propose that Cabinet agrees to keep all New Zealand at AlertLevel 4 until at least 11.59pm Tuesday 31 August. At the Cabinet review oniMonday, should the latest results not show any sign of unexpected transmissiontbeyond Auckland, I would expect to recommend a move to Level 3 for all NewcZealand below Auckland. I remain cautious about Northland because of therecent Warkworth case and am mindful of the views expressed by iwi andaregional leaders.33 oIt is important that when (parts of) the country is ready to move to Alert Level 3sufficient time is allowed to implement a land-based Alert Level boundary sorthat it is safe, effective and achieves its purpose – to restrict movement toprevent the transmission of the virus. The Director-General of Health’s interimPadvice is that this would take up to 48 hours for a boundary around Aucklandfrom the time Cabinet decides to shift. This timeframe is supported byoperational agencies. I consider that if we strongly signal that a step down forareas below Auckland to Alert Level 3 is likely following Monday’s review,agencies will have sufficient time to prepare for a change to commence by11.59pm Tuesday, 31 August.Assessment of the proposed measures/options against the non-health factors34 I have assessed the proposal to keep the country at Alert Level 3 until Tuesday,31 August, against the non-health factors agreed by Cabinet, as set out below.79xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVE39 We are also collecting high-frequency economic data, which enables us tomonitor the real-time impact of Alert Level restrictions. As expected, earlysignals indicate a reduction in activity broadly similar to Alert Level 4 inMarch/April 2020. During the week ending 26 August:39.1 Light traffic was down by 74% compared to the previous week, and dheavy traffic was down 55%.e39.2 National electricity demand was down by 8.6% compared to the previousweek.s39.3 Electronic card spending was down 47% compared to 2019. This isasmaller than the 59% drop seen during the first week of the March/April2020 lockdown, possibly reflecting some adaptation by firms andbusinesses with online shopping and deliveries. e40 Previous lockdowns indicate that while activity doels fall sharply, a significantamount is deferred rather than lost, if the time speent under higher Alert Levelsrestrictions is kept short.R41 Domestic and international economic data since the emergence of COVID-19has backed our strategy that a strong health response has been the besteconomic response, as set out in CA B-21-SUB-0330.yEconomic support measures42 The Ministry of Social Devellopment (MSD) in collaboration with other socialagencies and NEMA adviese they are continuing to monitor the social impactsof any change in Alert Levels, and any additional support that might be requiredfor people and commvunities.43 The Wage Subisidy Scheme August 2021 has had strong uptake with $759.331million paid ats at 26 August, supporting 677,063 jobs. Applications to date havebeen almocst entirely from businesses with under 500 employees. The numberof people on main benefit increased by 2,508 in the week to 20 August andafurther increases are likely. Food grants also increased significantly comparedto the week before lockdown, reflecting the need many people are experiencingoinaccess to food, especially in Auckland. Appendix 2 sets out further detailregarding the economic supports that are available and uptake to date.rImpactson at risk populationsP44The impacts of Alert Level 4 increase as the period we remain in Alert Level 4lengthens. Although higher Alert Levels assist in preventing communitytransmission in more vulnerable communities, they disproportionately impactsome groups. The impacts on at risk populations are set out in more detail inAppendix 3, and include (but are not limited to):44.1 restrictions on earning capacity (e.g. loss of jobs, reduced hours, and theimpact of finances of families) which can amplify income and povertyinequities;99xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVE44.2 support for essential workers (including childcare arrangements, supportto adhere with public health advice and get vaccinated);44.3 challenges associated with digital connectedness, and inequitableaccess to testing sites, essential services, and material essentials suchas food, hygiene products, and shelter and warmth; and d44.4 ongoing concerns around mental health, with support serviceseexperiencing a significant surge in support being sought by communitiesin relation to their mental and general wellbeing.s45 MSD, NEMA and social service providers will continue to work withacommunities and provide consistent messaging about the supports already inplace and how to utilise existing support channels.ePublic attitudes and compliancel46 Social licence remains crucial to a successful COVID-19 response through theemaintenance of public trust. Government messaging continues to be informed bythe sentiment we are seeing through our channels, insights reports, and pulseRcheck research.47 Recent qualitative research (conducted post lockdown) showed that, althoughpeople had less time to adjust, in terms of dealing with the current level fourylockdown, people feel more psychologically prepared and less anxious this timearound. This emotional acceptance has been shaped strongly by the alarminglspread of Delta in Australia.e48 By 5pm Thursday, 26 August, Police had received 9,259 online breachnotifications through ivts 105 system, with 2,986 relating to breaches in TāmakiMakaurau. There have been continued reports of protests, with one planned foritoday in Auckland. Police advise that public sentiment remains predominantlyt“calm” and “subdued”. Negative commentary continues to criticise protestors andcthose who refuse to wear masks. However, Police note that lockdown measureswill likely continue to exacerbate issues for those experiencing mental healthaissues and substance abuse.Abilityo to operationalise the proposals in this paper49 Given consideration has been given to keeping the Northland region at AlertrLevel4 along with the Auckland region, officials have undertaken engagementPwith local leaders, including Iwi. The key themes from that engagement were:49.1 strong support for Northland to be at the same Alert Level as Auckland;49.2 general support for the northern and southern boundary definition;49.3 concern about declining resilience amongst some Māori communities;49.4 Police agreed to partner with iwi in operating checkpoints.109xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVEAlert Level 4/3 boundaries50 To implement any recommendation to move to Alert Level 3 in some areas ofthe country, an Alert Level boundary is required. A North Island / South Islandboundary is relatively straightforward to define and implement given there arerelatively few air and maritime ports from which people can travel between thedvarious islands. The key challenge for travel between islands is implementingchanges to systems, including communicating eligibility to travel andeacceptable required evidence.51 A North Island/South Island boundary will be managed by Waka Kotashi staff atferry terminals, with support from MPI for animal welfare purposes. AviationSecurity provide the primary response at airports supported by Paolice who havea permanent presence at Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstownairports. Police would provide reassurance patrols and resepond to any calls forsupport in dealing with disturbances or people who are non-compliant withdirections to return to their normal place of residence.le52 For any regional boundary around Auckland and Northland, I propose that thesouthern boundary be that used in February 2021, including Port Waikato andRparts of the northern Waikato. A map of this area is attached in Appendix 4.An Alert Level 4/3 boundary should restrict movement as much as possible53 The fundamental public health preymise is that under both Alert Level 3 and AlertLevel 4, people should stay home, unless it is essential to do otherwise. UnderAlert Level 4 and 3 settings tlravel is restricted to essential personal movement,and there are very limiteed situations where travel around the country ispermitted. At higher Alert Levels, travel between Alert Level areas creates aneven greater risk ofv the virus spreading to other regions. An Alert Level 4/3boundary should therefore be tighter than previous boundaries created, suchas the Alert Leviel 3/2 boundary implemented in the February 2021 outbreak.tPermissions for movement across the Alert Level 4/3 boundary for workc54 Travel within an Alert Level 4 area for work is restricted to people:a54.1 working for an Alert Level 4 business or service (such as food ando beverage production); and54.2 working for a business or service that are exempt from the requirementsrof the Order (such as Police or NZ Fire and Emergency).P55In terms of movement of workers across the Alert Level boundary, I proposewe permit the same categories that are allowed to move within the current AlertLevel 4 area. This means that workers other than those described in paragraph54 will not be permitted to travel to an Alert Level 3 area to work for a businessor service that cannot operate at Alert Level 4 and vice versa. The Director-General will consider whether businesses and services which have beengranted exemptions to operate at Alert Level 4 should also be permitted tomove from one alert level area to another. (He can also grant exemptions moregenerally for travel across an Alert Level boundary.)119xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVE56 To minimise the cumulative risk of this travel I propose placing a new obligationin the Public Health Order on the employer to have systems and processes inplace to ensure the least number of workers needing to travel do so, andensuring the public health risks of anyone travelling between Alert Level 3 and4 areas are minimised. I also propose to include a requirement to make workersonly travel for the permitted purpose and not to stop en-route. dAgencies have consulted key businesses close to the proposed Alert Level bounedaryto discuss the extent of critical worker movement57 MPI and MBIE have had in confidence discussion with their sectorss on cross-boundary movement. These discussions focused on a regional boundaryaround Auckland because of the complexity and likelihood thaat a boundarythere would last for a longer period than one between islands. Combined withwhat we know about movement that occurred across the Aelert Level 3 boundaryin February, it appears there would be relatively limited movement across theAlert Level boundary under the proposed settings.le58 When Auckland was at Alert Level 3 during February 2021, 1,335 individualworkers for animal welfare (including vets) and 6,380 food and beverageRworkers were approved to travel across the Alert Level 3/2 boundary. Whilethere will be some changes in numbers based on seasonal factors, thisprovides an indication of the likely upper level of movement that might beexpected under an Alert Level 4/3 boundary. Movement between islands wouldybe far lower.l59 MPI has further tested this by contacting, in confidence, a small number of keyebusinesses that operate close to the proposed Auckland Alert Level boundary.These businesses are currently operating under Alert Level 4, with workersvregularly travelling across the region in order to maintain critical food andbeverage production, packaging and supply. Some indicative examples of likelyimovement include:tc59.1 Dairy – s9(2)(b)(ii)aor59.2Horticulture – s9(2)(b)(ii)P59.3 Meat – s9(2)(b)(ii)59.4 Processed food – s9(2)(a)129xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVE60 MBIE has engaged with a wide range of business representatives, FIRSTunion, and E Tu. All entities strongly supported allowing Alert Level 4 businessor service workers to cross the Alert Level boundary; and for that to befacilitated by the Business Travel Document system (discussed further below).Entities noted that preparing requests takes considerable time (identifyingworkers and uploading names), and so were keen that no further delays be dcreated. There would likely be concerns if a fully manual process wereintroduced. Specific risks noted by business representatives include: e60.1 Some non-essential work categories will face labour force constraints,sparticularly with an Auckland boundary e.g. aggregates/quarries.a60.2 The free flow of freight is essential to maintain supermarket servicesbetween islands.e60.3 A 24-48 hour notice period would be useful to enable businesses to planin advance of a boundary coming into effect. le60.4 Construction sector representatives suggested that where work will beable to recommence but contracted lRabour for that work is in a differentAlert Level area, the contract could be used as evidence to support theneed for those people to travel, rather than new firms / staff needing tobe found.y61 E Tu, was supportive of business’ ability to responsibly manage boundarytravel, noting that Air NZ, for example, already has good processes in place.lePermissions will also be required for movement across the Alert Level 4/3 boundaryfor non-work reasonsv62 In addition to the proposed permissions for workers, I propose people shouldonly be allowedi to travel across the Alert Level boundary (including to transitfrom one Aletrt Level 3 area to another) for the following purposes:c62.1 urgent care of a child or to provide care or support to a person in a criticalaor terminal condition (if no other appropriate person can provide carewithin the area);o62.2shared caregiving arrangements;r62.3access a health service with appointment (or receive their Pfizer vaccineP in the same or adjoining district);62.4 access a judicial institution where required or permitted, or to leave orrelocate home on Court order;62.5 return home from hospital or residential care or health service or relocateto another hospital or residential care or health service;62.6 emergencies;62.7 leave New Zealand;139xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVE62.8 go home – From Alert Level 3 to Alert Level 4 only;62.9 go home after MIQ (or arrival in NZ where no MIQ required); and62.10 care for pets or other animals, if travel is necessary to prevent a breachof the Animal Welfare Act and no one else in the area can provide the dcare.e63 I also propose that where people are travelling in and out of the Alert level 4area solely for the purpose of transiting from an Alert Level 3 area to anothersAlert Level 3 area, this is permitted for travel to work (including at an Alert Level3 business) and travel home.a64 In addition to these permissions, exemptions for personal travel across the AlertLevel 4/3 boundary can also be granted by the Director-eGeneral of Health ofHealth (including for compassionate reasons).l65 As noted above for workers, people who are permeitted to cross an Alert Levelboundary from an Alert Level 4 area to an area at Alert Level 3 would beencouraged to observe Alert Level 4 restrictions while in the Alert Level 3 area.RThis has been a source of confusion previously so we will ensure thecommunications are clear.Business Travel Documents can support Police enforcement at checkpointsy66 The Order specifies when people are required to carry evidence of the purposeof their travel from one Alert lLevel Area to another, including for work.e67 Business Travel Documents (BTDs) were previously issued by MBIE to supportPolice enforcementv of the requirement for evidence at Alert Level 3/2boundaries. They could also be used for the Alert Level 4/3 boundary. Thedocuments arei used by workers as evidence of their right to travel across theboundary (betcause they are a worker for a business or service that is permittedto travel accross the boundary). This system significantly increases the efficientmanagement of vehicles through checkpoints.a68 The system is a high trust model, with auto-processing largely relying onindividuals’ applications including a permitted reason to travel. No proof wasorequiredof applicants’ right to travel when used in the February 2021 outbreak,however, MBIE sampled applications to assess the legitimacy of applicants.rConstructionwas an area of concern. Animal welfare applications wereP manually reviewed by MPI because of previous confusion about whatconstitutes an animal welfare need.69 Officials propose that the BTD system continue to auto-process most requestsunder an Alert Level 4/3 boundary. To mitigate the risk of BTDs being issued tobusinesses whose workers should not be travelling, sector lead agencies wouldincrease their monitoring activities. Any erroneous requests can be revoked,and the business notified immediately. The integrity of this approach relies onworkers then destroying their documents or Police scanning documents andtaking action at the boundary checkpoints. Animal welfare and construction149xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVErequests would be manually reviewed by MPI and MBIE respectively (notingthat there should be relatively few applications for construction).Agencies are working to streamline the exemptions process for travel across theAlert Level 4/3 boundaryd70 Activities (such as travel) that are not permitted under an Alert Level Order canonly be undertaken if an exemption is granted by the Director-General ofeHealth. To grant an exemption, the Director-General must be satisfied theexemption is necessary or desirable to promote the purposes of the COVID-19Public Health Act 2020 (the Act) or the Alert Level Order. s71 Businesses and services can apply for exemptions for businessa travel throughMBIE’s BTD system. Sector lead agencies will review an exemption requestagainst agreed criteria and make a recommendation to the Director-General ofeHealth. MBIE will provide a daily report to the D-G for consideration. Businesseswill then be issued with an exemption by the D-G and a BTD for their workerslor advised that their request has been declined. This is the same process thatewas used in February 2021.R72 The Ministry of Health has established a system to manage requests forexemptions for travel across boundaries by individuals which has beensuccessfully implemented for the past two boundaries. An online form will beavailable for the public who apply for exemptions to cross boundaries. TheyMinistry of Justice has a MOU with the Ministry of Health to provide up to 80FTE to manage these requests effectively.le73 The Unite Against COVID-19 website sets out a plain language version of thelist of permitted personal movements specified in the Order. The website willvalso direct the public to the appropriate avenues for making a request for anexemption: to MBIE for initial processing of business or service exemptionirequests, to the Ministry of Health for individual requests (including ontcompassionate grounds), and to the COVID-19 email address for generalcrequests that are not related to exemptions.Implementaation of an Alert Level 4/3 boundary74 The effectiveness of an Alert Level boundary in preventing movement andoreducingrisk of transmission is greatly compromised if it is not properlyimplemented.rP75As noted in paragraph 49 above, a North Island / South Island boundary couldbe implemented within 12 hours of a Cabinet decision to move the South Island,the Chatham Islands and Stewart Island to Alert Level 3. A minimum of 48 hoursis required from when an Alert Level change is announced to implement anAlert Level boundary for Auckland and Northland. The time is needed toestablish the physical checkpoints (including freight lanes), stand up the BTDand set up the exemptions process.76 Police has successfully implemented a boundary at the southern and northernboundaries of the Auckland region under the previous COVID-19 Order thatestablished the Alert Level 3/2 boundary in February 2021. A similar southern159xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVEboundary would require checkpoints to be established at five fixed locationswith one roving checkpoint team to cover the rural areas in the west for thesouthern boundary. A boundary to the north requires five fixed checkpointslocations. Police estimates a total of 280 staff would be required for 24/7 coverof these checkpoints (based on at least 50 NZDF staff being available over each24-hour period). As checkpoints are established, Police intends to work with Iwi dto establish a partnership approach to their ongoing operation. They note thatthe proposed permissions for cross-boundary travel will probably reduce treafficflows and make checkpoints easier to manage.s77 Traffic flow in and out of Auckland is currently at levels higher than may beexpected at Alert Level 4. Police has therefore made the decision to establishacheckpoints at key locations to identify vehicles travelling without properauthority under the current Alert Level. If an announcement is made to keepeAuckland at Alert Level 4 and move the rest of the country to a lower Alert Level,Police intend to establish checkpoints as soon as is practicable at key locationslindicated above. Police will do this under the existing Alert Level 4 rules in ordereto minimise movement of people to lower Alert Level areas, prior to any new oramended Order coming into force.RProjected movement across North Island-South Island and Auckland Alert Level 4/3boundaries78 Officials expect that the numbers of people currently crossing what wouldybecome a North Island/South Island Alert Level boundary are as follows:l78.0 Interisland maritime travel: using recent Alert Level 4 travel data averageearound 90 passengers per day over the last five days, with freightvolumes down on normal.v78.1 Interisland air travel: using recent Alert Level 4 data around 600ipassengers per day in total (350 North to South and 250 South to North).tIt is possible this could increase initially if people return to the Alert Levelc4 area from Alert Level 3.79 Officaials expect that Auckland land boundary travel movements will be lowerthan the previous February 2021 Alert Level 3/2 boundary (noting that freightowill be lower and light vehicle movements a lot lower due to Alert Level 3/4restrictions):r79.1At Auckland southern SH1/SH2 boundary during the FebruaryPresurgence, there were around 3,700 freight movements each way perday, and around 6,000 light vehicles through the checkpoints in eachdirection daily.79.2 At the Auckland northern SH1 boundary, during the February 2021resurgence, there were around 600 freight movements and 1,500 lightvehicles through the checkpoints in each direction daily.169xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVESupply chain issues at Alert Level 480 Officials are aware of increasing supply chain impacts caused by the currentAlert Level 4 restrictions; these impacts will compound the longer that AlertLevel 4 continues. Although all freight can move, apart from businesses thatare allowed to operate at Alert Level 4, this is only for goods that are alreadydwithin the freight system (ie. in a shipping container, at a port, on a train, packedand in a distribution centre, etc). Many businesses are now no longeregenerating “new freight” because they are not allowed to operate; this includesany production or manufacturing not related to food and beverage or healthproducts. s81 The number of exports entering the freight system is starting tao diminish, andas time goes on this will cause increasing imbalances at ports and could resultin ships skipping port calls because of insufficient exportse to be picked up.s9(2)(b)(ii)l82 If ships start to reduce their calls to New Zealand because of insufficient exportseto justify their trips here, that will impact the flow of the other essential goodswe need. Given that we are already coping with a challenging situation causedRby international supply chain disruption, any additional impacts will bemagnified.83 The interagency supply chain group that has met regularly since March 2020 isycontinuing to meet. It shares information across the dozen or so agenciesrepresented and monitors the situation closely with a view to providing advicelto Ministers if required.eSupply chain issues for non-essential goodsv84 At Alert Level 4, businesses and services which sell essential non-foodconsumer products can have staff on site to process orders for onlineidelivery. If ptart of New Zealand moves to Alert Level 3, this would mean thatbusinesses or services outside the Alert Level 4 area can have staff on site tocprocess orders of any goods for online delivery (i.e. not just essential goods).a85 Officials have considered whether the distinction between essential and non-essential goods should be maintained when different parts of the country are atodifferentalert levels. Officials’ view is that the better approach is to retain therequirement that within an Alert Level 4 area people can only leave home torworkfor a business or service providing online delivery of essential non-foodP goods (rather than any goods). Retaining the requirement that the goods areessential is consistent with the desire to reduce movement within an AlertLevel 4 area.86 Concerns have been raised about possible impacts of having parts of thesupply chain in Alert Level 4, thereby hindering activity in Alert Level 3 areas.The most obvious pinch point would be construction and engineering, as manyconstruction products are made in Auckland, such as plasterboards andinsulation. Where construction material cannot be reasonably source to supportactivity that could otherwise occur elsewhere in the country, or reducedproduction would restrict activity over coming months by depleting material179xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVEstock I expect that firms would apply for exemptions to be considered by theDirector-General.Alert Level 3 settings87 The key differences between Alert Level 4 and Alert Level 3 settings are that atdAlert Level 3:87.1 everyone can go to work at a workplace operating with Alert Leveel 3requirements;s87.2 all retail and takeaways can operate with contactless pick up;a87.3 schools are open for years 1-10 for those who need it (caregivers areencouraged to continue distance learning where possible);e87.4 controlled gatherings of 10 people are permitted for weddings, civilunions, funeral and tangihanga; le87.5 there is some additional personal movement allowed – e.g. relocation ofhomes and visiting someone in residRential disability care; and87.6 bubbles can be extended for the purposes of keeping connections withfamily and whānau, caregivin g or preventing isolated people from beingalone, and bubbles can bey two or more houses.88 Officials reviewed the existinlg Alert Level 3 settings in light of the Delta variantand determined that the eexisting rules, coupled with the recent introduction ofadditional mandatory record keeping and face coverings requirements, arelargely appropriate to manage the increased risk posed by the Delta variant.vHowever, they have recommended three changes be made to Alert Level 3settings:it88.0 changing the public health risk description of Alert Level 3 to bettercreflect the situation that merits a step-down to Alert Level 3, to “Mediumrisk of community transmission – active but managed clusters”; anda88.1 an amendment to the face covering requirements, to include click andocollect delivery drivers; andr88.2 reducing classroom bubble sizes to 10 people, which is consistent withlimits on gatherings at Alert Level 3.P89Record keeping obligations will be included in any Order that moves any partof New Zealand to a lower alert level and the obligations will come into forceseven days after commencement of the rest of the Order. The Order will alsorequire delivery drivers to wear face coverings when delivering to residentialdwellings. Rather than specify classroom bubble sizes in the Order, Ministry ofEducation guidance will be that bubbles should have an upper limit of 10 peoplein educational entities that are able to be open at Alert Level 3.189xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVE94 Under initial Alert Level scenarios and associated estimated uptake, theRSPAUG21 was estimated to cost $600 million, though officials recognised thata more severe public health situation requiring prolonged periods at Alert Levelswould push costs beyond that figure.95 Given the public health outlook and implications of high uptake in the initial days dof opening, the current appropriation limit is likely to be insufficient to meet thecosts of the RSPAUG21. The additional funding needed is anticipated toe be$300 million, allowing for a total cost of the RSPAUG21 scheme of up to $899.9million. This assumes two weeks of Alert Level 4 nationwide and the largesmajority of uptake to occur during that period.a96 This paper therefore seeks further funding decisions from Cabinet in order tomeet updated expectations of the total cost of the RSP, as well aseauthorisations for Joint Ministers to draw down on the CRRF if costs escalatebeyond estimates again, up to a cap of $100 million.lLegislative Implications e97 I will make an Order under section 11 of the COVID-19 Public Health ResponseRAct 2020 informed by Cabinet’s decision.98 Before making a replacement Order or amending an Order, I must have regardto any advice from the Director-General about the risks of the outbreak oryspread of COVID-19, and the nature and extent of any measures that areappropriate to address those risks.

Where practicable, boundaries shouldbe implemented in coordination with iwi and hapū, who can advise on localecircumstances.3 With continued lock downs at level 4, it will be inlcreasingly difficult to meetwhānau wellbeing needs, as other second-wavee needs become apparent.Regional reports indicate that iwi, hapū, providers and commissioning agenciesare actively working to provide access toR material essentials by providingemergency supplies to hard-to-reach whānau, connecting whānau togovernment supports such as wage subsidy and vaccination services, andsupporting cultural safety and wel lbeing, for example through tangihangaguidance or temporary adaptive pyractices.4 However, areas of emergingl concern include:e4.1 Economic – lockdown extensions will impact on the ability of small Māoribusinesses to sustain themselves into lower alert levels due to low cashvreserves. For example, Māori SME in the construction and infrastructuresector will face project delays that affect cash-flow, negatively impactingiearly tmomentum created through the government’s investmentinfrastructure and pursuit of progressive procurement policies.c4.2 Mental health – emerging concerns around mental health and are awareaofthe potential for self-harm incidents (especially of rangatahi whoexperience higher rates of self-harm and suicide).

Other emerging issueseinclude a significant increase in reported mental health issues,particularly among young people, and increased racial discriminationRtargeted towards Pacific peoples which is linked to the large outbreakamong the Pacific community in South Auckland.7.2 Pacific peoples have the lowest vaccination rates which is linked to someychurch leaders to date struggling to lead their congregations to bevaccinated due to religious beliefs. 106,302 people have received theirlfirst vaccination dose and 64,061 have received their second (as ofe1.00pm 24 August 2021).107.3 Pacific peoplevs account for over 50% of the current Covid-19 cases, withthe Māngere Assembly of God Church (AOG) of Samoa presenting asthe largeist sub cluster of this outbreak following a service attended byt500 people last week.c7.4 Direct feedback from the community via Auckland Church Leaders ZoomaFono, notes emerging and ongoing impacts related to self-isolationchallenges for larger intergenerational families, challenges meeting theo criteria to access support (e.g. food parcels, financial support), andvaccination and testing stations requiring a booking.rDisabledPeopleP8The Office for Disability Issues has advised that for disabled people the currentissues requiring ongoing consideration are:8.1 access to food and essential services when these are not able to beaccessed independently – particularly as supermarket capacitybecomes compromised by closures and staff absences.10 https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics/covid-19-vaccine-data319xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVE8.2 improving communications regarding the flexible COVID testing andvaccination options available when disabled people have transportdifficulties and/or need adapted approaches.

REthnic Communities9 New Zealand’s ethnic communities make up roughly 20% of the population.About 60% of people from these cyommunities live in Auckland. As with previouslockdowns, there continue to be concerns around the loss of jobs, reducedhours, and the impact of finalnces of families. Challenges associated with digitaleconnectedness and a limited understanding of English can leave ethniccommunities highly socially vulnerable in the context of COVID-19, particularlyif they are not living vwith whānau as part of their bubble under Level 4. Withinethnic communities, there are a large number of self-employed or smallbusiness owneirs, and those who operate hospitality businesses which cannottoperate under AL4. Further, there have been reports that dairy owners hadreceived acbuse after enforcing new mask rules.10 Whilea the restrictions at Alert Level 3 are relatively similar to Alert Level 4, theability to have contactless pick-up and delivery and expand bubbles to includeoclose whanau and carers, or to support isolated people, will be beneficial formembers from ethnic communities. It will also allow funerals of up to 10 people,which has been a particularly challenging setting to navigate in Alert Level 4 forrethniccommunities.POlderpeople11 Organisations supporting older people have used their experience from lastyear to be able to quickly set up and operate/provide services remotely. Issuesthat will impact for a longer period of lockdown include:11.1 Accessing services that are online – this impacts on people who aredigitally excluded for whatever reason – for older people digital exclusionincreases with age, whilst some people still pay bills in person and will329xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVEbe impacted by the lockdown and not being able to pay their essentialservice bills (power, telephone etc).11.2 Food delivery services – with lockdown older people are encouraged toget others to do their shopping – this becomes problematic if they can’tgo online or aren’t able to get someone to assist them – sometimes dpayment becomes an issue (access to cash).e12 The difference between Alert Level 3 and 4 settings are not significant for olderpeople. Anxiety about how to keep themselves and others safe will continue tosbe high due to the virulent nature of the Delta strain. These increased levels ofanxiety are reported to be putting demands on providers that specialise inaproviding support to older people and officials predict that demand for theseservices/support will remain high.e13 There is a need to ensure that older people who are yet to be vaccinated arebeing proactively contacted, starting with the oldelst cohorts. The longer weremain at AL 3 or 4 the more difficult it becomese for older people to resumenormal activities with confidence.RYoung people14 As reported in the last Alert Level Review paper, we have seen a significantsurge in support being sought by young people in relation to their mental andygeneral wellbeing. Temporary funding has been allocated to Youthline to allowthem to cope with the significant increase in demand they are experiencing forlsupport from young people.evitcaorP339xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SENSITIVEAppendix 4 – Map of possible Auckland and Northland Alert Level 4 areadesaeleRylevitcaorP349xf54yo3ur 2021-10-21 15:49:43SE NS I TIV ECAB-21-MIN-0344CabinetMinute of DecisiondThis document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

I signalled on Friday that if Alert Level 4 wereehaving a significant impact on reducing transmission (i.e. comparable to AlertLevel 4 in 2020), then modelling suggests that case numbers would peak andvbegin flattening over the weekend. As at 9am, Monday 30 August, there are562 confirmed cases, all but 15 of which are in Auckland.it4 The proportion of cases who are household contacts of known cases has beencincreasing steadily and an increasing proportion of cases had no exposureevents in the community while infectious.a5 Testing and contact tracing capability have expanded significantly. 259,218otests were processed in the last seven days and there are no unexpectedwastewater testing results to report. Contact tracing capacity is stretched butrsufficient to manage the expected increase in daily cases.P6In his interim public health advice, the Director-General of Health considers thatthe risk in Auckland and Northland remains high, with wider communitytransmission not ruled out. He considers the risk across the rest of New Zealandto be medium, and that the Wellington cluster is contained. He has maderecommendations that align with this advice i.e. to keep Northland at Alert Level4 for a further week, Auckland at Alert Level 4 for two weeks, and to move therest of the country down to Alert Level 3, with a review on Monday 6 September.7 On the basis of this advice, I propose that Cabinet agrees to:19xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE7.0 Keep Auckland at Alert Level 4 until at least 11.59pm, Tuesday 14September.7.1 Keep Northland at Alert Level 4 until at least 11.59pm, Tuesday 7September, unless there is evidence to support a move to Alert Level 3sooner. COVID-19 Group Ministers with power to act could be delegated dthis decision.e7.2 Move all New Zealand south of Auckland to Alert Level 3 from 11.59pm,Tuesday 31 August.s8 It is important that when parts of the country are ready to move to Alert Level 3asufficient time is allowed to implement a land-based Alert Level boundary sothat it is safe, effective and achieves its purpose – to restrict movement toprevent the transmission of the virus. I am advised that weork to implement theAlert Level 4/3 boundary is underway by Police and checkpoints will beestablished on Tuesday 31 August. Police will alsol support AVSEC in checksat airports. MBIE has activated the Business Teravel Document register tosupport Police enforcement.R9 The impacts of higher Alert Levels intensify as the period these restrictions arein place endures. Although higher Alert Levels assist in preventing communitytransmission in more vulnerable com munities, they disproportionately impactsome groups. y10 Engagement with Northland leaders, including iwi, shows reduced support forlNorthland remaining at eAlert Level 4 especially considering no knowncommunity transmission there. They also reported declining resilience in someMāori communities and increasing demand for food and housing support.v11 There are issues that will require further work ahead of the next Alert Levelireview on Monday 6 September. These include preparation for multiple AlerttLevel boundaries (4/3/2), monitoring compliance at checkpoints and airports,cconsidering further protocols for those who travel between Alert Level areas,and considering strengthening workplace protocols at Alert Levels 4 and 3.aHow we make Alert Level decisionso12 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-rMIN-0387refer]:P12.0 the Director-General of Health’s satisfaction on four health matters:12.0.0 the source of the case(s) or outbreak (noting new variants ofconcern), and the number and geographical distribution ofclusters;12.0.1 the length of time the virus has been in the community and thepotential for undetected transmission (i.e. between the sourceand the case);29xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE12.0.2 the containment of the case(s) and/or cluster(s), includingconsideration of the potential for undetected communitytransmission occurring in New Zealand or in quarantine-freetravel countries;12.0.3 the capacity and capability of our public health systems, dincluding our surveillance and contact tracing systems;e12.1 evidence of the effects of the measures on the economy and societymore broadly;s12.2 evidence of the impacts of the measures for at risk populations inaparticular;12.3 public attitudes towards the measures and the exetent to which peopleand businesses understand, accept, and abide by them; andl12.4 our ability to operationalise the restricetions, including satisfactoryimplementation planning.R13 This approach is underpinned by the Elimination Strategy and supports NewZealand’s vaccine roll-out, which in turn will support the Reconnecting NewZealanders approach to opening our borders next year when it is safe to do so.yThe current response14 At 11.59pm, Tuesday 17 Auglust 2021, all New Zealand moved to Alert Level 4[CAB-21-MIN-0324 refers]e.15 On Friday 20 August, Cabinet agreed to keep all New Zealand at Alert Level 4vuntil at least 11.59pm, Tuesday 24 August [CAB-21-MIN-0330 refers].i16 On Monday 23 August, Cabinet agreed to extend Alert Level 4 for Aucklandtuntil 11.59 pm, Tuesday, 31 August, and agreed to extend Alert Level 4 for thecrest of New Zealand until 11.59 pm, Friday, 27 August [CAB-21-MIN-0336refers].a17 On Friday 27 August, Cabinet agreed to keep all New Zealand at Alert Level 4ountilat least 11.59pm, Tuesday, 31 August 2021. Cabinet noted that it isanticipated that all of New Zealand, except Auckland and Northland, will moverdown to Alert Level 3 for at least one week from 11.59pm, Tuesday 31 AugustP 2021, should the public health risk advice support this [CAB-21-MIN-0344refers]. At Friday’s post-Cabinet media briefing, the Prime Minster signalled thatAuckland is expected to remain at Alert Level 4 for a further two weeks, subjectto public health advice.Situation report18 As at 9am Monday 30 August, there are 562 confirmed cases. 547 are inAuckland and 15 in Wellington. All except one of the new positive cases sinceCabinet’s review of Alert Level settings on Friday have been in Auckland. Thenew Wellington case was already in a MIQF as a household contact of anexisting case.39xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE19 The outbreak is continuing to grow in Auckland, and it is difficult to determinewhether the number of cases have peaked but the numbers are notincreasing exponentially. However, the following trends across the country areencouraging:19.0 the proportion of cases who are household contacts of known cases dhas been steadily increasing since 23 August,19.1 in the 24 hours to 9am 28 August, over 70 percent of cases had no eexposure events in the community while infectious,s19.2 there has been a decreasing number of new exposure eventscreated by new cases since 17 August,a19.3 there has been a decreasing number of contacts whose exposuredate was in the last seven days,e19.4 in the Auckland region 99 percent of contacts have been reachedand 90 percent have had at least one test, anlde19.5 in Northland, 100 percent of contacts have been reached and 89percent have had at least one test.R20 The Director-General has identified the need for vigilance to preventtransmission between essential workers. As at 2pm, Sunday 29 August 95cases are essential workers, and wh ile many of these are incidental (i.e. theywere not infected at work but as part of community clusters), further analysis isyneeded. In the meantime permitted essential movement and business activitiesshould remain limited to work critical for life necessities, and the Director-lGeneral suggests reiteerating communications messages around theimportance of all essential workers continuing to follow strict InfectionPrevention and Control processes (e.g. wear PPE, practice physical distancing,vcough and hand hygiene etc).iUpdated modelling in relation to the current outbreaktc21 Modelling results are broadly similar to the update provided in the previous AlertLevel Review Cabinet Paper on Friday:a21.0 Size of cluster at detection: Estimates for the size of the cluster at theo point of detection suggest that there may have been up to 250 - 300infected individuals. This is a large estimated range, reflective of ther uncertainty in estimating transmission when there are low numbers ofcases.P21.1 Impacts of Alert Level 4: While it is still too early to accurately estimatethe impacts of Alert Level 4 on transmission – in particular, whether thereproductive number in Alert Level 4 is just above or just below 1 – thereare positive indications. The following discussion is therefore indicativeat this stage. If Alert Level 4 restrictions, contact tracing, and casemanagement measures are reducing transmission similarly to the 2020Alert Level 4, modelling results suggest that daily reported cases willbegin to flatten and taper over the course of this week.49xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE21.2 At this early stage, it is difficult to estimate when new cases may reducebelow ten per day, with modelling results giving a range from mid-September to mid-October. In a more pessimistic scenario where AlertLevel 4 is insufficient to reduce the reproductive number below one,modelled case numbers are not likely to dramatically reduce in the near-term. d21.3 As more data for transmission during Alert Level 4 becomes availaeble,modelling results will give a better sense of how the transmissiondynamics of this cluster may evolve in different scenarios.s21.4 Chance of undetected cases outside of Auckland: Estimates for theaprobability that we would have detected any new cases (if they existed)outside of Auckland and Wellington through wastewater and communityetesting suggest that there is around a 60-70% chance that cases aredetected, or transmission “fizzles out”, by today (Monday 30 August).These estimates are sensitive to the catchlment area of wastewateresurveillance and the proportion of the symptomatic population beingtested (where smaller, and higher, respectively, improve probability ofdetection). RDirector-General of Health’s interim assessment against the health factorsSource of the case(s)/outbreaky22 Source investigation is ongoing into direct link(s) between the source case andthe community cluster, howelver the chain of transmission that was consideredto be most likely (via a MIeQ worker who was briefly present on the same flooras the returnee who is considered the source case in the Crowne Plaza on 8August 2021) has novw been ruled out. All the available evidence points towardsthis source case but the exact chain of transmission has not been establishedand may neveri be.tUpdate on outbreak sub-clustersc23 There are currently seven epidemiologically-linked sub-clusters identified withinathis outbreak. As at 2pm 29 August, he two largest clusters are:o23.0a cluster associated with the AOG church in Mangere (261confirmed cases), andr23.1the Birkdale Social Network cluster associated with Case A (73Pconfirmed cases).24 The other clusters have 30 or fewer people associated with each of them.Length of time the virus has been in the community25 The initial detection of the outbreak discussed at paragraph 22 above was apositive result on 17 August. This suggests that the virus was circulating in thecommunity for a period of at least ten days prior to detection.59xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEPotential for undetected community transmission26 The Director-General considers that the risk in Auckland and Northland remainshigh, with wider community transmission not ruled out. However, he considersthe risk across the rest of New Zealand to be medium and has a high degree ofconfidence that the cluster in Wellington is contained. After the index cases indWellington were identified, all subsequent cases south of Auckland have beenidentified in close plus contacts (10) and in two close contacts. All recent casesehave been in quarantine, including the most recent case detected on Saturday28 August. The last time a case was infectious in the community was Friday 20August. s27 In the Auckland region, the large part of ongoing transmiassion is withinhouseholds. However, there is evidence of transmission from locations ofinterest. There are a number of essential workers who aree infected (95 casesas at 2pm, Sunday 29 August), who may be attending work during theirinfectious period. The Director-General does not at this stage have confidencelthat the edges of the outbreak have been detecteed.Health system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systemsR28 As at 29 August, there were 35 hospitalised cases, with three in intensive care.29 The Ministry of Health's National PP E and Critical Medical Supply Chain hasgood stocks of PPE, with at leasyt a month's reserves to meet high pandemicdemand. In addition, the Ministry continues to confirm orders and receiveshipments of more PPE evelry week. While there are freight delays that arecurrently being widely reeported, the Ministry is working with governmentpartners to minimise impact from this.v30 Since Tuesday 17 August 2021, over 34 million items of PPE have beendistributed for use in the health and disability sector. PPE demand is expectedito drop back tover the next week as it is expected that initial demand involved alot of overc-ordering.31 The Ministry’s national PPE supply chain currently holds close to 17 millionaN95/P2 particulate respirators, 274 million medical masks, 16 million isolationgowns, 1.5 million face shields, 271 million nitrile gloves, and good volumes ofohandsanitiser, disinfectant wipes and other items of PPE utilised across thehealth and disability sector.rP32The total number of tests processed over the last seven days was 259,218 (arolling 7-day average of 37,031 per day). Of the 514 South Island contactsidentified as at 4pm Sunday 29 August, 100% have been contacted and areself-isolating. Of these 514 contacts, 476 (92%) test results have beenreturned , all of which have been negative (33 results are overdue). Of the3,355 contacts identified in relation to community cases in the Wellingtonregion, 2,812 (83%) have been contacted and are self-isolating. Of these 3,355contacts, 3,088 (92%) test results have been returned, with 12 positives (0.4%)and 3,076 (91%) negative (213 results are overdue).69xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE33 There are no unexpected wastewater detections to report. A positive result wasdetected in a single point-in-time ‘grab’ sample from Warkworth on 27 August,after wastewater detections on 17, 22, and 24 August. Following the detectionof COVID-19 in samples collected from Christchurch on 21, 23, and 25 August(likely linked to contained cases in managed isolation), grab samples werecollected from 5 pumpstations on 26 August. COVID-19 was not detected in dany of those samples.e34 As at 5.30pm Sunday 29 August, 33,365 contacts have been identified. Ofthese 33,365 contacts, 27,333 (81%) have been contacted and are self-sisolating; 28,648 (85%) have returned test results, with 343 (1%) of these beingpositive and 28,305 (84%) being negative. Of these 33,365 contacts, 842 areaclose plus contacts. Of these 842 close plus contacts, 745 (88%) have beencontacted and 638 (75%) have returned test results – 226 (26.8%) positive ande412 (48%) negative.35 Contact tracing capacity is sufficient to manage the expected increase in dailylcases. NITC has activated all the surge capacity freom PHUs across the countryto manage cases and contacts. Surge capacity in call centres has beenactivated and additional capacity has been activated through all of governmentRcall centres and an additional private provider. As at 29 August, there is capacityacross the whole system. Although we are still seeing around 1,000 newcontacts being identified per day, t he number of new contacts identified isreducing as the impacts of Alert Level 4 take effect.y36 As at 29 August 2021, there are 3,101,884 registered NZ COVID Tracer applusers, and 669,537 scans in the previous 24 hours. As at 30 August 2021,e1,939,501 people had Bluetooth tracing activated.vDirector-General’s conclusionsi37 The Director-General considers that, although the number of new cases intAuckland continues to increase slowly, growth is not exponential and appearsclikely to plateau in the next 4-5 days. The proportion of cases identified ashousehold links is increasing, but cases from community contacts remain.a38 There is evidence of transmission between essential workers in Auckland inosome cases, suggesting that essential movement should still be limited.39 Before considering recommending that Auckland move to Alert Level 3 therDirector-General will consider testing numbers, wastewater results, andPconfirmation that known and emerging cases have been isolating.40 Despite no cases being detected in Northland, concerns remain about theworkplace contacts of the Warkworth household cases. Before consideringrecommending that Northland move to Alert Level 3 the Director-Generalwould need more information to determine that community transmission is notoccurring, particularly on contact tracing for the Warkworth cluster andwastewater testing results.41 The Director-General considers the Wellington cluster to be contained, with allcases linked, and none infectious in the community since 20 August.79xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEProposal42 The Director-General’s interim public health advice is therefore that:42.0 Auckland remain at Alert Level 4 for at least two further weeks, with areview on 5 September 2021, for Cabinet consideration on 6 Septemberd2021;42.1 Northland remain at Alert Level 4, to be reviewed on 5 Septembeer forCabinet consideration on 6 September 2021, with a view to move to AlertLevel 3, unless evidence (including contact tracing for the Warkworthscluster and wastewater testing results) emerges to enable an earliermove; anda42.2 The rest of New Zealand shift to Alert Level 3 at 11:59pm on Tuesdaye31 August 2021, with a review on 5 September, for Cabinetconsideration on 6 September 2021.le43 On the basis of the most recent public health risk assessment, the Director-General considers that the risk in Auckland and Northland remains high. Headvises that given the information and testR results received to date, and thecurrent sub-cluster in Warkworth, wider community transmission cannot beruled out in Auckland or Northland. At this point, the data suggest that at leastanother two weeks is required at Ale rt Level 4 in Auckland to be confident thatthe outbreak is contained. Furthyer testing and continued negative results inwastewater samples in Warkworth and in Northland are needed to be morecertain that there is no undeltected community transmission in Northland.e44 The Director-General considers the risk across the rest of New Zealand to bemedium. There is nvo indication of any transmission outside of Auckland andWellington. While cases continue to grow, all but one of the recent cases (anindividual who itested positive while in isolation in Wellington) are located inAuckland. Oftficials have gathered a reasonable level of evidence regarding theparametercs of this outbreak, and I have confidence that the outbreak is largelycontained outside of Auckland.a45 Therefore, I propose that Cabinet agrees to keep Northland at Alert Level 4 untilat least 11.59pm, Tuesday 7 September and Auckland at Alert Level 4 until atoleast11.59pm, Tuesday 14 September. As indicated on Friday 27 August, Irecommend Cabinet agrees to move all New Zealand south of Auckland to AlertrLevel3 from 11.59pm, Tuesday 31 August. I propose these settings are allP reviewed on Monday, 6 September.46 There is also an option to move Northland to Alert Level 3 before Tuesday 7September, if the public health advice supports this. Planning to implement theAlert Level 4/3 boundary has considered this possibility and although aboundary north of Auckland would require additional Police checkpoints andresource, it could be implemented within 24 hours of today’s decision. Cabinetcould delegate COVID-19 Group Ministers authority to agree to shift Northlandout of Alert 4 sooner, subject to updated public health advice and furtherwastewater and community testing over the coming days.89xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEAssessment of the proposed measures/options against the non-health factors47 I have assessed the proposal to keep Auckland and Northland at Alert Level 4and move the rest of the country to Alert Level 3, against the non-health factorsagreed by Cabinet, as set out below.d48 My assessment confirms my proposal. We knew the negative impacts of higherAlert Levels would be exacerbated as the length of time the restrictions are ineplace endures. Social and community based services are working hard to keepup with demand, but I remain concerned about increasing mental wellbeingsimpacts, reports of discrimination and demand on essential supplies (e.g. foodand shelter). Significant Police resource will be required to enforce the AlertaLevel 4/3 boundary and to manage the expected influx of people on the roadsand at stores following a move to Alert Level 3. Increased complianceemonitoring may lead to a spike in the number of non-compliance notificationsover the coming week.lEconomic impacts from Alert Levels e49 The Treasury’s assessment of the economic impacts of different Alert LevelRsettings was provided in the Alert Level review Cabinet Paper of Friday27 August. Domestic and international economic data since the emergence ofthe pandemic continues to back our st rategy that a strong public health responsehas been the best economic response.yImpacts on at risk populationsl50. The impacts of higher Alerte Levels (Alert Levels 3 and 4) intensify as the periodthese restrictions are in place endures. Although higher Alert Levels assist inpreventing communitvy transmission in more vulnerable communities, theydisproportionately impact some groups. The impacts on at risk populations areset out in more dietail in Appendix 2, and include (but are not limited to):t50.1 resctrictions on earning capacity (e.g. loss of jobs, reduced hours, and theimpact of finances of families) which can amplify income and povertyainequities;50.2 concerns around vaccination eligibility (e.g. large proportions of someopopulations only recently becoming eligible) and inequitable access totesting stations;rP50.3challenges associated with digital connectedness, and inequitableaccess to essential50.4 services and material essentials such as food, hygiene products, shelterand warmth.50.5 ongoing concerns around mental health, with support servicesexperiencing a significant surge in support being sought by communitiesin relation to their mental and general wellbeing;99xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE50.6 Increased racial discrimination, particularly heightened toward Pacificpeoples due to increasing Pacific cases and Alert Level extensions; and50.7 challenges self-isolating, particularly for larger intergenerational families.51 MSD, NEMA and social service providers will continue to work with dcommunities and provide consistent messaging about the supports already inplace and how to utilise existing support channels.ePublic attitudes and compliances52 Themes emerging through public social media channels, including UniteAgainst COVID-19, on Friday 27 August include more conversaation about theduration of Alert Level settings, with high neutral and negative sentiment aroundduration of settings (particularly in the South Island). People displaced by theeoriginal lockdown on 17 August are eager to return home and believe they willbe able to do so from Wednesday. Sentiment in the enforcement category islstill mainly neutral, with moderate negative sentiment related to increasedeconcern about enforcement of Alert Level boundaries.53 Engagement (including some on Friday, folRlowing the most recent Alert Levelannouncements) with local Northland leaders, including iwi, on proposals tokeep Northland at Alert Level 4 with Auckland, has demonstrated:53.0 reduced support for Northland being at the same Alert Level asyAuckland, with some more concerned about Northland remaining at AlertLevel 4 especially considering no known community transmission there;le53.1 clear emphasis on communicating the public health rationale for higherAlert Level restrictions;v53.2 general support for the northern and southern boundary definition;i53.3 declinting resilience in some Māori communities;c53.4 increasing demand for food and housing support.a54 By 5pm Saturday, 28 August, Police had received a total of 11,816 onlinebreach notifications through its 105 system (an increase of 1,844 notificationsosinceThursday 26 August), with 3,997 relating to breaches in Auckland. Since17 August Police have conducted 39,296 COVID-19 related activities andrissued1,829 infringements (the majority for people failing to remain at home).P There are continued reports of protests, with a handful planned on 31 August.Police advise that public sentiment is mixed following Friday’s Alert Levelannouncement, with some (particularly in the South Island) disappointed withthe decision to keep the country at Alert Level 4 and others defending thisdecision.55 In line with predictions based on experience from the 2020 lockdown, there wassome non-compliance with mass gatherings observed over the weekend, andthis is expected to increase when parts of the country move to Alert Level 3.Police have increased their presence in Northland and Auckland as it is109xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEanticipated people will attempt to leave these areas prior to Alert Level 4/3boundary checkpoints being established.Ability to operationalise the proposals in this paper56. There are a number of operational implications of keeping some parts of thedcountry at Alert Level 4, and moving the rest of the country to Alert Level 3. Theseinclude:e56.1. Implementation of the Alert Level 4/3 boundary (discussed below inparagraphs 63-66). s56.2. Continued social and community-based support provisions, particularlyaas demand rises while lockdown restrictions continue. Officials advisethat social and community-based services will continue to provideesupport to New Zealanders, including for housing, support for disabledpeople to maintain critical wellbeing and crisis support for people wholare unsafe. Various economic supports (suech as the Wage Subsidy andResurgence Support Payment) also continue to be available.R56.3. Monitoring compliance of permissions to travel at airports. AviationSecurity (who are not enforcement officers) are undertaking checks atmain airport entryways, or before departure gates. Police will providereassurance patrols and respond to any calls for support in dealing withydisturbances or instances of non-compliance.l56.4. The Ministry of Health is receiving and processing several hundrederequests a day for exemptions from the Alert Level 4 Order. Theseexemptions are being sought for a variety of reasons including movingvhouse, visiting relatives, care for animals and attending funerals. We arealso seeing a significant number of requests from people who shelterediin placte during Alert Level 4 who wish to return home for reasons suchas fcinancial hardship, mental wellbeing, and reuniting with their families.Alert Levela 4/3 boundary and permitted purposes for travel57 To implement a regional boundary around Auckland and Northland, I proposeothat the southern Alert Level 3/2 boundary used in February 2021 (includingPort Waikato and parts of the northern Waikato) be used again for the AlertrLevel 4/3 boundary. A map of this area is attached in Appendix 1.PAnAlert Level 4/3 boundary should restrict movement as much as possible58 The fundamental public health premise is that under both Alert Levels 3 and 4,people should stay home, unless it is essential to do otherwise. At higher AlertLevels, travel between Alert Level areas creates an even greater risk of thevirus spreading to other regions. An Alert Level 4/3 boundary should thereforebe tighter, in terms of permitted movement, than previous boundaries created.119xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVECabinet has agreed to the permissions for movement across the Alert Level 4/3boundary for work and non-work purposesd59 On Friday 27 August, Cabinet agreed to the permissions for movement acrossthe Alert Level 4/3 boundary for work and non-work purposes [CAB-21-MIN-e0344 refers]. It was agreed that the same categories of workers that can travelwithin the current Alert Level 4 area will be permitted to move from one AlertLevel area to another. Cabinet also agreed to a limited number of pesrmissionsfor individuals to cross the boundary for non-work purposes, for example toprovide urgent care for a child or attend a medical appointmenta.60 In addition to these permissions, exemptions for travel across the Alert Levele4/3 boundary can also be granted by the Director-General of Health of Health(including for compassionate reasons). Appendix 3 outlines the work and non-lwork permissions agreed by Cabinet in further detail.e61 In practice, these decisions mean that travel through different Alert Levels willRbe allowed if the person is travelling to undertake essential personal movementpermitted by the Order (e.g. to do necessary work), or because they havereceived an exemption from the Order’s restrictions on movement from theDirector-General of Health (e.g. on compassionate grounds). The personytravelling through different Alert Levels will, so far as is reasonably practicable,be required to travel directly without stopping. There will not be a specifiedl“corridor” limiting the person’s travel to a particular route.e62 Given the level of transmission we are seeing between essential workers, it isvimportant that the vaccination is made available to these workers and additionaltests are implemented where these workers are moving across the Alert Leveli4/3 boundary. Employees of Alert Level 4 businesses and services who interacttwith customers, as well as transport and logistic services, are now eligible tocreceive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible. DHBs are working directlywith employers of these workers to organise vaccinations e.g. providingabooking access codes for essential workers in larger workplaces to give theseworkers preferential access to DHB reserve lists. Other Alert Level 4 businessoand service employees are being prioritised.r63 I am advised that officials are also assessing the risk associated with Alert Level4 businesses and services who regularly traverse the country as part of ourPsupply chain (including long-haul truck drivers), in light of Delta. Officials areconsidering whether any additional risk mitigation measures are recommended,in addition to the protections already provided by Alert Level 4 and 3 facecovering, physical distancing and personal movement requirements.Business Travel Documents can support Police enforcement at checkpoints64 The Order specifies when people are required to carry evidence of the purposeof their travel from one Alert Level Area to another, including for work.129xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE65 MBIE has activated the Business Travel Document (BTD) register to supportPolice enforcement of the requirement for evidence at the Alert Level 4/3boundary for businesses or services where travel across the boundary ispermitted. This system significantly increases the efficient management ofvehicles through checkpoints.d66 As at 8pm Sunday 29 August, 818 companies had been issued Business TravelDocuments, enabling 5,021 to cross the Alert Level 4/3 boundary. Transeport(1,830 workers) and Primary Sector (1,447 workers) documents currently makeup the largest shares of issuance.s67 MBIE has confirmed that the BTD system will continue to auto-process mostarequests under an Alert Level 4/3 boundary. To mitigate the risk of BTDs beingissued to businesses whose workers should not be travelling, sector leadeagencies will increase their monitoring activities.Implementation of an Alert Level 4/3 boundary le68 Police is working to implement the Alert Level 4/3 boundary south of Auckland.The Alert Level 4/3 boundary requires checkpoints to be established at fiveRfixed locations, with one roving checkpoint team, to cover the rural areas in thewest for the southern boundary. If a boundary were established to the north ofAuckland, a further five fixed checkpoint locations would be required.y69 Police estimates 24/7 coverage will require 210 staff for the southern boundary(and 150 staff for a potential northern boundary), assuming 50 NZDF staff arelavailable over each 24-hour period, confirmation of which will be received fromeNZDF this afternoon (30 August). As checkpoints are established, Policeintends to work with Iwi to establish a partnership approach to their ongoingvoperation. Police note that the proposed permissions for cross-boundary travelacross an Alert Level 4/3 boundary will result in lower traffic flows than previousiAlert Level 3/2 boundaries.t70 Since Fricday 27 August, Police has stepped up the establishment ofcheckpoints around the country to minimise unauthorised travel. Generally,acompliance is good. Early anecdotal evidence suggests the most commonreason to travel without authority is for shopping, sometimes to avoid busy localosupermarkets.71 Police will establish the southern boundary checkpoints during daylight hoursronTuesday 31 August for safety reasons and to minimise any final movementPof people from Auckland and Northland to lower Alert Level areas in the finalhours prior to the Order coming into force. These will be regular Alert Level 4checkpoints until 11.59pm when the boundary becomes lawful. From that point,evidence of authorisation to travel will be checked.Alert Level 3 settings72 As indicated on Friday 27 August, Alert Level 3 settings continue to be largelyfit for purpose for the Delta variant. Cabinet has agreed to the following minorsettings adjustments [CAB-21-MIN-0344 refers]:139xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE72.0 the public health risk description of Alert Level 3 will be changed to betterreflect the situation that merits a step-down to Alert Level 3, to “Mediumrisk of community transmission – active but managed clusters”.72.1 The mandatory face covering requirements will be extended to includedelivery drivers going to residential addresses. d72.2 Classroom bubble sizes will be reduced to 10 people, which is consistentewith limits on gatherings at Alert Level 3.s73 The mandatory record keeping obligations Cabinet has previously agreed to[CAB-21-MIN-0315 and CAB-21-MIN-0330] will be included in the Orderamoving any part of New Zealand to a lower Alert Level. Obligations will comeinto force seven days after the Order’s commencement.eFurther work required ahead of next Alert Level reviewl74 Following decisions made as a result of this paper, there are issues that willerequire further work ahead of the next Alert Level review on Monday 6September. These are:R74.0 DPMC’s COVID-19 Response Unit will co-ordinate the preparation for apossible Alert Level 4 and Alert Level 2 boundary (or a combination AlertLevel 4/3/2 set of boundaries), including how this could beoperationalised, what pubylic health measures would be required, andhow compliance could be supported.le74.1 The Ministry of Health will co-ordinate the consideration of whetheradditional protocols, such as increased testing, are needed for thoserequired to trvavel from a higher Alert Level area to a lower Alert Levelarea for permitted business purposes (Health, Transport, MBIE andDPMC). iThere have already been some discussions around this.t74.2 Polcice will co-ordinate the monitoring of compliance with boundaryrequirements (if established) including at airports, and liaise with DPMCato assess the need for any change to settings (Police, MBIE, Transport,MPI and DPMC).o74.3The Ministry of Health will confirm whether infection prevention controlsfor businesses and services operating at Alert Levels 4 and 3 adequatelyrreflect the risks of Delta (Health, MBIE and DPMC).P74.4 The Ministry of Health will co-ordinate reviewing Alert Level 2 settings toreflect the risks of Delta, similar to the approach already taken to AlertLevels 4 and 3.74.5 DPMC will co-ordinate looking at options for tightening Alert Level 4settings and other measures to help reduce transmission further, withoutcausing further economic disruption and undermining compliance,should evidence show changes are required.149xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVEsecond payment is expected to be less than the first payment as a result of thechange in Alert levels (see the first scenario in the cost table above).79 Cabinet has delegated authority to Joint Ministers to draw down up to $2,200million from the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund for future paymentsunder the WSSAUG21 [CAB-21-MIN-0328 refers]. As at 28 August, the balance dof the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF) is $2.8 billion.4eResurgence Support Payment August 2021s80 Under initial Alert Level scenarios and associated estimated uptake, theRSPAUG21 was estimated to cost $600 million, though officials recognised thataa more severe public health situation requiring prolonged periods at Alert Levelswould push costs beyond that figure.e81 On 27 August, in response to the public health outlook and implications of highuptake in the initial days of opening, Cabinet agreled to increase the fundingavailable under the RSPAUG21 by $300 millione [CAB-21-MIN-0344 refers],raising the total value appropriated to $899.9 million. Cabinet also authorisedJoint Ministers to draw down on the CRRF Rif costs escalate beyond estimatesagain, up to a cap of $100 million.Legislative Implicationsy82 I will make an Order under section 11 of the COVID-19 Public Health ResponseAct 2020 informed by Cabinet’s decision.le83 Before making a replacement Order or amending an Order, I must have regardto any advice from the Director-General about the risks of the outbreak orspread of COVID-1v9, and the nature and extent of any measures that areappropriate to address those risks. I may also have regard to Cabinet’s decisionon the level of piublic health measures appropriate to respond to those risks andtavoid, mitigate, or remedy the effects of the outbreak or spread of COVID-19.c84 Ministerial consultation requirements will be satisfied through previousconsaultation on template Orders for Alert Level requirements and the proposalsoutlined in this and Friday’s Alert Level review paper.o85 The Act requires that there be 48 hours between publishing the Order and itscoming into force. However, this requirement does not apply where I amrsatisfiedthat the Order should come into force urgently to prevent or containPthe outbreak or spread of COVID-19, or when the effect of the order is only toremove or reduce requirements imposed by a COVID-19 order. For theproposals in this paper, I am satisfied that both circumstances would apply.86 I intend to make the new Order, informed by Cabinet’s decision, this evening,so it can be published 24 hours before it comes into force.4 This balance does not reflect the cost of any proposals considered at Cabinet on 27 August 2021.169xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEImpact Analysis87 The Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in this paper areexempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS)because they are intended to alleviate the short-term impacts of a declaredemergency event of COVID-19 outbreak.

This is because ofethe high trust and connections iwi and hapū have with communities, includingaccess to isolated communities and hard-to-reach whānau who are not beinglserved by mainstream services. Evidence shows that responses led by Māoriein connection with their communities will lead to stronger wellbeing outcomesfor whānau and embedding increased community resilience.R3 With continued lockdowns at Alert Level 4 and ongoing restrictions at AlertLevel 3, it will be increasingly difficult to meet whānau wellbeing needs, as othersecond-wave needs become appare nt. While iwi, hapū, providers and WhānauOra commissioning agencies arey already actively working to support whanau(for example providing access to material essentials), TPK’s regional reportingis revealing a strong sense lof uncertainty in Māori communities experiencingeincreased strains on their resources. In the Auckland and Northland areas inparticular, this includes households struggling to pay bills, community providersand NGOs running vlow on their operating funding, increasing strain on wateraccess (in Northland in particular, with 50% on reticulated supply), and so on.i4 Other areas tof emerging concern include:c4.1 Economic – lockdown extensions will impact on the ability of small Māoriabusinesses to sustain themselves into lower alert levels due to low cashreserves. For example, Māori SME in the construction and infrastructuresector will face project delays that affect cash-flow, negatively impactingoearly momentum created through the government’s investmentinfrastructure and pursuit of progressive procurement policies. Therconstruction sector was the top employment category for Māori inP Auckland and second in the Northland rohe in 2020.4.2 While nearly 40% of Māori authority businesses were fully operationalduring COVID-19 Alert Level 4 last year, this was almost double theproportion of Māori SMEs, and all New Zealand businesses. No Māoritourism businesses were fully operational under Alert Levels 4 or 3 lastyear. This flowed through to requests for support from government.Fewer than half of Māori authorities accessed government financialsupport during the lockdown periods of COVID-19, compared with more5 2018 Census.229xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEthan three-quarters of Māori SMEs, and over 90% of Māori tourismbusinesses. More than half of Māori tourism businesses also arrangedrent reductions or deferment, and postponed or cancelled plannedcapital investment. In general, Māori tourism businesses were morelikely than either Māori authorities or Māori SMEs to make changes totheir finances to help adapt to COVID-19 impacts. d4.3 Mental health – emerging concerns around mental health ande thepotential for self-harm incidents (especially of rangatahi who experiencehigher rates of self-harm and suicide). For example, 712 (65%) of thestotal applicants requiring material support from Te Pūtahitangacommissioning agency during the first six days of Level 4 lockdown (18-a23 August), mentioned and discussed lockdown impacts on mentalwellbeing. Financial stress, illness, relationship problems, highedeprivation, and lack of support were identified as the factors impactingwhānau mental hauora.le5 On this basis, support for locally-led responses, transparency, and providing asmuch certainty as possible are critical to helping communities constructivelysupport and plan for whānau and indiviRdual needs (as has been donethroughout planning of an Alert Level 4/3 boundary south of Auckland). Iwi andhapū involvement enables more targeted responses and communications towhānau that utilise the main Alert Level 4 guidance, but that is more tailored totheir audience. Iwi and hapū inyvolvement can also strengthen the currentgovernment response by ensuring whānau needs are identified across servicesand the relevant supports mlade available, including whānau who fail to qualifyefor specific services or supports for whatever reason.Pacific Peoples v6 A significant proportion of the Pacific population living in New Zealand live inithe Auckland region (more than 2/3rd). Pacific peoples currently account for athigh proportion of the total number of community cases across New Zealand.c7 Pacific peoples are more susceptible to the worst health effects of COVID-19aincluding hospitalisation and death, due to high rates of underlying healthconditions. High household overcrowding among Pacific peoples also presentsochallenges in terms of containing the spread of COVID-19 through self-isolation.r8The current outbreak and associated higher Alert Levels (i.e. Alert Level 3 andP4) impacts the Pacific population in the following ways:8.1 Higher Alert Level settings create restrictions on earning capacity whichcan amplify pre-existing income and poverty inequities. Pacific providersreport a surge in requests and referrals for support, especially foodparcels, with some reporting difficulties meeting demand. Extending theduration of higher Alert Levels further exacerbates current challengesfaced by Pacific families and communities to meet basic needs.8.2 Other emerging issues include a significant increase in reported mentalhealth issues, particularly among young people, and increased racial239xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEdiscrimination targeted towards Pacific peoples, which is linked to thelarge outbreak among the Pacific community in South Auckland. Theseissues can be expected to be heightened as a result of further Pacificcases and extended lockdown durations.8.3 Direct feedback from the community via the latest Auckland Church dLeaders Zoom Fono, notes the following emerging and ongoing impacts:e8.3.1 self-isolation challenges for larger intergenerational families,and language support needs for MIQ;s8.3.2 challenges to access support and/or know what is availablea(e.g. food parcels, financial support, education resources);8.3.3 overwhelming demand on community ande providers’ resourcesand funding, with some sources exhausted; andl8.3.4 access to vaccination and testinge stations.9 Pacific peoples have the overall lowest vaccination rates. Low vaccination ratesRcan be linked to a range of factors including low health literacy and associatedvulnerability to misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, digital exclusion, regionalisolation, and eligibility.y10 Low health literacy means that Pacific peoples are more likely to need supportto navigate the complexities of vaccination and will seek out this support fromltrusted community leaders. Church leaders, Pacific providers, and communityenavigators continue to be critical sources of trusted information fromgovernment into the community about keeping safe from COVID-19, and thevimportance of getting vaccinated.iEthnic Communitiest11 Ethnic comcmunities are feeling particularly vulnerable in this lockdown, due tothe combined effects of uncertainty due to broader policy changes inimmiagration (the inability to reunite with families and uncertain immigrationstatus for those on work and student visas) and lacking appropriate supportparticularly in mental health and wellbeing. This is despite filling an importantorolein the country’s response to COVID-19 as essential workers, and thecontribution to the economy.rP12New Zealand’s ethnic communities make up roughly 20% of the population.About 60% of people from these communities live in Auckland. As with previouslockdowns, there continue to be concerns around the loss of jobs, reducedhours, and the financial impact on families. Challenges associated with digitalconnectedness and a limited understanding of English can leave ethniccommunities, especially the elderly, highly socially vulnerable in the context ofCOVID-19, particularly if they are not living with whānau as part of their bubbleunder Alert Level 4. Within ethnic communities, there are many self-employedor small business owners, which cannot operate under Alert Level 4. Further,there have been reports that dairy owners have received racist abuse after249xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEenforcing new face covering requirements. There are also reports of increasingonline racism.13 While the restrictions at Alert Level 3 are relatively similar to Alert Level 4, theability to have contactless pick-up and delivery, and to expand bubbles, will bebeneficial. It will also allow funerals of up to 10 people, which has been a dparticularly challenging setting to navigate in Alert Level 4. The continuation ofAlert Level 4 in Auckland may exacerbate the systemic issue of lack of opteionsfor culturally appropriate food from food banks. Other issues around boundarylevel definitions will likely impact ethnic communities in a broadly similar way tosother communities.aDisabled People14 The Office for Disability Issues has advised that, for disabled people, theefollowing issues require ongoing consideration while Alert Level restrictions arein place:le14.1 If Alert Level 4 is extended in the Auckland region, targeted well-beingout-calling should be considered through service providers, educationRstaff supporting disabled children, and funding of non-governmentorganisations to ensure that at risk family/whanau and individuals haveaccess to food and essential services when these are not able to beaccessed independently.y14.2 improving communications about the flexible COVID testing andlvaccination options available when disabled people have transportedifficulties and/or need adapted approaches. There are reports thatthese accommodations vary between DHBs and that information is notvreadily available.14.3 greater irespect for those who have face covering exemptions (peopletare experiencing aggravation and hostility from security guards, thepubclic, supermarkets etc) and the need to tighten up the exemptionprocess.a14.4 access to key information in alternate formats – NZSL translations, easyo read, blind and low vision formats;14.5 maintaining the provision of home and personal care services, andrensuring support workers service is not compromised by border issues;Pand14.6 for COVID related services, such as vaccinations, gather information indata collection on disabled people accessing these services. Two simplequestions - do you need support today to access this service, are youdisabled?Older People15 Issues that will impact older people during a longer period of time spent athigher Alert Levels include:259xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE15.1 Accessing online services – for older people digital exclusion increaseswith age. Some people still pay bills in person and will be impacted bythe lockdown and not being able to pay their essential service bills(power, telephone etc).15.2 Food delivery services – during lockdown, older people are encouraged dto get others to do their shopping. This becomes problematic if they can’tgo online or aren’t able to get someone to assist them. Sometiemespayment becomes an issue (access to cash). Closure of a number ofsupermarkets in Auckland are also impacting on being able to accesssfood supplies.a16 The difference between Alert Level 3 and 4 settings is not significant for olderpeople. Anxiety about how to keep themselves and others safe will continue toebe high due to the virulent nature of the Delta strain. These increased levels ofanxiety are reportedly putting demands on providers that specialise in providingsupport to older people. Officials predict that demandl for these services/supportewill remain high.17 With the indication that Auckland (at least)R will have lockdown restrictions inplace for at least a month, NGOs and community organisations who have beendelivering services and providing emergency support may experience financialstress. For the rest of the coun try, the impact on organisations will beinfluenced by the length of time spyent at Alert Level 3.18 There is a need to ensure thlat older people who are yet to be vaccinated arebeing proactively contacteed, starting with the oldest cohorts. The longer weremain at AL 3 or 4 the more difficult it becomes for older people to resumenormal activities withv confidence.Young Peopleit19 As reported in the 27 August Alert Level Review Cabinet paper, officials haveseen a sigcnificant surge in support being sought by young people in relation totheir mental and general wellbeing. Temporary funding has been allocated toaYouthline to allow them to cope with the significant increase in demand theyare experiencing for support from young people.o20 Providers are reporting that there are pockets of young people across thecountry struggling. There are a range of issues being reported, includingrneedingsupport to leave unsafe living environments, being isolated and havingPno way to engage support networks, misinformation around vaccine risk leadingto a lack of interest in being vaccinated, and increased anxiety in young people.People experiencing family violence or sexual violence21 Sector bodies (representing providers such as women’s refuges) have notreported any significant shifts in demand for sexual violence and family violenceservices since Alert Level 4 commenced. Police are undertaking furtheranalysis of reports to better understand emerging issues.269xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEAppendix 3 – Overview of previous Cabinet decisions on permissions formovement across the Alert Level 4/3 boundary for work purposesCabinet has agreed to the permissions for movement across the Alert Level 4/3boundary for work purposes1. Cabinet recently agreed that when establishing an Alert Level 4/3 boundary the dsame categories of workers that can travel within the current Alert Level 4 areawill be permitted to move from one Alert Level area to another [CAB XX refeers].2. Travel for work within an Alert Level 4 area and across an Alert Level 4/3sboundary will be restricted to people:a2.1. working for an Alert Level 4 business or service (such as food and beverageproduction); ande2.2. working for a business or service that are exempt from the requirements ofthe Order (such as Police or NZ Fire and Emerglency).e3. This means that workers other than those described in paragraph 2 will not bepermitted to travel to an Alert Level 3 area to work for a business or service thatRcannot operate at Alert Level 4 and vice versa.4. The Director-General [will consider] whether businesses and services whichhave been granted exemptions to operate at Alert Level 4 should also beypermitted to move from one alert level area to another. He can also grantexemptions more generally for travel across an Alert Level boundary.le5. Cabinet also agreed that to minimise the cumulative risk of travel across theboundary employers of workers permitted to travel between Alert Level areasvmust have systems and processes in place to minimise:i5.1. the public health risks of their workers travelling between and within AlerttLevel 3 and 4 areas; andc5.2. the numbers of workers needing to travel between and within Alert Level 3aand4 areas.6. oIn addition to the proposed permissions for workers, Cabinet agreed to arequirement that workers only travel for the permitted purpose and, so far asreasonably practicable, not to stop en-route.rPCabinetalso agreed to several permissions for individual movement across the AlertLevel 4/3 boundary for non-work reasons7. In addition to the proposed permissions for workers, Cabinet agreed that peopleshould only be allowed to travel across the Alert Level boundary (including totransit from one Alert Level 3 area to another) for the following purposes:7.1. urgent care of a child or to provide care or support to a person in a criticalor terminal condition (if no other appropriate person can provide care withinthe area);279xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVE7.2. shared caregiving arrangements;7.3. access a health service with appointment (or receive their Pfizer vaccine inthe same or adjoining district);7.4. access a judicial institution where required or permitted, or to leave or drelocate home on Court order;e7.5. return home from hospital or residential care or health service or relocateto another hospital or residential care or health service;s7.6. emergencies;a7.7. leave New Zealand;e7.8. go home – From Alert Level 3 to Alert Level 4 only;l7.9. go home after MIQ (or arrival in NZ where no MIQ required); ande7.10. care for pets or other animals, if travel is necessary to prevent a breachRof the Animal Welfare Act and no one else in the area can provide the care.8. Where people are travelling in and out of the Alert level 4 area solely for thepurpose of transiting from an Alert Level 3 area to another Alert Level 3 area,ythis is permitted for travel to work (including at an Alert Level 3 business) andtravel home.le9. In addition to these permissions, exemptions for personal travel across the AlertLevel 4/3 boundary can also be granted by the Director-General of Health ofHealth (including forv compassionate reasons).10. As noted abovei for workers, people who are permitted to cross an Alert Levelboundary frotm an Alert Level 4 area to an area at Alert Level 3 would beencouragecd to observe Alert Level 4 restrictions while in the Alert Level 3 area.aorP289xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 07:58:04SENSITIVEAppendix 4 – Key Testing and Contact Tracing Data11.

This paper concerns the Government’s response to COVID-19.oSummaryr3.As at 9am Monday 6 September, there have been 821 confirmed casesP detected since 17 August 2021, of which 804 are in Auckland and 17 inWellington. There were 20 cases in the 24 hours to 9am Monday6 September.4. Case numbers are steadily declining, and as set out in the Director-General ofHealth’s interim health advice, there are increasing reasons to believe that theAuckland outbreak is contained. The Director-General of Health is confidentthat the outbreak is now solely confined to the Auckland region.5. The Director-General of Health’s interim health advice is that Auckland remainat Alert Level 4 for at least another week, and that the rest of the country19xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEmore to Alert Level 2 from 11.59pm Tuesday 7 September. Thisrecommendation is on the basis that restrictions on what will be the 4/2boundary be tightened further from current settings, mandatory surveillancesaliva-testing for workers crossing the boundaries be implemented, and thatchanges be made to strengthen Alert Level 2 settings.d6. I agree that we should keep Auckland at Alert Level 4 for another week, andthat we should move the rest of the country to Alert Level 2 this week. Theequestion is one of timing. My preferred option is that we move all the countryoutside Auckland on Tuesday night. It should be noted that this would notsallow sufficient time for the mandatory surveillance testing regime discussedbelow to be implemented. As such, I propose that the surveillance testingaregime take effect from 11.59pm Thursday 9 September.e7. Moving the South Island to Alert Level 2 on Tuesday night and the rest of theNorth Island on Thursday night would mitigate this risk, but will be complexfrom an operational and communications perspectivle. Moving all the countryeoutside Auckland on Thursday night would be simpler, but risks straining oursocial license in the South Island. I seek Cabinet decisions on these timingoptions. R8. In terms of permitted movement across boundaries, Cabinet has previouslyagreed to permissions for movemen t across the Alert Level 4/3 boundary forwork and non-work purposes. Thye Director-General of Health hasrecommended that the same permissions for businesses and services tomove across Alert Level 4/3l boundaries be applied to any Alert Level 4/2boundary established, bute he recommends narrower non-work purposes (e.g.excluding providing urgent care for a child). On balance I propose that thepreviously agreed pevrmissions for movement across Alert Level 4/3 boundaryfor businesses, services and non-work purposes should apply to the AlertLevel 4/2 bounidary given the low volumes and equity considerations betweenwork and nont-work movement.c9. In line with the Director-General’s advice, I also propose that we establishadditaional surveillance testing across Alert Level boundaries. I propose thatworkers travelling across Alert Level 4 boundaries for permitted reasons berequired to provide evidence of a COVID-19 saliva test within the last 7 days.oThiswould also apply to permitted personal travel, but only where reasonablypracticable. I anticipate that mandatory surveillance testing would be requiredrtocontinue once Auckland moves down to Alert Level 3 (creating a 3/2P boundary), at least for a period of weeks.10. I also agree with the Director-General’s recommendations that we shouldtighten our caps on numbers permitted at indoor social gatherings, eventfacilities and hospitality venues from 100 to 50 and prohibit standing on publictransport. I also propose that we amend physical distancing requirements forcustomers and clients of businesses and services such as gyms, publicfacilities (such as libraries, museums, recreation centres, and swimmingpools), and public-facing social service offices from 1 metre to 2 metres. 1metre distancing requirements would remain in places such as non-public-29xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEfacing offices and factory floors, and in places subject to an explicit cap onnumbers, such as hospitality venues and event facilities.11. I propose that we next consider our Alert Level settings for the whole countryon Monday 13 September.dIntroductione12. This paper is structured in four parts.s12.1. Part 1 includes a situation report on the current COVID-19 outbreak,the Director-General of Health’s recommendations, timing options foraour Alert Level settings in different parts of the country, and anassessment against the health and non-health related factors for AlertLevel decision-making. e12.2.

Part 4 considers remaining matters including financial and legislativeimplications.PART 1: SITUATION REPORT, ALERT LEVELS, AND ASSESSMENT AGAINSTyHEALTH AND NON-HEALTH FACTORSlHow we make Alert Level decisionse13. Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Levvel settings for New Zealand [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer]. This includes the Director-General’s assessment of arange of healthi factors, and evidence of the measures on society, at-riskpopulations, tpublic attitudes, and our ability to operationalise the restrictions.c14. This approach is underpinned by the Elimination Strategy and supports NewZealaand’s vaccine roll-out, which in turn will support the Reconnecting NewZealanders approach to opening our borders when it is safe to do so.oSituation reportr15.Following detection of a case of community transmission of COVID-19 on 17P August, Auckland is currently at Alert Level 4, and the rest of the country iscurrently at Alert Level 3.16. As at 9am Monday 6 September, there have been 821 confirmed casesdetected since 17 August 2021, of which 804 are in Auckland and 17 inWellington. There have been 20 cases in the 24 hours to 9am Monday6 September.17. Case numbers are steadily declining, and as set out in the Director-General ofHealth’s interim health advice, there are increasing reasons to believe that theAuckland outbreak is contained. While there are some causes for concern,39xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEincluding several cases and sub-clusters remaining un-linked, most indicatorsare trending in the right direction.18. The Director-General of Health is confident that the outbreak is now solelyconfined to the Auckland region. The last time a case was infectious in thecommunity in Wellington was on Friday 20 August. dUpdated modelling in relation to the current outbreake19. Te Pūnaha Matatini (TPM) has continued to provide updated modellingsresults from its “branching process” and “contagion network” models. Thisnow includes an estimation of the effective reproduction number (R ) duringeffathe period of Alert Level 4 restrictions.Estimating the effective reproduction number and future case nuembers20. Using case data up to and including Friday 3 September, the modellinglestimates that it is highly likely that the R was significantly below 1 betweeneff eMonday 23 August and Friday 3 September. It is highly likely that the R waseffsignificantly below 1 between 23 August and 3 September: the centralRestimate for R is 0.4 with a 95% confidence interval (0.2, 0.7). The modellingefftherefore projects a continuing reduction in case numbers and eventual returnto elimination under Alert Level 4.y21. Estimates for R can give us confidence that Alert Level 4, contact tracingeffand case management have combined to create a significant reduction inltransmission. However, we must be aware that this is a backwards-lookingemeasure; a cautious approach will account for the risk that R may be highereffthan central estimates or may increase in the future, even without relaxationsvin Alert Levels.i22. As it is uncertain how far R is below 1, and how stable it is over time, it isefftalso uncertain how long transmission is expected to continue. Nevertheless,cmodelling can give a sense of the timeframes associated with a return tolower case numbers and elimination, thereby supporting expectations aroundathe timing of future Alert Level choices.23. oUsing case data up to Friday 3 September, over half of the model simulationsresult in fewer than 10 daily cases beyond Wednesday 15 September.rHowever, the estimated timeframes are very sensitive to emergent case data;the same method has suggested much longer timeframes on earlier casePdata and a few days with higher numbers than the modelling expects willgenerate higher predicted case numbers later into September and beyond.Probability of undetected transmission24. Earlier modelling results estimated the probability of undetected transmissionoutside Auckland, if cases had been seeded early in August. They indicatethat there is a very high likelihood that we would have detected at least someof the resulting cases by now, based on community testing and wastewatersurveillance results. Our greatest risk of community transmission outside49xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEAuckland now relates to those with undetected infection travelling across anAlert Level boundary from Auckland.25. Te Pūnaha Matatini will publish materials on their website this week whichoutline the methods used to model transmission dynamics and estimate Reffduring the outbreak. Discussion with the TPM modelling teams over the next dweek will look more closely at transmission scenarios following a future moveto Alert Level 3 in Auckland. eDirector-General of Health’s assessment against the health factorssSource of the case(s)/outbreaka26. After significant investigation, the most likely source case of this outbreak isthe returnee from New South Wales who arrived at the Crowne Plaza MIQefacility on 7 August. All samples that have been sequenced to date aregenomically linked and are due to the Delta variant.leUpdate on outbreak sub-clusters27. There are currently eight epidemiologically lRinked sub-clusters identified withinthis outbreak, and a further 6 epidemiologically unlinked sub-clusters. TheDirector-General notes that the two largest clusters – the AOG church and theBirkdale Social network – appear to have peaked in terms of new cases.Overall, the proportion of cases thyat were infectious in the community hasstabilised at around 30% and the number of exposure events has decreasedmarkedly since the beginninlg of the Alert Level 4 lockdown. This suggests thelockdown in Auckland is weorking, but we may have some way to go before wecan be confident that the outbreak is under control.vLikelihood that the Auckland outbreak is containedi28. There are several reasons to be increasingly confident that the outbreak intthe Auckland region is contained. In particular:c28.1. The outbreak in Auckland appears to have peaked on Saturday 28aAugust,with daily numbers decreasing steadily since then.o28.2. The proportion of cases infectious in the community has beendecreasing, with 70% of the cases reported on Saturday 4 Septemberr having no exposure events in the community while infectious. Recentlymany of these exposure events have been in supermarkets (withPmasks and physical distancing in place). There have been 10 or fewernew exposure events per day since Tuesday 31 August (compared toa peak of 251 on 17 August).28.3. The proportion of new cases that were known or household contacts ofother cases has increased throughout the outbreak, with 15 (75%) ofthe cases reported on Saturday 4 September contacts of known cases.59xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVE29. Some causes for concern remain, but data points are trending in the rightdirection:29.1. There continue to be cases unlinked epidemiologically, however thisproportion is decreasing daily, with only 3% of cases (27 people) notyet epidemiologically linked or connected to a cluster as at 9am dSunday 5 September.e29.2. Across the country, only 86% of contacts have been reached bycontact tracers, although 99% of close plus contacts have beensreached. 99% of contacts for which location data is held have beenreached.a29.3. There is a cluster of concern – the Mangere Manurewa subcluster. It isnot yet known whether the numbers have peaked ein this cluster. Thissubcluster has also not yet been linked to other clusters.l29.4. Transmission between essential workers ine the Auckland regionremains a risk, including from temporary workers moving betweenfacilities. Since the start of lockdownR there have been 108 exposureevents at workplaces of cases. Of these, 16 exposure events includedworkplaces where there were essential workers. However, there haveonly been a small number of cases identified who were infected withinworkplaces after lockdowny, and no new workplace exposure sitessince Tuesday 31 August.l29.5. Testing rates havee declined significantly since peaking on Tuesday24 August, with some hesitancy emerging. The main drivers for thedecline is that Alert Level 4 settings are suppressing transmission of allvrespiratory symptoms (therefore there are fewer symptomatic people)and fewer locations of interest. Efforts are underway to increaseisurvetillance testing, particularly of health and MIQ workers, andessential workers crossing the boundary. Part 2 of this Cabinet papercoutlines these proposals in more detail.aPotential for undetected community transmission outside of Auckland30. oThe Director-General of Health is confident that the outbreak is now solelyconfined to the Auckland region with recent sporadic cases occurring inrWellington in known household contacts who have been in quarantine duringtheir infectious period. The last time a case was infectious in the community inPWellington was on 20 August. Close to 100% of known contacts outside ofAuckland have been reached and have had at least one test.31. Testing rates outside of Auckland could be better but recent results frommodelling have estimated that with current rates of testing and no furthercases detected, the estimated probability that areas outside Auckland andWellington are COVID-19 free is close to 95%. Although this advice has notincluded Wellington, the Director-General is confident that the modellingestimates can also apply to the Wellington region and that the probability thatit is COVID-19 free is also very high.69xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVE32. There have been no unexpected wastewater detections outside of theAuckland region. Analysis of wastewater samples during this outbreak hasincluded samples from 154 sites, covering and estimated 3.8 million people.There are 103 locations in the North Island, and 51 locations in the SouthIsland.dHealth system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systemse33. As at 9am 5 September 2021, there are 38 current hospitalisations associatedwith the current outbreak. 6 of these are in ICU and 4 are requiring ventilation.s31 of those hospitalised are Pacific peoples. As at 11.59pm on 3 September,there are high levels of ventilator availability across all DHBs and all DHBsaother than Whanganui have available beds in ICU.34. As at 9am Sunday 5 September, there were 38,120 contaects identified inrelation to the August community cases recorded in the National ContactTracing Solution. 32,935 of these have been reacheld. Of the total number ofcontacts, 34,781 are close contacts. These volumees are unprecedented,compared to only approximately 2,600 close contacts identified during theAugust 2020 outbreak over a six-week period.R35. Testing volumes remain elevated but have declined significantly fromprevious highs. In the 7 days to 9am Saturday 4 September, 119,938 testshave been completed (7 day rolling average is 17,134). There were 4,750ytests across the whole country in the 24 hours to 9am Monday 6 September.Even though testing numbers have declined from the highs of the earlyloutbreak they are still relaetively high in the Auckland region (and higher thanthe comparative stage of the August 2020 outbreak).Director-General’s of Healtvh’s conclusions136. Based on the miost recent public health risk assessment completed att10.30am on 5 September, the Director-General’s interim health assessment isas followsc:36.1.a Given the information and test results received to date, continuingcommunity transmission in Auckland cannot yet be ruled out, so theo risk of community transmission remains high to medium.36.2. Given the information and test results received to date, the risk ofrcommunity transmission in the remainder of New Zealand is low.P37.The Director-General’s interim health advice is therefore that:37.1. Auckland remain at Alert Level 4; and37.2. the remainder of New Zealand shift to Alert Level 2 at 11:59pm onTuesday 7 September 2021.1 The Director-General of Health’s conclusion is based on information available as of Sunday, 5September. Where possible, case/contact data in this paper reflects the latest figures as at 9amMonday 6 September.79xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVE38. The Director-General has emphasised that his recommendation for the rest ofNew Zealand to shift to Alert Level 2 is based on parallel advice to Ministerssuggesting:38.1. further restrictions to reduce movement across what will become thenew Alert Level 4/2 boundary (see Part 2 of this paper); d38.2. mandatory surveillance saliva-testing for workers permitted to crosseAlert Level boundaries (see Part 2 of this paper); ands38.3. that changes be made to strengthen Alert Level 2 settings inrecognition of the high transmissibility of the Delta variant (including aanew 50-person gathering limit and a ‘no standing’ requirement forpublic transport) (see Part 3 of this paper).e39. The Director-General’s interim advice is that at least another week is requiredat Alert Level 4 to gather the evidence necessary tol be confident that theoutbreak in Auckland is being successfully contaiened. Before moving to AlertLevel 3 in Auckland, the Director-General considers we would hope to see:R39.1. all known cases have been contacted and are in isolation orquarantine, as deemed necessary by a health professional,39.2. any new emerging cases have been in isolation throughout theiryinfectious period no new unlinked sub-clusters,l39.3. high testing numbers provide reassurance there is no undetectedecommunity transmission in Auckland, andv39.4. no unexpected wastewater results.Options regarding Ailert Levelst40. I agree wicth the Director-General’s interim advice in respect of the Alert Levelsettings in and outside of Auckland. I therefore propose that, as previouslyagreaed, we keep Auckland at Alert Level 4 until at least 11.59pm, Tuesday14 September.o41. The remaining question is a matter of timing for regions outside of Aucklandmoving down Alert Levels. The reason I have presented a range of optionsrregardingthe timing for the shift down from Alert Level 3 outside of AucklandPrelate to the Director-General’s recommendations that any shift to AlertLevel 2 be accompanied by mandatory surveillance saliva-testing for essentialworkers crossing Alert Level boundaries.42. It is worth noting that schools require a minimum of 48 hours’ notice when weshift any region from Alert Level 3 to Alert Level 2. Therefore an earlier shift inalert levels may not fully realise all benefits until schools are re-opened andparents and caregivers currently home schooling are able to return to work.89xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVETiming Option 1: All New Zealand outside of Auckland to move to Alert Level 2 as of11.59pm Tuesday 7 September (Preferred)43. The first – and my preferred – option is for all New Zealand outside ofAuckland to move to Alert Level 2 as of 11.59pm Tuesday 7 September. Atthis stage, agencies involved in standing up the operations of a mandatory dsurveillance testing regime advise that it is very unlikely that such a regimecan be stood up by 11.59pm Tuesday 7 September. Given this, I proposee thatthe mandatory regime would take effect from 11.59pm Thursday9 September. This does create a greater risk of undetected spread of COVID-s19 outside of Auckland, but this is mitigated by the restrictions on movementand increased communication about the importance of general public healthapractices (e.g. staying home when sick).Timing Option 2: South Island move to Alert Level 2 from 11.59pem, Tuesday 7September, North Island outside of Auckland to move to Alert Level 2 from 11.59pmThursday 9 September le44. The second timing option is for the South Island (including Stewart Island andthe Chatham Islands) to move to Alert Level 2 from 11.59pm Tuesday 7RSeptember, and for the North Island outside of Auckland to move to AlertLevel 2 from 11.59pm Thursday 9 September. Advice from operationalagencies is that this would allow tim e for the proposed mandatory testingregime at the land border betweeyn Auckland and the Waikato and Aucklandand Northland to be stood up, consistent with the intent of the Director-General’s advice. However, lthis option would involve a 4/3/2 split for 2 days,which would be complex teo communicate, and involve some operationalcomplexity.vTiming Option 3: Rest of the country outside of Auckland to move to Alert Level 2from 11.59pm Thursday 9 Septemberit45. The third timing option is for the rest of the country outside of Auckland tocmove to Alert Level 2 from 11.59pm Thursday 9 September. As with thesecond option, it would allow time to set up the proposed mandatory testingaregime. It would also avoid the need to have three parts of the country inthree separate Alert Levels at once. However, there is not a strong publicohealth justification for keeping the South Island at Alert Level 2 for twoadditional days which would have attendant economic and social costs.r46.Regardless of which option we select, I propose that we review our settingsPfor the whole of the country on Monday 13 September.Other options considered47. In addition to the two options outlined above, I have considered, butdiscarded, two other options:47.1. Auckland remains at Alert Level 4, the northern part of the Waikatoremains at Alert Level 3, and the remainder of New Zealand moves toAlert Level 2 (not operationally feasible); and99xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVE52. The impacts will differ across industries and within regions. Relative to AlertLevels 3 and 4, Alert Level 2 will enable activity to increase in some industriesmore than others. Industries such as retail and hospitality are expected to seesubstantial increases in activity when moving into Alert Level 2 relative toLevel 3. As shown in the table above, the overall economic impact depends dsignificantly on the extent of the country that is at higher Alert Levels.e53. These estimates are derived from the observed impact previous Alert Levelescalations have had on activity and they do not account for potentialschanges over time (such as firms adapting their behaviour). Previouslockdowns indicate that while activity does fall sharply, a significant amount isadeferred, rather than lost, if the time spent under higher Alert Levelsrestrictions is kept short.e54. The above estimates of GDP impacts do not account for any supply chaindisruptions that may result from the Auckland regionl being in Alert Level 4ewhile other regions are at lower Alert Levels. These impacts have been raisedduring engagements with business. Treasury’s initial assessment suggeststhat Auckland being at Alert Level 4 could inRcrease the impact of COVID-19restrictions in other parts of the country by up to $50m per week given theimportance of Auckland’s manufacturing, warehousing and logistics sectors.These impacts are likely to be uneve n and are relatively small compared tothe overall impacts of COVID-19 yrestrictions.55. Domestic and international elconomic data since the emergence of COVID-19has backed our strategy theat a strong health response has been the besteconomic response, as set out in CAB-21-SUB-0330.vFinancial and in-kind supporti56. The Ministry of Social Development (MSD), in collaboration with other socialtagencies and NEMA, continues to monitor the social impacts of any change incAlert Levels, and any additional support that might be required for people andcommunities.a57. The Wage Subsidy Scheme August 2021 has had strong uptake witho$998.425 million paid as at Thursday 2 September, supporting 889,627 jobs.Applications have been almost entirely from businesses with under 500remployees. There has also been strong take-up of the August 2021Resurgence Support Payment, with 146,732 payments totalling $453 millionPhaving been made to businesses as at Friday 3 September.58. The number of people on a main benefit increased by 7,086 in the two weeksto Friday 27 August and further increases are likely. Food grants alsoincreased significantly compared to the week before lockdown, especially inAuckland, and the increase in grants has been higher than that seen followingthe shift to Alert Level 4 in March 2020.59. Any move down Alert Levels in parts of the country that enable moreeconomic should reduce demand for financial and in-kind support. However,119xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEthe proposals in this paper will result in continued and possibly increaseddemand in Auckland and any other areas that remain at Alert Level 3.Impacts on at-risk populations60. The outbreak of COVID-19 and the associated Alert Level response is havingda range of impacts on at-risk populations. These are set out in more detail inAppendix 2, and include:e60.1. higher vulnerability to COVID-19 amongst Māori and Pacificpopulations (more than 70% of the cases to date Pacific peopsles),exacerbated by lower rates of vaccination amongst these groups;a60.2. restrictions on earning capacity (e.g. loss of jobs, reduced hours, andthe impact of finances of families) which can ampliefy income andpoverty inequities;l60.3. issues with access to support for those still working at Alert Level 4e(including childcare arrangements, and support to adhere with publichealth advice and get vaccinated);R60.4. challenges associated with digital connectedness, and inequitableaccess to testing sites and material essentials such as food, hygieneproducts, and shelter and warmth; andy60.5. ongoing concerns around mental health, with support serviceslexperiencing a significant surge in support being sought byecommunities in relation to their mental and general wellbeing.61. A particular theme inv reporting from agencies across the previous week isincreased needs from vulnerable people relating to food, with high demand forfood banks andi food grants.t62. MSD, NEMcA and social service providers will continue to work withcommunities and provide consistent messaging about the supports already inplacea and how to utilise existing support channels.Public attitudes and complianceo63. Social licence remains crucial to a successful COVID-19 response throughrthe maintenance of public trust. Research undertaken on 28-29 AugustP (focused on Pacific, Māori, Asian and South East Asian Communities)showed broad public support for the current measures. Most New Zealandersremain “happy” to do their part when it comes to the current Alert Levelrestrictions and guidelines, with this emotional acceptance shaped strongly bythe spread of Delta in Australia. A New Zealand Herald-Kantar poll conductedbetween Thursday August 26 and Monday August 30 shows 85% of thosesurveyed continue to support the elimination strategy, at least untilvaccination rates are higher.64. There are some indications of fatigue, with a slight increase in negativesentiment on social media in recent days. There is a strong sense that life will129xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEnot return to normal any time soon and, as more of the population isvaccinated, New Zealanders are increasingly realistic about what a world withthe vaccine looks like. Anecdotal feedback indicates one area of concern isaccess to food and essential items, partially due to financial insecurity, butmore connected to logistical access through the need to self-isolate and somesupermarket closures (particularly in Auckland). d65. Business sentiment analysis has found that, while the themes are similar teothe 2020 Alert Level 4 lockdown period, business sentiment this time is morepositive. The research also found that, with the lengthening of the lockdownsperiod, many small business owners are feeling anxious, as they are havingto factor in the compounding impact of a lack of skilled staff.a66. The prohibition on Auckland businesses supplying non-essential goods toebusinesses outside of Auckland is causing some confusion and creatingsupply constraints in other parts of the country, particularly where Auckland-based businesses are the key or only source of suplply of products. This iselikely to lead to increasing frustration in the coming week.67. By 5pm, Saturday, 4 September, Police hadR received 16,572 online breachnotifications through its 105 system. Overall, Police have conducted 61,853COVID-19 related activities and have issued 3,379 infringements. Issuesidentified in recent Police reporting i nclude:y67.1. small-scale protest activity and online attempts to incite protests;l67.2. disorder, aggressioen, and non-compliance with restrictions atsupermarkets;v67.3. complaints about non-essential Auckland-based businesses trading atAlert Level;it67.4. a spike in reports relating to tradespeople, staff or customers notcwearing masks, associated with the shift to Alert Level 3 south ofAuckland;a67.5. some close contacts of positive COVID-19 becoming increasingly non-o compliant while undergoing their 14-day isolation period in a MIQfacility;r67.6.non-permitted gatherings;P67.7. small numbers of people attempting to cross Alert Level boundarieswhen not permitted; and67.8. lockdown measures exacerbating issues for those experiencing mentalhealth issues and substance abuse.Ability to operationalise the proposals in this paper68. As discussed above, each of the three timing options for a shift to Alert Level2 outside of Auckland presents differing challenges regarding ability to139xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEoperationalise and communicate the proposals. The specific operationalimplications associated with establishing 4/2 boundaries and setting up asurveillance testing regime are discussed in Part 2 of this paper.69. In terms of the options presented above, agencies have highlighted that, ifthere are three Alert Levels operating at once, communications will need to be dvery clear to ensure that people understand what their obligations are. This isespecially important where people are undertaking cross-boundary travel.e70. Similarly, Te Puni Kōkiri emphasises the importance of iwi and hapūsinvolvement in the implementation of boundaries, community response andplanning activities, and collaboration with agencies at the local level.aResponses led by Māori in connection with their communities will lead tostronger wellbeing outcomes for whānau and embedding increasedecommunity resilience. This is being seen in some areas, with iwi standing uponline reo, tikanga, karakia or wellbeing sessions for their members, tosupport their ongoing connections to whānau, whaklapapa and wellbeing.e71. Police has noted that changes to gatherings number limits (and physicaldistancing requirements) are likely to be verRy challenging to enforce, given thepotential number and nature of these gatherings and previous experience,particularly in relation to funerals, tangihanga and church services.Enforcement presence at such gathe rings would also be more challengingfrom a social licence perspective,y than at other gatherings such as sportsevents.lPART 2: BOUNDARY SETTINGeSUpdate on current boundariesv72. On Friday 27 August, Cabinet agreed the permissions for travel across theiboundary between Alert Level 4 and Alert Level 3 areas [CAB-21-MIN-0344trefers]. The following statistics provide an indication of current volumescacross the Auckland boundaries.a73. As at 3.30pm, 4 September, a total of 18,493 vehicles had attempted to travelthrough a checkpoint at the Alert Level 4/3 boundary and were stopped byoPolice.This excludes heavy vehicles passing through the freight prioritylanes. Of these, 675 (or around 3.5%) were turned around, with 607rattempting to travel south and 68 attempting to travel north.P74.As an indicator of volumes including freight passing through checkpoints, onWednesday 1 September, 9,776 vehicles passed through the state highwaycheckpoints between Auckland and the Waikato. Of these, 3,738 were heavyvehicles through the freight priority lanes.75. The shift to Alert Level 3 south of Auckland resulted in a 16% increase inheavy traffic flows across the Auckland boundary on Thursday 2 Septemberrelative to the previous week, while light traffic flows remained low, down by5% compared to the previous week.149xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVE76. On Thursday 2 September, Air New Zealand carried 228 passengers out of,and 241 passengers, into Auckland, which is indicative of daily travellervolumes under current settings.77. As at 9.30am Saturday 4 September, 4,766 companies had been issuedBusiness Travel Documents that can be used as evidence of a worker’s dpermission to cross an Alert Level boundary. These support 31,274 people tocross the Alert Level 4/3 boundary. Transport (10,078 workers) and the eprimary sector (6,897 workers) currently make up the largest shares ofdocuments.s78. Generally, compliance is good. However, issues have been raised of peopleatravelling to the Waikato from Auckland for vaccinations. Travel for medicalreasons is a permitted movement under the Order and therefore these peopleecan cross the boundary. The Waikato DHB is looking into setting upvaccination services at the boundary line to allow travellers from Auckland tobe vaccinated and return to Auckland. leA Cook Strait boundary would be established to support a 4/3/2 splitR79. If we were to move the South Island to Alert Level 2 ahead of the North Island(which is not my preferred option), an additional boundary would need to beestablished at the Cook Strait. Unde r the current Alert Level 4/3 boundarysettings, there are very few peoplye travelling between the North Island andSouth Islands. For example, on Thursday 2 September:l79.1. 276 passengers traevelled from the North Island to the South Island onAir New Zealand flights, s9(2)(b)(ii)vandi79.2. 77 passengers travelled across the Cook Strait on the Interislandertferry.c80. In addition, on Friday 3 September, s9(2)(b)(ii)aIn the week of 23-29 August, 661 people travelled across the CookStrait on the Bluebridge ferry, most of whom were freight drivers.o81. Officials anticipate that the number of people travelling from the North Islandrto the South Island, while the North Island remains at Alert Level 4 or AlertLevel 3, will remain low.P82.Police currently oversee the operation of existing road checkpoints and wouldtake the lead in overseeing the Cook Strait boundary checkpoints, withoperational support from AvSec and MPI officers at relevant airports and ferryterminals. MPI and AvSec officers would check permissions and evidence toensure that those moving across the boundary are permitted to do so. Policewould be available to provide enforcement support, as needed.159xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEPermitted movement across the Cook Strait boundary would be consistent with thecurrent Alert Level 4/3 boundary83. If a 4/3/2 split were to be implemented (which is not my preferred option), thepreviously agreed permissions for movement across Alert Level 4/3boundaries should also apply to the Cook Strait 3/2 boundary for work and dnon-work purposes.e84. Permitted personal movements at the Alert Level 3/2 Cook Strait boundarywould be more restrictive than they were for the previous Alert Level 3/2sboundary when Auckland was in Alert Level 3 in March 2021. However, thecurrent context is different, with Auckland at Alert Level 4 to control anaoutbreak of the Delta variant, and the risk of transmission therefore higher.85. Public health advice is that there continues to be a risk ofe rapid andwidespread transmission of COVID-19 if it reaches an Alert Level 2 area,given there are fewer restrictions on movement andl socialising than thehigher Alert Levels. These relatively low restrictioens rely on effective riskmanagement of the boundary to neighbouring higher Alert Levels where therisk of transmission is higher. RIf an Alert Level 4/2 boundary between Auckland and the rest of the country wererequired, public health advice is that permitted movement would need to betightened furthery86. If an Alert Level 4/2 boundary between Auckland and the rest of the countrylwere required (as it is under my preferred option), public health advice is thatepermitted movement would need to be tightened further. Current permittedmovement at the Alert Level 4/3 boundary between Auckland and the rest ofvthe North Island is based on the public health premise that under both AlertLevels 3 and 4, people should stay home, unless it is essential to doiotherwise. At both Alert Levels there is very limited permitted movement,twhich reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19. As noted above, at AlertcLevel 2, settings are far less restrictive and transmission of the virus couldoccur quicker and with greater reach, and potentially be difficult for contactatracing and other measures to manage.o87. The Director-General of Health advises that businesses and servicespermitted to cross the current Alert Level 4/3 boundary should be permitted torcross a future Alert Level 4/2 boundary. However, he recommends some AlertLevel 4/3 permissions for essential personal movement should be removed toPreduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 from Alert Level 4 to a morepermissive Alert Level 2 area. He proposes that the following categories ofmovement, currently permitted for the Alert Level 4/3 boundary, not bepermitted across an Alert Level 4/2 boundary:87.1. shared bubble arrangements and shared caregiver arrangements;87.2. urgent care of children, or care of person in critical or terminalcondition (when traveling out of the Alert Level 4 area);169xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVE87.3. leaving New Zealand (if that first requires travelling out of the AlertLevel 4 area);87.4. caring for animals; and87.5. accompanying others permitted to cross the boundary where dreasonably necessary (e.g. to access a health service with anappointment).e88. The Ministry of Health advise that these categories present either a mediumsor high risk of transmission, though other than for shared bubble andcaregiving arrangements, they consider the volume of travel is either likely toabe low or is unknown.89. If the changes above were made, movement would only bee permitted acrossAlert Level 4/2 boundaries for the following purposes:l89.1. for businesses and services that are permeitted to operate at AlertLevel 4;R89.2. going home from managed isolation or quarantine, going home to anAlert Level 4 area, or transiting an Alert Level 4 area; and89.3. if required or permitted to attend a court, tribunal, New Zealand ParoleyBoard hearing, or other judicial institution, or to comply with a courtorder, and/or in the case of emergencies, including health andlwellbeing emergencies.e90. For any other situations, case by case exemptions would be needed tovdetermine genuine need for a person to travel out of the Alert Level 4 area.This would be one way of reducing the volume of travel across the boundaryiand thus COVID-19 risk. Changes to boundary permissions will increase thetnumber of travel exemptions received and processed by the Ministry ofcHealth. Clear public communications would reduce the volume of requests fortravel that is permitted by the Order or that are unlikely to meet the thresholdafor an exemption by the Director-General.Howeover, on balance I consider that using the previously agreed Alert Level 4/3permissions for an Alert Level 4/2 boundary would be the most effective approachr91.These additional restrictions could have significant implications for the groupsP outlined in paragraph 87. For example, removing permissions for the urgentcare of children or care of a person in a critical or terminal condition wouldhave social implications for children and whanau. Removing permissions tocare for animals could lead to breaches of the Animal Welfare Act 1999, ifsomeone on the other side of the boundary is unable to care for an animal.Preventing someone from being accompanied may make it impossible forsome people to attend required health appointments if, for example, theycannot drive themselves.92. Any decision to restrict personal movement across the Alert Level 4/3boundary must also be even-handed or proportional. There must be a179xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVErational basis for the decision to retain the existing settings for movementacross the boundary by businesses and services while removing somepermitted personal movement. In addition, the restriction on personalmovement must be proportionate to the risk of COVID-19 spreading from anAlert Level 4 area into an Alert Level 3 area as a result of this personalmovement – the restriction must be no more than is necessary to accomplish dthe prevention of the spread of COVID-19.e93. On balance, if Cabinet agrees to leave Auckland at Alert Level 4 and movethe rest of the country to Alert Level 2 (creating an Alert Level 4/2 boundary), Ispropose that the previously agreed permissions for movement across AlertLevel 4/3 boundary (for both workers and non-workers) should apply to theaAlert Level 4/2 boundary for work and non-work purposes.e94. I consider that this approach is proportionate to the level of risk and minimisesequity issues. This approach will also be clear and easy to understand byboth workers and individuals. leBusiness Travel DocumentsR95. The Business Travel Documents register can be used to support an AlertLevel 4/3/2 split. MBIE have confirmed that the BTD register can now supportmultiple boundaries, and different settings across boundaries, if required.y96. MBIE and sector lead agencies are continuing to improve monitoring ofdocumentation issued through the BTD and can increase monitoring andlauditing of auto-processed categories. Currently monitoring is a sample ofe10%, and has surfaced a 84 erroneous requests (1.6% of total requests). Twocategories have been changed to manual processing, due to very high errorvrates (in the order of 20 requests per category).3i97. Given the level of compliance highlighted in the current monitoring regime,tMBIE proposes that the BTD system continue to auto-process most requestscunder an Alert Level 4/3/2 boundary. If monitoring does indicate increasinglevels of non-compliance, samples could be increased to 20%, and/oracategories with high error rates could be manually reviewed. This would likelymean processing of exemptions would take longer.oImplementing a Cook Strait boundaryr98.Police oversee and enforcement support at additional Cook Strait checkpointsPwill place additional demands on Police resources, which cannot be fullyassessed until sailing and flight schedules are confirmed by the operators.The cross-agency compliance checking role will assist to mitigate theoperational impact on Police. However, the presence of Police officers atCook Strait boundary checkpoints will impact Police’s ongoing ability to3 This includes entities required to provide distance or online learning for primary and secondaryeducation and entities with statutory responsibilities for building and resource consenting that isnecessary to enable the building, construction, and maintenance services189xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVErespond to other demands, including crime and enforcement of other COVID-19 restrictions.99. Supporting the management of the Cook Strait check points would also haveoperational impacts on MPI. Specifically, fisheries patrolling and coastalpresence and compliance would need to be reduced. dAdditional surveillance testing can reduce the risk of the transmission andespread of COVID-19 out of an Alert Level 4 areas100. Under an Alert Level 4/2 boundary split there is an increasing public healthrisk that COVID-19 is seeded from Alert Level 4, where communityatransmission is more likely, to lower Alert Levels where there are fewerrestrictions on personal movement.e101. The Ministry of Health considers that requiring surveillance testing for workerscrossing an Alert Level boundary would provide a hligh level of assurance thatthey are not infected with COVID-19. This includees COVID-19 saliva testingrequirements for:R101.1. workers of Alert Level 4 businesses and services to provide evidenceof a COVID-19 test within the 7 days prior to crossing an Alert Levelboundary; andy101.2. workers doing necessary work at any premises to provide evidence ofa COVID-19 test within the 7 days prior to crossing an Alert Levellboundary.e102. Surveillance testing is not a guarantee that nobody with COVID-19 wouldvcross Alert Level boundary. However, it is an additional layer of protection andis in addition to other fundamental public health measures in place such asiadvice to stay home if sick.tc103. Workers that are employed by a business or service that are exempt from therequirements of the Order – e.g. Police or NZDF personnel – would also beaencouraged to get a COVID-19 test within the 7 days prior to crossing an AlertLevel boundary.o104. The Director-General, in granting any exemptions to individuals to enablerthem to travel across an Alert Level boundary for personal reasons, couldrequire a test as a condition of an exemption.P105.Public health advice is that surveillance testing should apply for either an AlertLevel 4/2 split (including all movement out of Alert Level 4) and also anAlert Level 4/3/2 split (including all movement across an Alert Level 4/3 andAlert Level 3/2 boundaries). However, COVID-19 testing for travel out of anAlert Level 4 area should be prioritised, as this movement carries the greatestpublic health risk.199xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEImplementing mandatory surveillance testing106. I propose that we introduce a mandatory surveillance testing requirement forall business travel into and out of an Alert Level 4 area, from 11:59pmThursday 9 September. Workers in Alert Level 4 businesses or services (andworkers doing necessary work at any premises) could be required to provide devidence of a COVID-19 saliva test within the last 7 days before crossing anAlert Level 4 boundary. People permitted to travel would have to be able teoshow evidence of having had a test when crossing an Alert Level 4/3boundary. They would not have to have a negative result or self-isolate untilsthey receive the result.a107. Similarly, I propose that those travelling into or out of an Alert Level 4 area forpermitted personal reasons would be required – if reasonably practicable – toeprovide evidence of a COVID-19 saliva test within the last 7 days beforecrossing an Alert Level boundary, from 11:59pm Thursday 9 September.l108. I anticipate that mandatory surveillance testing woeuld be required to continueonce Auckland moves down to Alert Level 3 (creating a 3/2 boundary), atleast for a period of weeks. R109. People such as Police, Members of Parliament and prison workers who areexempt from Alert Level Orders but who travel across Alert Level boundaries,would be strongly encouraged to yhave regular tests.There are operational implications for implementing additional surveillance testing forlworkers crossing the boundarye110. Officials consider that surveillance testing could be implemented by 11.59pmvThursday 9 September. However, introducing surveillance testing for workerscrossing an Alert Level boundary will have significant implications forioperational agencies and businesses.tc111. Further work needs to be done to prepare for implementation of additionalsurveillance testing, which includes:a111.1. consulting with agencies, sectors, and workforce unions;o111.2.confirming and establishing sufficient testing capacity to ensuredemand can be met from both existing and new (saliva testing)rproviders;P111.3. working through any required amendments to relevant operationalmechanisms;111.4. developing the necessary communication plan to supportimplementation; and111.5. including a relevant provision to the upcoming Alert Level Orderdrafting to make it a requirement for specified workers crossingbetween Alert Level boundaries show evidence of having had a test209xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVEconcerts. Appendix 1 sets out our previous Alert Level 2 settings in moredetail.116. Although the proposed Alert Level 2 definition will see it used where there is alow risk of transmission of COVID-19, the Director-General of Healthproposes further changes be made to the settings in light of the increased dtransmissibility of the Delta variant. This follows the mandatory face coveringrequirements Cabinet recently agreed to introduce at Alert Level 2, and neewrecord keeping requirements at all Alert Levels. In particular, the Director-General of Health has recommended that:s116.1. there should be a reduction in limits on indoor gatherings from 100 toa50 for any area at Alert Level 2; and116.2. standing on public transport should be prohibited. e117. Currently, what are commonly referred to as gatherilngs, and for which therehas previously been a cap of 100 people per ‘defiened space’, include:117.1. social gatherings (e.g. weddings, funerals, tangihanga, churchRservices, school and inter-club sports);117.2. hospitality venues; andy117.3. event facilities, such as stadiums, cinemas, and casinos.l118. In line with the Director-General’s advice, I propose that we:e118.1. lower caps on the number of people that may be present in an indoordefined spacev at such social gatherings, event facilities and hospitalityvenues from 100 to 50 per defined space. Outdoor caps would remainat 100; aindt118.2. prochibit standing on public transport (excluding school transport).119. In linae with the spirit of the Director-General’s recommendations, I alsopropose that we amend physical distancing requirements for customers andoclients of businesses and services such as gyms, public facilities (such aslibraries, museums, recreation centres, and swimming pools), and public-facing social service offices, from 1 metre to 2 metres. This would align withrexistingphysical distancing requirements for retail stores. 1 metre distancingPrequirements would remain in places such as non-public-facing offices andfactory floors, and in places subject to an explicit cap on numbers, such ashospitality venues and event facilities.120. Officials will update guidance in respect of physical distancing for thesebusinesses, and consider whether we should be more explicit about whatthese physical distancing requirements should mean for capacity in apremises. Officials will also review whether our guidance or settings relatingto multiple adjacent ‘defined spaces’ needs to change, to ensure that thepublic health intent of the changes to caps on numbers is achieved.229xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVE121. Other than these matters, I propose that we generally retain the Alert Level 2settings that were most recently in place in June of 2021, amended to takeinto account subsequent decisions by Cabinet relating to use of facecoverings, record keeping, and removal of the single server rule in hospitality.Implications of the proposed Alert Level 2 changes d122. The proposed changes to Alert Level 2 would, if implemented, haveeimplications for a range of sectors. These are set out in more detail inAppendix 1, but include:s122.1. materially impacting on the revenues of businesses such as cinemas,alarger bars and restaurants, and potentially gyms;122.2. impacting on school and club sports (particularly weith regard tospectators), churches, weddings, funerals and tangihanga;l122.3. limiting capacity on public transport, potenetially affecting people’sability to travel to work or other activities, particularly at peak times;andR122.4. increasing the disparity between businesses and services covered byan explicit cap on numbers, and those that are not subject to an explicitcap (but have requirements around physical distancing), such as retail,yoffices, and factory floors.lFace coverings in schoolse123. I also consider that wearing face coverings in schools should be encouragedin line with our genevral approach to face coverings, i.e. for people over theage of 12 in indoor settings. This would not be mandatory. Practically primaryand intermediaite school students would not be expected to wear facetcoverings.caorP239xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVEthe balance of the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF) is $2.7billion.Resurgence Support Payment August 2021128. Under initial Alert Level scenarios and associated estimated uptake, thedRSPAUG21 was estimated to cost $600 million, though officials recognisedthat a more severe public health situation requiring prolonged periods at AlerteLevels would push costs beyond that figure.129. On Friday 27 August, in response to the public health outlook and imsplicationsof high uptake in the initial days of opening, Cabinet agreed to increase thefunding available under the RSPAUG21 by $300 million [CAB-2a1-MIN-0344refers], raising the total value appropriated to $899.9 million. Cabinet alsoauthorised Joint Ministers to draw down on the CRRF if ceosts escalatebeyond estimates again, up to a cap of $100 million.lLegislative Implications e130. I will make an Order under section 11 of the COVID-19 Public HealthRResponse Act 2020 informed by Cabinet’s decision.131. Before making a replacement Order or amending an Order, I must haveregard to any advice from the Director-General about the risks of the outbreakyor spread of COVID-19, and the nature and extent of any measures that areappropriate to address those risks. I may also have regard to Cabinet’sldecision on the level of public health measures appropriate to respond toethose risks and avoid, mitigate, or remedy the effects of the outbreak orspread of COVID-19.v132. Ministerial consultation requirements will be satisfied through previousiconsultation on template Orders for Alert Level requirements and thetproposals outlined in this paper.c133. It is unlikely that an Order will be able to made until the afternoon of Tuesday7 Seaptember. The Act requires that there be 48 hours between publishing theOrder and its coming into force. However, this requirement does not applyowhere I am satisfied that the Order should come into force urgently to preventor contain the outbreak or spread of COVID-19, or when the effect of therorder is only to remove or reduce requirements imposed by a COVID-19order. For the proposals in this paper, I am satisfied that both circumstancesPwould apply.Impact Analysis134. The Treasury has determined that the regulatory proposals in this paper areexempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Statementbecause they are intended to alleviate the short-term impacts of a declaredemergency event of COVID-19 outbreak.

While our Alert Level 2 settings have evolved over time, the most recent AlertLevel 2 settings agreed to by Cabinet include: d1.1. all businesses able to open and have customers on the premises, witheno caps on numbers in most businesses other than those outlinedbelow, provided that physical distancing rules can be complied with;s1.2. a cap of 100 people per ‘defined space’ in event facilities such asacinemas, theatres, stadiums, concert venues, conference venues, andcasinos;e1.3. on-premises hospitality allowed, subject to requirements for customersto be seated and separated from people at other tables by 1 metre,land with a cap of 100 people in any one ‘deefined space’;1.4. social gatherings, including church services, weddings, funerals andRnon-professional sport, of up to 100 people in any one ‘defined space’;1.5. no physical distancing requirements on public transport or aircraft;y1.6. most recreation and travel allowed;l1.7. all early learning services, schools, kura and tertiary education facilitieseopen for in-person learning; and1.8. physical distavncing, face covering, and record keeping requirements ina range of situations.i2. These settingts were relatively permissive, with the biggest impact of thesettings bceing on ‘super-spreader’-type events such as concerts, and otheractivities where physical distancing cannot be maintained.aThe Director-General of Health considers that tighter Alert Level 2 restrictionsare now requiredo3. As discussed in the body of this paper, the Director-General of Health hasrrecommendedthat there should be a reduction in limits on indoor gatheringsP (including caps on event facilities and hospitality) from 100 to 50 for any areaat Alert Level 2; and prohibitions on standing on public transport. I propose toadopt these options.4. As set out in the body of this paper, I also propose that we amend physicaldistancing requirements for customers and clients of businesses and servicessuch as gyms, public facilities (such as libraries, museums, recreationcentres, and swimming pools), and public-facing social service offices from 1metre to 2 metres. The below table sets out the current and proposed settingsat Alert Level 2 in relation to physical distancing and caps on numbers indifferent settings.319xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVEImplications of the proposed changes5. The Ministry of Health considers that the proposed changes to Alert Level 2settings will materially reduce the extent of transmission if a case of COVID-19 remains in, or enters, an Alert Level 2 region. However, the proposeddsettings will also impact several sectors and activities. It is also important tounderstand what the proposed changes will not achieve. Theseeconsiderations are set out below.Event facilities and hospitality venuess6. The proposed cap of 50 people in indoor event facilities may significantlyaimpact on the revenues of businesses such as cinemas, and larger bars andrestaurants. It is unlikely to substantively impact professional sports events oreconcerts, which were largely unviable even at the old cap of 100.Social gatherings le7. A 50-person limit on social gatherings will impact on a range of settings,including weddings, funerals, tangihanga, church services, and club and inter-Rschool sports8. These restrictions may be accepted by most members of thecommunity for short periods of time. However, if part of the country needs toremain at Alert Level 2 for a period o f months, there may be communitypressure to ease these restrictions.yPublic transport and workplacesle8. The proposal to prohibit standing on public transport (but not school transport)will add to capacity constraints (particularly at peak times) which may limitvpeople’s ability to travel to work or undertake other personal movement.These constraints may be addressed in part by some people travelling toiwork by other modes (including additional car use), or at different times.tHowever, given existing capacity constraints (e.g. driver shortages) in urbanccentres such as Wellington, any additional capacity that may be available isunlikely to meet the demand that will result from this change. As such, thisaproposal may need to be accompanied by guidance that people should workfrom home part of the time (such as at least one day per week) to beoimplementable.r9. In addition to the above, compliance and enforcement will be challenging,particularly for trains where capacity will difficult to monitor because of thePnumber of access points and carriages. Concerns also continue to be raisedby operators about the safety of their staff from non-compliant passengerswho may become abusive if asked not to board a service, and Police havenoted that they would not be able to enforce the restrictions at scale. Theremay also be a reduction in farebox revenue if maximum loadings are reduced,with associated implications for demands on the National Land TransportFund.8 The 50 person cap would not apply to education facilities more generally339xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEGyms, libraries, museums, swimming pools, and social service offices10. Extending physical distancing in these settings from 1 metre to 2 metres mayimpact significantly on the capacity of many of these venues, and in turn, theirrevenues.d11. The extent of the impact will likely depend on normal levels of capacity. Forexample, it may impact significantly on gym classes, but have little impact onelarge venues such as Te Papa.s12. The extent of the impact will also depend on how directly businesses translatephysical distancing requirements into capacity limits for a premises. Officialsaare exploring whether guidance needs to be more prescriptive about whatphysical distancing requirements mean for the number of people allowed tobe in a particular premises at one time. eActivities that will not be impacted by the proposed changesle13. The changes proposed to be adopted at Cabinet today will not affect settingssuch as:R13.1. factory floors or office workplaces; and13.2. shopping malls and individual retail stores.y14. As set out in above, each of these facilities is not currently subject to a cap onattendees, other than ensurilng that physical distancing requirements beingecomplied with (which imposes an effective cap in itself). However, experienceto date suggests that physical distancing restrictions are often not rigorouslyenforced in many ofv these venues. Reducing the cap to 50 will thereforecreate a greater disparity between the activities subject to a cap on numbers,and those that iare not.tEconomic impacct of revised Alert Level 2 settings15. The Treasury has considered proposals to tighten gatherings limits andareduce numbers caps on event facilities and hospitality premises. Theeconomic impact of potential changes to Alert Level 2 settings to tightenogatheringrules and mandate physical distancing on public transport is difficultto quantify. However, the Treasury expects the combined impact of theserchangesto be less than 0.2% of GDP if applied to all of New Zealand outsideP of Auckland. The broad sectors most likely to be impacted by setting thegathering cap at 50 are accommodation and food services, and arts andrecreation. At Alert Level 2, these sectors contribute around 4% of GDP,which limits the aggregate impact to New Zealand’s economy. Other sectorsmight also see a reduction in activity, including community/voluntary sectorevents.16. Treasury’s analysis above did not consider the economic implications ofaddition physical distancing restrictions for gyms and public facilities proposedin this paper. At an aggregate level, the economic impacts of these additionalrestrictions are likely to be relatively small. However, as a number of these349xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEactivities are publicly or community-provided, there could be broader socialimpacts.17. A number of additional factors should also be considered when weighing upthe economic impact of these proposed changes, including seasonal effectson demand for hospitality services, businesses adapting their offerings (e.g. drestaurants moving toward takeaway and outdoor dining), and consumerschanging their behaviour (e.g. additional spending at supermarkets). Theseefactors may further mitigate any aggregate economic impacts.saeleRylevitcaorP359xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVEAPPENDIX 2 – IMPACTS ON AT-RISK POPULATIONSMāori18. At an overall population level, whānau Māori experience the impacts ofongoing lockdowns disproportionately and are more vulnerable to COVID-19dbecause of higher rates of health co-morbidities and other health disparities.Māori also feature disproportionately in mental health statistics, with Te PunieKōkiri regional offices reporting increased mental health concerns andanxiety, increased family violence, and alcohol and drug addiction issuescompared to the lockdowns in 2020. s19. In the Auckland and Northland areas in particular, regional Te Pauni Kokirioffices report increasing stress and anxiety within Māori communities becauseof uncertainty, lack of access and affordability of food and other essentials,ehouseholds struggling to pay bills such as increased heating costs, reducedincome and increasing food prices. Community providers, NGOs, iwi andlhapū report they are running low on operating funding. Although this iseexpected to be covered during the next fortnight through funding announcedthis week, information provided to Te Puni Kokiri regional offices raiseRconcerns that that smaller iwi and hapū may have their needs overlooked infavour of larger iwi and hapū.20. Lockdown extensions will impact on the ability of small Māori businesses toysustain themselves into lower Alert Levels due to low cash reserves and theirability to further adapt to new conditions and restrictions (i.e. digital andlcontactless delivery).e21. In the event of a longer lockdown period, Te Puni Kōkiri supports furthervconsideration of strategies to address access to education through digitaldevices and connectivity for rangatahi and tamariki. This is likely to be aiparticular issue for the Auckland region because of the likelihood of a lengthytperiod before a return to school is possible and where a high proportion ofcschool age Māori reside. Attendance will need to be given to studentsaccessing Alternative Education, where we have received reports of ongoingadifficulties accessing school learning resources.22. oCritical to the COVID-19 elimination strategy will be increasing the vaccinationcoverage across the eligible population, with a particular focus on Māori andrPacifica. While Māori over the age of 60 years are vaccinated at a similarrate to non-Māori, there are significant differences between lower agePpopulation groups – the disparities will be particularly exacerbated by thehigher proportional numbers in Māori age cohorts that have only recentlybecome eligible to access vaccination services. While some progress is beingmade – for example, vaccine booking appointments by Māori in TāmakiMakaurau increased by almost 3,000 last week – vaccination hesitancy andmisinformation may be eroding confidence in government.Pacific peoples23. A significant proportion of the Pacific population living in New Zealand live inthe Auckland region. The current outbreak and associated higher Alert Levels369xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVE(i.e. Alert Level 3 and 4) is impacting the Pacific population in the followingways:23.1. Pacific peoples account for over 70% of the current Covid-19 cases,with the Māngere Assembly of God Church (AOG) of Samoapresenting as the largest sub-cluster of this outbreak. d23.2. Higher Alert Level settings are creating restrictions on earning capacityewhich can amplify income and poverty inequities. Food security andfinancial struggles continue to be key issues. There is ongoingssignificant demand for food parcels and social services, and otheressentials e.g. PPE. Some needs still not being met, e.g. students andachurches without devices.23.3. Nationally, the impact of the lockdown on RSE worekers andoverstayers is a growing concern. Cook Islanders unable to get homedue to closed borders are being supported bly New Zealand-basedcommunity because they are ineligible for esupport.23.4. There has been a significant increasRe in reported mental health issues,particularly among young people, and increased racial discriminationtargeted towards Pacific peoples which is linked to the large outbreakamong the Pacific community in South Auckland.y23.5. Pacific people currently have relatively low vaccination rates andvaccine hesitancy, particularly among young people. This is driven bylmisinformation, reliegious beliefs, and concerns about the recentmyocarditis case.v23.6. There are self-isolation challenges for larger intergenerational families,challenges meeting the criteria to access support (e.g. food parcels,ifinancial support), and issues with vaccination and testing stationstrequiring a booking.c23.7. A need for support for elderly and people living alone (to preventaagainstabuses) has also been identified.Disaboled people24. For disabled people, the following issues require ongoing consideration whilerAlertLevel restrictions are in place:P24.1. If Alert Level 4 is extended in the Auckland region, targeted well-beingout-calling should be considered to ensure that at risk family/whanauand individuals have access to food and essential services when theseare not able to be accessed independently.24.2. Improving communications about the flexible COVID-19 testing andvaccination options available when disabled people have transportdifficulties and/or need adapted approaches.379xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVE24.3. Encouraging greater respect for those who have face coveringexemptions, alongside a tightening up of the exemption process.24.4. Access to key information in alternate formats – New Zealand SignLanguage translations, easy read, blind and low vision formats.d24.5. Maintaining the provision of home and personal care services, andensuring support workers service is not compromised by bordereissues.Ethnic communities s25. Ethnic communities are feeling particularly vulnerable in this locakdown, due tothe combined effects of uncertainty due to broader policy changes inimmigration (the inability to reunite with families and unceertain immigrationstatus for those on work and student visas) and lacking appropriate supportparticularly in mental health and wellbeing. This is despite filling an importantlrole in the country’s response to COVID-19 as esesential workers, and thecontribution to the economy.R26. New Zealand’s ethnic communities make up roughly 20% of the population.About 60% of people from these communities live in Auckland. As withprevious lockdowns, there continue to be concerns around the loss of jobs,reduced hours, and the financial impact on families. Challenges associatedywith digital connectedness and a limited understanding of English can leaveethnic communities, especially the elderly, highly socially vulnerable in thelcontext of COVID-19, particularly if they are not living with whānau as part ofetheir bubble under Alert Level 4. Within ethnic communities, there are manyself-employed or small business owners, which cannot operate under AlertvLevel 4 – a large number of these businesses will be in Auckland. Further,there have been reports that dairy owners have received racist abuse afterienforcing new face covering requirements. There are also reports oftincreasing online racism.c27. The continuation of Alert Level 4 in Auckland may exacerbate the systemicaissue of lack of options for culturally appropriate food from food banks, andthe stress of senior citizens who may have language barriers or anxietyoaroundleaving the house for essential items or vaccination. Moving down toAlert Level 2 in parts of the country will enable further businesses to operaterand will allow small gatherings, which would provide many communities theopportunity to reconnect with their wider communities and support networks.POlderpeople28. Issues that will impact older people during a longer period of time spent athigher Alert Levels include:28.1. Accessing online services – some people still pay bills in person andwill be impacted by the lockdown and not being able to pay theiressential service bills (power, telephone etc).389xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SENSITIVE28.2. Food delivery services – during lockdown, older people areencouraged to get others to do their shopping. This becomesproblematic if they can’t go online or aren’t able to get someone toassist them. Sometimes payment becomes an issue (access to cash).28.3. Anxiety - how older people keep themselves and others safe will dcontinue to be high due to the virulent nature of the Delta strain. Theseincreased levels of anxiety are reportedly putting demands on eproviders that specialise in providing support to older people. Officialspredict that demand for these services/support will remain high.s28.4. Resuming normal activities – the longer we remain at Alert Level 3 or 4athe more difficult it becomes for older people to resume normalactivities with confidence. Moving to Alert Level 2 will be widelyewelcomed by older people. Many will continue to have heightenedlevels of anxiety.lYoung people e29. As reported previously, officials have seen a significant surge in support beingRsought by young people in relation to their mental and general wellbeing.Temporary funding has been allocated to Youthline to allow them to cope withthe significant increase in demand they are experiencing for support fromyoung people.y30. Providers are reporting that there are pockets of young people across thelcountry struggling. There are a range of issues being reported, includingeneeding support to leave unsafe living environments, being isolated andhaving no way to engage support networks, misinformation around vaccinevrisk leading to a lack of interest in being vaccinated, and increased anxiety.People experiencing fiamily violence or sexual violencet31. Sector bocdies have not reported any significant shifts in demand for sexualviolence and family violence services since Alert Level 4 commenced.Preliaminary data from Police shows that there has been a small increase infamily harm reports, noting that they fluctuate due to a range of externalofactors, and it is currently within the normal range. It may be that people arefinding it difficult to reach out for support, and this may result in an increaseddemand for relevant services as areas reach lower Alert Levels. The MinistryrofSocial Development is continuing to keep closely connected to the familyPand sexual violence sector to monitor any increased demand so it canunderstand additional support that may be required.Low income individuals and households32. Income disruption due to Alert Level 3 and 4 may make it harder for somepeople to meet their current and future financial obligations. The impact oncurrent financial obligations has been reported by community food providerswhere the majority of people seeking food parcels are on low incomes (forexample due to reduced wages or the wage subsidy scheme not beingsufficient) as opposed to MSD clients on a main benefit.399xf54yo3ur 2021-09-16 07:33:40SE NS I TIV ECAB-21-MIN-0360(Revised)CabinetMinute of DecisiondThis document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

It would be appreciated ifthe signed version could be returned by 0800 in order to allow time for it to be published andsgazetted in time for its commencement.aOnce signed, could you please return it to the addressees on this email so that the PCO Publicationsteam can arrange for the gazetting and publication.eCould you please also ensure that the below information is provided to the Minister, together withthe order.leHigh Level Summary of the Amendment OrderRAdding some critical building product manufacturers as an Alert Level 4 Business or ServiceThis amendment empowers the CE of MBIE to authorise manufacturers and distributors of certaincritical building products to operate as Alert Level Four Business and Services. It empowers her toyimpose conditions on such an authorisation including in respect of the number of workers that arepermitted to enter the premises of those businesses and services. It further provides that the totallnumber of workers of all businesses and services authorised by the CE under this authorisation toeenter their workplaces must not exceed 100.vYou are able to make a COVID-19 Order that authorises another person (in this case, the CE of MBIE)to authorise otherwise prohibited activities pursuant to s12(1)(d)(ii) of the COVID-19 Public HealthiResponse Act 2020 (the Act)tcThe amendment requires that the CE considers the following when making her decision:(i) the need to maximise the supply of the specified products; anda(ii) the need to minimise movement within the Alert Level 4 area to avoid the risk of thespread of COVID-19;o(iii)the measures the business or service has in place to mitigate the risk of the transmissionrofCOVID-19; andP(iv) the need for each of the specified products be available;The specified products are coated building steel, plaster board and gypsum plaster; and cavityinsulation.This amendment is in line with the decision taken by the COVID-19 Ministerial Group on 7September 2021 [CMG-021-MIN-0018 refers].Procedural Requirements for a COVID-19 Order48 Hour Notification PeriodThe Act requires that a COVID-19 order must be published and gazetted at least 48 hours before itcomes into force. However, this notice period is not required to be observed where the Minister issatisfied that the order should come into force urgently to prevent or contain the outbreak or spreadof COVID-19 or where the effect of the order is only to remove or reduce requirements imposed by aCOVID-19 order. dIn this instance, amendment to the order is a reduction of otherwise applicable requirements. eAccordingly, we consider that the 48-hour notice period need not be observed in this case.sConsultationThe Act requires that before making a COVID-19 order, you consult with the Prime Minister, theaMinister of Justice, and the Minister of Health.eAs this decision was considered by the COVID-19 Ministerial Group, the necessary consultation hasbeen undertaken with the specified Ministers.lPublic Health Advice eThe Act requires that before making a COVID-19 order, you must have had regard to advice from theDirector-General of Health about the risks of the outbreak oRr spread of COVID-19 and the nature andextent of measures (whether voluntary or enforceable) that are appropriate to address those risks.We are advised that the Director-General provided advice directly to the COVID-19 Ministerial Groupon this matter. The Ministry of Health has reviewyed a summary of the proposed amendment andconfirmed that they had no additional public health concerns. However, at the time that theproposal was reviewed, our understandinlg was that the 100-person cap would apply per business. Ithas since been confirmed that the cap eis intended to apply across all businesses in this category. Thefinal proposed amendment restricts personal movement to a greater extent than the alternativeproposal. Accordingly we consider that the proposal is consistent with the Director-General’s advicevon the appropriate Alert Level 4 settings generally.iNew Zealand Bill of Rigthts Act 1990 and other legal considerationsA matter for you to consider each time an order is proposed is whether the exercise of such powerscwill be appropriate. The power to make an order under section 11 of the Act must be exercisedconsistently with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA). Additionally, as you will beacreating a decision-making power, vested in the CE of MBIE, it is important that you are alive to thelegal risks associated with that power and the exercise of it.os9(2)(h)rP"

There wvere 33 new cases in the 24 hours to 9am Monday 13September.i5 The Director-tGeneral of Health’s interim advice notes that evidence suggeststhat the ouctbreak within Auckland is becoming contained to clearly identifiablecommunities, but there remains a risk of undetected cases.a6 Therefore, the Director-General’s interim health advice is that Auckland couldmove to Alert Level 3 from 11:59pm Thursday 16 September with a publicohealthrisk assessment review on Sunday, 26 September. This advicerecommends an additional two days are taken (beyond the previous end daterofTuesday 14 September) to ensure that results from recent testing confirmsP his assessment. He also recommends that the rest of New Zealand remain atAlert Level 2, with a public health review on Sunday 19 September with thepotential to move to Alert Level 1 at a suitable subsequent date.7 Assessment of the proposed options against the non-health factors indicateongoing and increasing challenges related to financial support, economic,social and wellbeing impacts, and changing public attitudes of general fatigue,reinforcing the need to shift Auckland down Alert Levels as soon as it is safeto do so from a public health perspective.1SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VE8 The decision as to when we can safely move Auckland to Alert Level 3 thatwill be made in light of updated information provided orally by the Director-General. I consider our options are to move Auckland to Alert Level 3 at11.59pm Thursday 16 September, or at 11.59pm Tuesday 21 Septembersubject to a final check in with Cabinet on Monday 20 September. Irrespectiveof this decision, the rest of New Zealand should remain at Alert Level 2 until at dleast 11.59pm Tuesday 21 September.e9 A decision today to move to Alert Level 3 either later this week or nextTuesday would allow both further testing and case investigations to confirmsthe Director-General’s assessment that the outbreak in Auckland is in factbecoming contained, and a signal that a move down is in sight. Theaalternative would be to remain at Alert Level 4 and review next Monday.e10 If Auckland moves to Alert Level 3, the Director-General recommends that inaddition to the existing permissions for movement over the current Alert Levelboundary we also allow travel to visit the dying; accolmpany a tūpāpaku oredeceased person to a tangihanga or funeral; and attending a tangihanga orfuneral. I consider that a narrow extension of permitted travel.R11 At a later date, Cabinet will be asked to consider whether, under an ongoingAlert Level 3/2 boundary, further permissions should be allowed to addresspersonal circumstances that are cau sing undue hardship and to enable someworkers in key industries to travely to limit impacts on major infrastructureprojects and supply chains.l12 To mitigate the risk of traveel across the current Alert Level 4/3 and a futureAlert Level 3/2 boundary, I propose all people permitted to travel be requiredto carry evidence of vhaving had a COVID-19 test. However, I do not supportthe Director-General’s recommendation that people making a one-off trip(such as to atteind a tangihanga or funeral) should be required to carryevidence of at negative test. In many cases it will not be practical to procure atest resultc for time critical travel and having different requirements will poseimplementation and communication challenges.aHow we make Alert Level decisionso13 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-rMIN-0387refer]. This includes the Director-General’s assessment of a rangePof health factors; evidence of the measures’ impact on society, at-riskpopulations, and public attitudes; and our ability to operationalise therestrictions.Situation report14 Following detection of a case of community transmission of COVID-19 on17 August, Auckland is currently at Alert Level 4, and the rest of the country iscurrently at Alert Level 2.2SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VE15 As at 9am Monday 13 September, there have been 955 confirmed casesdetected since 17 August 2021, of which 938 are in Auckland and 17 inWellington. There were 33 new cases in the 24 hours to 9am Monday 13September. A number of the new cases are part of known family groups andare not unexpected. More details about the recent positive cases will beprovided verbally by the Director-General of Health at Cabinet today. d16 As set out in the Director-General of Health’s interim health advice, evidenecesuggests that the outbreak within Auckland is becoming contained to clearlyidentifiable communities, but there remains a risk of undetected cases.s17 Although the proportion of cases that were infectious in the community hasabeen decreasing, there have been recent exposure sites at healthcarefacilities, as well as reports of bubble breaches. The recent events of theeunlinked case who presented to Middlemore on Thursday 9 September andthe Manurewa-Mangere Household Cluster represent high risk pockets in thisoutbreak. The unlinked cases from Mt Eden also sulggest potentialeundiagnosed community transmission. The continued identification of cases inunknown contacts suggests that the edge of this cluster is not yet undercontrol, however all other sub-clusters appeRar to be contained.Updated modelling in relation to the current outbreaky18 Te Pūnaha Matatini (TPM) has continued to provide updated modelling resultsfrom its “branching process” and “contagion network” models. This nowlincludes an estimation of the effective reproduction number (R ) during thee effperiod of Alert Level 4 restrictions.vEstimating the effective reproduction number and future case numbersi19 Using case data up to and including Monday 6 September, the centraltestimate for R across the period from 23 August and 6 September was 0.36effc(95% confidence interval (0.17, 0.54)). The modelling therefore projects acontinuing reduction in case numbers and eventual return to elimination ofaCOVID-19 in the community under Alert Level 4.20 oOver the past week, scenarios exploring a relaxation to Alert Level 3 havebeen modelled. These demonstrate that in some circumstances we couldrexpect exponential growth in cases under Alert Level 3, but that this wouldrequire a significant (though not implausible) increase in R (~4x increase)P effcompared with Alert Level 4.21 With the low number of daily new cases, stochastic (random/chance) eventswill now start to dominate in both models and real world. An individual case’scircumstances (size of household, number of other close contacts, whetherany are essential workers, distancing behaviour of those people, etc.) make abig difference to the transmission risks associated with the case. When casenumbers are low, the outlook for the outbreak is increasingly dominated bythese individual case circumstances: the “micro” matters related to each case3SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEare more significant than the “macro” disease transmission parametersincorporated into the models, such as R .eff22 Additionally, in simulating Alert Level 3 scenarios, TPM’s network contagionmodel suggests that a modest increase in connectivity can createdisproportionate relaxation in terms of the overall connectedness of the dpopulation (and therefore the potential for speed and breadth of transmission).Given the additional activity allowed under Alert Level 3, modelling resultsesuggest a significant increase in infections arising from close communitycontacts (as opposed to within households or workplaces).s23 On this basis, officials advise that the modelled scenarios should beaconsidered in conjunction with case-specific information. Under Alert Level 3,the higher R scenarios (and the poorer simulated outcomes within these) areeffemore likely to eventuate where the following conditions are true:23.1 there remain a significant number of undeteclted cases in thecommunity; e23.2 new cases have periods where they Rare likely to be infectious in thecommunity; and23.3 where new cases are infectio us in the community, this occurs in higher-risk settings (i.e. close contacts or numerous, hard to trace, contacts).y24 Modelling results suggest that an earlier move to Alert Level 3 would likelylmake little difference to reported case numbers in the short-run (over the nexte1-2 weeks) compared with scenarios where Alert Level 4 remains in place. Inthe downside scenarios for increased transmission under Alert Level 3, withvR greater than 1, there is a lag before these higher rates of transmissioneffwouldmaterialise in higher daily reported cases. Emergent case-specificiinformation should be used as an early indicator of which scenario is moretlikely.cEstimates oaf symptomatic testing rates25 TPM continue to update their analysis of testing rates in comparison to theoestimatedsymptomatic population. Testing levels are high in the AucklandDHBs and vary elsewhere. Overall, testing rates relative to the symptomaticrpopulationare generally higher than before this outbreak. Maintaining highP testing levels remains important to detecting further clusters early.Director-General of Health’s assessment against the health factorsLikelihood that the Auckland outbreak is contained26 The Director-General is confident that the outbreak continues to be confinedto Auckland. The only recent cases that occurred in Wellington were knownhousehold contacts who were in quarantine during their infectious period. Thelast time a case was infectious in the community in Wellington was on 20August.4SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEUpdate on unlinked cases and sub-clusters of concern27 There continues to be several cases that have not been linked epi-linked.These cases can be separated into two groups:27.1 True unlinked cases – these are linked genomically to the outbreak, butdepi-links have not been found. Work continues to identify epi-links forthese cases. In addition, regarding the Mt Eden cases reported in theelast week, extensive testing has been undertaken in the suburb andgreater Auckland CBD, with no positive results identified.s27.2 Initial unlinked cases who are later found to be contacts associatedwith known sub-clusters. These are of particular concerna and recentlyhave been found in unknown contacts linked to the Mangere-Manurewa sub-cluster and the AOG secondary traensmission sub-cluster. At this point, it is unknown whether the numbers have peakedin these clusters and no clear epi-link has yetl been established. Workis ongoing in establishing the relationship aend building trust with thiscomplex community so that all contacts are identified.R28 The largest sub-clusters are a cluster associated with the AOG Church inMangere (375 confirmed cases), and community transmissions secondary tothe AOG event (158 confirmed cases), and the Birkdale Social Networkcluster associated with Case A (approximately 76 confirmed cases). Allysamples that have been sequenced to date are genomically linked and aredue to the Delta variant.leTesting ratesv29 Overall, testing rates have been very good across the Auckland region,particularly in the populations most impacted by the outbreak. In the rest ofiNew Zealand, testing has been either stable or decreasing.tc30 In the seven days to 1pm Sunday 12 September, 83,186 tests werecompleted. There were 8,657 tests across New Zealand in the 24 hours toa9am Monday 13 September. On Saturday 11 September 2021, 4,928 testswere processed in Auckland, excluding MIF guest and worker testing. Theotruenumber will be 400-500 higher based on registrations still to beprocessed. Tests in Auckland since Monday 6 September have beenraveraging 8,175 per day.P31A testing and surveillance plan is being implemented to maintain high rates oftesting, particularly across Auckland. It includes mini campaigns forasymptomatic testing within the community, as well as targeted essentialbusinesses hosting one-off asymptomatic testing of staff.32 Asymptomatic community testing in the Auckland region has increased,specifically in south and west Auckland, including Mangere, Manurewa, Otara,Papatoetoe, Henderson, and Massey. Since Monday 6 September, 14,000people have been tested. From those tests, 27 cases have been identified. Ofthose, 24 have an identified epi-link to an existing case on investigation with5SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEthree remaining unlinked (but only identified in the past 24 hours). Thistargeted testing will continue over the next few weeks, particularly in affectedcommunities. I have asked officials to explore standing up additional pop-upsites at local community centres (such as supermarkets) to support higherasymptomatic testing.d33 Surveillance testing of health care and emergency workers and workers whocross boundaries has also increased. Since Wednesday 1 September, oveer13,000 such workers have been tested with no positive detections.s34 There remain no unexpected wastewater testing results. Samples from 155sites, covering an estimated 3.8 million people have been analysed. There area103 locations in the North Island and 52 locations in the South Island. As ofSaturday 11 September:e34.1 there are no recent unexpected detections in wastewater collectedoutside the Auckland region; le34.2 there have been three consecutive non-detections in Warkworthfollowing several detections; and R34.3 several sites in Auckland that recently had detections have had severalconsecutive non-detections.yHealth system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systemsl35 As at 9am Sunday 12 Sepetember, there are 18 hospitalisations associatedwith the outbreak. Four of these are in ICU, and of those hospitalised, 14 arePacific peoples. As at 11.59pm Friday 10 September, there are high levels ofvventilator availability across all Auckland DHBs, which also have availablebeds in ICUs.it36 In terms of workforce impacts related to exposure incidents at Aucklandchospitals, the Ministry of Health advise that there have been three main areasaffected by exposure incidents at Counties Manukau District Health Board:a36.1 Out-patient clinic in early period of the current outbreak – 13 staff stoododown.r36.2 The general surgical ward saw 29 staff stood down, but none have todate returned any positive swabs; andP36.3 Maternity ward in recent days, with “minimal” staff stood down.37 Emergency Departments, the COVID wards and ICU have also had directcontact with COVID – however no PPE breaches have occurred, and to date,no staff have tested positive.38 Services have been maintained at Middlemore despite the staff stand-downs.Clinics were greatly reduced as we entered L4 therefore the effects onoutpatient services was minimal (but of course staff could not be re-deployedif they needed to self-isolate). Surgery at Middlemore was already functioning6SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEin pods therefore whilst meaning a re-design of the roster, no clinical issuesarose through the stand-down. Waitemata had to close its ED at North Shorefor some days as around 100 staff were stood down but given this was right atthe start of the current outbreak the “unknowns” were considerable so thereaction of the DHB was prudent.d39 As at 9am Sunday 12 September, there were 38,538 contacts identified inrelation to the August community cases recorded in the National Contact eTracing Solution. 33,541 (87% of total) of these have been reached. Of thetotal number of contacts, 33,711 are close contacts, of which 91% have beensreached. Most importantly, all very close contacts have been tested and,where relevant, remain in isolation.a40 There is a small number of outstanding contacts that the Ministry of Healthehave not been able to reach. In these situations they advise:40.1 Contacts are called and texted daily for 18 dalys. For those for whomthe Ministry of Health have an address, theey ask the local Public HealthUnit to door knock as well. Public health advice is that these cases canbe closed down safely after 18 days Rsince the virus is very unlikely tolast longer than this.Director-General’s of Health’s conclusionsy41 Based on the most recent public health risk assessment completed on12 September, the Director-Gleneral’s interim health assessment is:e41.1 Auckland cases continue to trend downward over time;v41.2 there is no evidence to suggest there is undetected communitytransmisision outside of Auckland, based on ongoing good rates oftestingt;c41.3 evidence suggests the outbreak within the Auckland region isabecoming contained to clearly identifiable communities; and41.4 the COVID-19 risk for Auckland is now considered medium and theorest of New Zealand remains low.r42 Based on this assessment the Director-General’s interim public health adviceP is that:42.1 Auckland move to Alert Level 3 from 11:59pm Thursday 16 Septemberwith a review in just under two weeks on Sunday 26 September;42.2 the rest of New Zealand remain at Alert Level 2 with a review onSunday 19 September with the potential to move to Alert Level 1 at asuitable subsequent date; and7SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VE42.3 Cabinet could agree to move the rest of the country to Alert Level 1,pending no escalation in Auckland’s COVID-19 risk, when it meets onMonday 20 September.43 The following measures will continue in Auckland to ensure that the risk ofundetected transmission in affected communities is mitigated as much as dpossible:e43.1 ongoing significant community engagement with key leaders andagencies to increase access into and support of affected communities;s43.2 a focus on surveillance testing to supplement the ongoing testing toaidentify any potential undetected cases; and43.3 maintaining the high rates of vaccination in Aucklaned, particularly inMāori and Pacific communities in South Auckland.leProposal regarding Alert Levels44 The decision as to when we can safely movRe Auckland to Alert Level 3 thatwill be made in light of updated information provided orally by the Director-General. Pending the most up to date advice on cases reported yesterdayand today, I consider there could be a case for the shift down later than11.59pm Thursday 16 Septembery (as recommended by the Director-General).45 This additional time could alllow for testing results from between now andMonday to give us higher econfidence that there is no undetected transmissionbeyond identifiable communities confirm that the outbreak in Auckland is infact becoming contavined.46 I therefore propose Cabinet decide whether to move Auckland move to AlertiLevel 3 eithetr at:c46.1 11.59pm Thursday 16 September; ora46.2 11.59pm Tuesday 21 September, with a final check in at Cabinet onMonday 20 September.o47 Irrespective of this, the rest of New Zealand should remain at Alert Level 2runtil at least 11.59pm Tuesday 21 September.PAssessmentof the proposed measures/options against the non-health factors48 I have assessed the options against the non-health factors agreed by Cabinet,as set out below. I consider that they support the discussion by Cabinet ofoptions about the timing of any shift down by Auckland. I am particularlyaware of the economic cost of Auckland remaining at Alert Level 4, thepressures on at-risk populations, the risk of diminishing social licence, andincreasing mental health pressures. Those matters reinforce the need to shiftAuckland down as soon as it is safe to do so but, on the other hand, could be8SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12desaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VETreasury estimates the cost to be approximately $10 million per week.Businesses experiencing significant pressures from the additionalrestrictions in Alert Level 2 can apply for the second payment under theResurgence Support Payment (RSP) and potentially subsequentpayments if the Alert Level 2 conditions remain in place for longer.d52 Businesses continue to express concerns regarding supply chain disruptionand labour shortages. These issues are reportedly acute in construction aendrelated sectors. Building materials shortages and price pressures in theindustry are growing more acute owing to strong demand, global shippingsissues, and Auckland’s continued Alert Level 4 restrictions. Supply-sidepressures were prevalent before the current outbreak (due to factors such asaborder settings) and will likely remain even as Alert Level settings arelowered.e53 Previous lockdowns indicate that while activity does fall sharply at higher AlertLevels, a significant amount is deferred rather than llost, if the time spenteunder higher Alert Level restrictions is kept short. Private sector forecastersalso expect resilience. The major banks have reported far less concern fromcustomers than last year, and bank economRists expect that a short, sharpresponse will have a relatively small long-run impact on the economy.Financial and in-kind supporty54 The Ministry of Social Development (MSD), other social agencies and NEMAcontinue to monitor the sociall impacts of any change in Alert Levels, and anyeadditional support that might be required for people and communities.55 The Wage Subsidy Svcheme August 2021 has had strong uptake with$1,689.297 million paid across two payments as at Thursday 9 September,supporting 1,07i8,116 jobs. The vast majority of jobs supported have been forbusinesses wtith under 500 employees. The August 2021 Resurgence SupportPayment Sccheme has had strong uptake as well, with $512.54 million paid to166,220 businesses as of 9 September. The vast majority of support (92% ofrecipaients) has been for businesses with less than 10 employees.56 The number of people on a main benefit increased by 9,450 in the threeoweeksto Friday 3 September and further increases are likely. Food grantsalso increased significantly, up 62% over the three weeks to 3 September,rcomparedto the week before lockdown. The rise in food grants was initiallyP faster than that seen following the shift to Alert Level 4 in March 2020 but hasfallen back in the last week.57 Any move down Alert Levels in parts of the country that enable moreeconomic activity should reduce demand for financial and in-kind support.However, the proposals in this paper will result in continued and possiblyincreased demand from some sectors in Auckland.10SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEImpacts on at-risk populations58 The outbreak of COVID-19 and the associated Alert Level response is havinga range of impacts on at-risk populations. These are set out in more detail inAppendix 1, and include:d58.1 higher vulnerability to, and disproportionate impacts of, COVID-19amongst Māori and Pacific populations, exacerbated by lower rates ofevaccination and existing health co-morbidities amongst these groups;58.2 restrictions on earning capacity (e.g. loss of jobs, reduced housrs, smallbusinesses affected and the impact of finances of families) and issuesaccessing support for those still working at Alert Level 4 a(includingchildcare arrangements, and support to adhere with public healthadvice and get vaccinated); and e58.3 inequitable access to material essentials such as food, hygienelproducts, shelter and warmth, and online fienancial services, and issueswith vaccination and testing stations requiring a booking.R59 Particular themes reported from agencies across the previous week andassociated with the acute impacts of this current outbreak include:59.1 increasing challenges associated with education – digitalyconnectedness and accessing school resources, mixed levels ofengagement with distance learning, and deepening concerns aboutlreturn to school hesitancy and participation levels when they can returneto onsite learning;v59.2 increases in discrimination targeted towards Pacific peoples anddisabled people (related to face-covering exemptions); andit59.3 ongoing demand for mental health support services, with increasedsupcport being sought in relation to people’s mental health and generalwellbeing, and issues related to anxiety.a60 MSD, NEMA and social service providers will continue to work withocommunities and provide consistent messaging about the supports already inplace and how to utilise existing support channels. If Auckland stays at AlertLevel 4, these issues are likely to be exacerbated, whereas a move to AlertrLevel3 might generate some improvements, particularly in relation to mentalPhealth issues.Public attitudes and compliance61 Research undertaken between Tuesday 31 August and Sunday 5 September(focused on Pacific, Māori, Asian and South East Asian communities) showedbroad public support for the current measures and reflected little change fromthe previous week. There is a similar sense of growing adaption amongfamilies to alert level restrictions.11SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VE62 Most New Zealanders remain “happy” to do their part when it comes to thecurrent Alert Level restrictions and guidelines, with this emotional acceptanceshaped strongly by the spread of Delta in Australia. Numbers of peoplescanning in with the COVID-19 Tracer app have seen a significant increasewith 2.6 million scans in the 24 hours to midday Saturday 11 September. Acombination of greater perceived risk (i.e. the current outbreak) combined with dnew mandatory record keeping requirements is likely to be motivatingincreased record keeping behaviours. e63 However, there is a growing sense of fatigue generally, and specifically aboutskeeping up with the ongoing COVID-19 situation and relevant information forthe public, e.g. regarding locations of interest. There has also been growingaconcern about what the future brings economically, socially and health wise.e64 Social listening reports undertaken on Wednesday 8 September show adecrease in neutral sentiment shifting towards negative conversation. Keycategories that show these changes are related to thle Economy and MentaleHealth with 6% and Financial Stability with 7%. Business sentiment analysishas found that with the lengthening of the lockdown period, many smallbusiness owners are feeling anxious, as theRy are having to factor in thecompounding impact of a lack of skilled staff.65 Since the change to Alert Level 3 in areas south of Auckland, infringements,prosecutions, and warnings relateyd to COVID-19 have mostly decreased. InAuckland, infringement rates appear steady under Alert Level 4. At 5pmSaturday 11 September, Pollice had received 7,530 online breach notificationsfor Tāmaki Makaurau throeugh its 105 system. Overall, Police have undertaken22,541 COVID-19 related activities and have issued 1,545 infringements inTāmaki Makaurau. v66 Overall, Police iis seeing very high levels of compliance with the COVID AlertLevel rules. Htowever, recent Police reporting identify some issues including:c66.1 growing protest activity, including plans for a nationwide protest due toatake place during October. Social media scanning demonstratesgrowing interest in the protest and Police will continue to monitor onlineactivity;o66.2continued incidents of aggression and non-compliance with restrictionsr(particularly in relation to the wearing of face coverings) at publicP places like bus interchanges and supermarkets;66.3 small numbers of people attempting to cross Alert Level boundarieswhen not permitted; and66.4 lockdown measures continuing to exacerbate issues for thoseexperiencing mental health challenges, family harm and substanceabuse, with levels of reporting consistent with what Police have seenthroughout the course of this outbreak.12SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VE67 Public attitudes and compliance are reflecting growing trends of anxiety andgeneral fatigue. It is possible these issues will continue to grow the longerAuckland stays at Alert Level 4. A move to Alert Level 3 might improveoutcomes, particularly as to mental health. This reporting serves to reinforcethe need to shift Auckland down Alert Levels as soon as it is safe to do so,from a public health perspective. deAbility to operationalise the proposals in this paper68 I am not proposing any changes to Alert Level settings in this paper. Thesoperational issues therefore relate to implementation of a 3/2 boundary andare set out in the following section.aAlert Level Boundaries eUpdate on current boundaries le69 On Monday 6 September Cabinet agreed that the same categories ofpermitted movement for businesses and services across the previous AlertRLevel 4/3 boundary would also apply to the Alert Level 4/2 boundary [CAB-21-MIN-0360 refers]. In addition, there is a limited number of permissions forindividuals to cross the boundary for non-work purposes, e.g. to provideurgent care for a child or attend a medical appointment.y70 Between 11.59pm Wednesday 1 September and 11.59pm Thursdayl9 September a total of 105,352 vehicles had been stopped at the northerneand southern checkpoints, with 1,402 turned around. Of this number, as at11.59pm, Thursday 9 September,2 554 vehicles had attempted to travelvthrough a checkpoint since the Alert Level 4/2 boundary was established at11.5pm Tuesday 7 September and were stopped by Police.it71 Generally, compliance has been very high and motorists are carrying thecrequired evidence to demonstrate their permitted reason to travel. Onlyaround 1% of vehicles have been turned around.a72 On Friday 10 September, Air New Zealand carried 187 passengers out of,oand 206 passengers into, Auckland. The average daily passenger volumesunder the current Alert level 4/2 settings are 221 arriving and 229 leavingrAuckland.P73As at 12pm Friday 10 September, 6,035 companies had been issuedBusiness Travel Documents that can be used as evidence of a worker’spermission to cross an Alert Level boundary. These support 37,650 people tocross the Alert Level 4/2 boundary. Transport (12,634 workers) and theprimary sector (8,277 workers) currently account for most documents.74 As at 12.30pm Saturday 11 September, the Ministry of Health had received3,154 requests for an exemption to cross the Alert Level 4/2 boundary. Todate, 2,287 requests have been declined and 144 exemptions have been2 Due to the availability of data, checkpoint reporting is next available at 12pm Monday 13 September.13SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEapproved. Other requests are either waiting for approval from the Director-General or are invalid as the reason for travel is permitted under the Order.The public health risk of travel across an Alert Level 3/2 boundary is less than acrossthe Alert Level 4/2 boundaryd75 Under our risk assessments, at Alert Level 3 there is a medium risk ofcommunity transmission. This may mean that there are active, but manageed,clusters. Consequently, Alert Level 3 restrictions are much closer to AlertLevel 4 restrictions than those at Alert Level 2. This reflects the risk tshere maybe undetected chains of transmission or that one or more clusters may breakcontainment. a76 The Director-General of Health’s view is that permitted movement shoulderemain limited at this point as there remains a medium risk of communitytransmission of COVID-19 at Alert Level 3, and an ongoing need to mitigatelthat risk.e77 The Director-General of Health also recommends that surveillance testing ofworkers crossing an Alert Level 3/2 boundaRry continues – this is considered inmore detail below.There are options for permissions across an Alert Level 3/2 boundaryy78 Officials have identified two options for movement across an Alert Level 3/2boundary, which could be phlased in over the course of time that Auckland isein Alert Level 3.79 Initially, under an Alevrt Level 3/2 boundary, officials recommend, in line withthe Director General’s advice, a slight expansion to the Alert Level 4/2permissions in ithe current Order. This expansion would allow additionalpermissions tfor people visiting the dying, attending funerals and tangihanga,and accomcpanying a tūpāpaku or a deceased person.80 This aextension would see the number of individuals crossing the borderremain relatively consistent, and therefore carries the lowest level of publichealth risk. It would be clear, consistent and easy to enforce as those crossingotheboundary would be familiar with existing requirements. Diminishing sociallicence (from both businesses and individuals) due to a longer lockdown mayrmeanthat more attempts to cross the border may be made. However, withP increased spot checks at the boundary to support surveillance testing, it islikely that more people would be turned around before crossing into areaswith lower Alert Levels.81 Expanding permissions to enable people to attend funerals and tangihangarecognises the social and cultural importance of people being able to care fortheir loved ones, and to grieve. We know that people particularly struggle withthe Alert Level restrictions where they are concerned about their whānau andfamily’s wellbeing and when they are in grief. This decision is important tomaintain social licence and to encourage compliance.14SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEAt a later point the 3/2 boundary permissions could be extended82 After some time at Alert Level 3, once the extant risk of transmission is betterunderstood, Cabinet could consider broadening permitted movements. Thiswould see, in addition to the permissions outlined above, permitted travel forbusiness and services and some additional personal movements. d83 Indicatively, officials foresee the below as an option for Cabinet to consider atea later date:sBusinesses and Servicesa83.1 Building, construction, and maintenance services required for keyinfrastructure, including key utilities, infrastructure that enables orsupports supply chains that are needed for other roead and railnetworks, and other infrastructure whose operations, if interrupted,would be seriously impacted. le83.2 Forestry and wood product processing for which the travel betweenalert level areas is reasonably necessary to enable the service to beRprovided and that the provision of the service cannot reasonably bedelayed without substantial implications for the supply chain.Non-work purposesy83.3 Going to the person’s principal home or place of residence (includinglfrom an Alert Level 3 to an Alert Level 2 area).e83.4 Going to, or returning from, the home or place of residence of a sharedvcaregiver (including the shared caregiver or fellow resident required toaccompany the child for this purpose).it83.5 Relocating a home or place of residence, or business premises on acpermanent or long-term basis.84 Analyasis of these broader proposals will be provided to Cabinet on Monday 20September.oSurveillance testing at the Alert Level boundary can be expanded as an additionalrlayer of protectionP85On Monday 6 September Cabinet agreed to introduce a requirement forworkers of Alert Level 4 businesses and services (and any workers doingnecessary work at any premises) to be required to carry evidence of aCOVID-19 test within the last seven days when crossing an Alert Levelboundary [CAB-21-MIN-0360 refers].86 The requirement for workers to carry evidence commences from 11:59pmThursday 16 September. We do not therefore have evidence of the impact ofthis requirement on traffic flows. Police planning for this change is welladvanced. Checking light vehicles will follow current practice with vehicles15SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEbeing asked to show evidence of authorisation to travel and of evidence oftesting within the last seven days.87 Stopping every heavy vehicle to check for evidence would createconsiderable delays and rapidly impact on supply chains. Police thereforeintend to randomly select around 10% of heavy vehicles to be signalled to dcome out of the freight priority lane to be checked for evidence of testing. Thisproportion should be sufficient to deter non-compliance, whilst allowing moestheavy vehicles to pass through without undue delay. I note, however, thatallowing more travel across the boundary and extending testing requirementsswill cause more delays at checkpoints.aThe Director-General of Health recommends all people permitted to cross Alert Levelboundary for personal reasons be required to carry evidence of ae test88 The Director-General of Health recommends that people permitted to crosslAlert Level boundaries for personal reasons be required to carry evidence ofehaving been tested for COVID-19 within the last seven days. However, wherethe travel is of a one-off nature such as attending a tangihanga or funeral, heRproposes they be required to carry evidence of a negative result in theprevious 72 hours, not just evidence of having had a test. He does notrecommend that the requirement should apply if the travel is due to anemergency, urgent care of children and others, or going home after isolationyof quarantine.89 On 6 September Cabinet aglreed that those travelling into or out of an AlerteLevel 4 area for permitted personal reasons should be encouraged to carryevidence of a COVID-19 test within the last seven days before crossing anAlert Level boundaryv. The Director-General’s proposal would impose a legalrequirement that evidence must be carried, rather than being encouraged todo so. it90 Requiring cpeople to carry evidence of having been tested before moving forpersonal reasons will mitigate the risk associated with these movements. Aswith apermitted workers, it will enable the early identification of a COVID-19case in asymptomatic individuals. This may become more frequent as theovaccine roll-out reduces the impact of COVID-19 on some people who arevaccinated, increasing the likelihood of asymptomatic infection. The earlierthat community cases are identified, the greater chance we have of limitingrcommunitytransmission and another outbreak.P91People will be required to carry evidence of having been tested within the pastseven days where the movement is regular, such as taking care of pets orother animals, and the evidential requirement will act as a surveillance testingregime. The Director-General proposes that their regime is like the workerregime, and they are not required to carry evidence of a negative test beforetravelling.92 In other cases, a movement will be a single movement, such as where aperson is accompanying a tūpāpaku or a deceased person to a tangihanga orfuneral. They will likely only need to be tested once and the Director-General16SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEconsidered that they should be required to carry evidence of having returneda negative test within the 72 hours prior to their intended movement. In thesecases, the Director-General considers that a testing requirement is a usefulpublic health tool and will not place an onerous obligation on the individual.93 It is proposed that individuals travelling for emergencies, for urgent care of dchildren and others if no other appropriate person is available, and thosegoing home after isolation or quarantine are exempt from being required toecarry evidence of having undertaken a COVID-19 test within seven days oftravel.s94 Evidence of having undertaken a test would also not be required foraindividuals transiting through Alert Level 3 to journey to or from Northland forpermitted reasons (including by air transit).e95 If Cabinet agrees to implement testing for individuals undertaking permittedmovements, the Ministry of Health consider that thisl requirement can beenabled within 72 hours of announcement. This reequirement could thereforecome into force with the change of Alert Levels at 11:59pm Thursday 16September. RRisks of added complexity96 The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet notes that it is desirable toyhave a consistent requirement for all people crossing boundaries, in order toensure the public receive clear and consistent information, and to allow forlefficient enforcement of thee rules by Police. Having a higher standard ofevidence for certain groups of people risks confusing both people travellingand those enforcing boundaries.v97 Police consider that the changes proposed in this paper will, cumulatively,imake checking at the boundary more difficult, slower and less reliable and willtcreate delays in crossing boundaries. This is due to an increase in the numbercof permitted movements (creating higher traffic flow) and an increase in thecategories of authority to be checked and the variability of types of evidence.aThe latter will increase the time taken to check each vehicle, particularly ifthere are different requirements for different types of personal movements.oDelayscan clearly reduce public satisfaction, trust and confidence, andultimately impact on social licence and the efficiency of essential services andrsupplychains.P98To mitigate these risks, an alternative approach would be to require all peoplecrossing boundaries for personal travel to carry evidence of havingundertaken a COVID-19 test within the seven days prior to travel, but notnecessarily show a negative result.Capacity and capability to deliver additional surveillance testing99 The ability for testing to be undertaken in a timely and efficient manner iscrucial to enabling a surveillance testing regime.17SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12desaeleRylevitcaorPdesaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VEthe table above). The Government also announced that if Alert Level 2settings are still in place in the coming weeks, there will be two further roundsof the RSP, opening on Friday 8 October and Friday 29 October. The cost ofthese rounds will be determined by the Alert Level settings in place at the timeof their respective openings.dLegislative Implicationse112 I will make an Order under section 11 of the COVID-19 Public HealthResponse Act 2020 informed by Cabinet’s decision. s113 Before making a replacement Order or amending an Order, I maust haveregard to any advice from the Director-General about the risks of the outbreakor spread of COVID-19, and the nature and extent of any measures that areeappropriate to address those risks.

However, this requirement does not apply where I amsatisfied that the Order shoulld come into force urgently to prevent or containethe outbreak or spread of COVID-19, or when the effect of the order is only toremove or reduce requirements imposed by a COVID-19 order.

At an overall population level, whānau Māori experience the impacts ofdongoing lockdowns disproportionately and are more vulnerable to COVID-19due to higher rates of health co-morbidities and other health disparities,eincluding mental health. Te Puni Kōkiri regional offices continue to reportincreased mental health concerns and anxiety, increased family violence, andalcohol and drug addiction issues compared to the lockdowns in 202s0.2. The move to Alert Level 2 and the additional funding provided tao Māoriproviders, Whānau Ora Commissioning Agencies, hapū and iwi, is likely toreduce the stress and anxiety within Māori communities caused byeuncertainty, lack of accessibility/affordability of food8 and other essentials,reduced income (including almost 1,500 more Māori receiving JobseekerlWork Ready support in August compared to July) and increasing food prices.eMaintaining access to essential services and other supports for whānau inTāmaki Makaurau, including psychosocial supports and culturally-basedRservices, will remain critical to ensuring the ability for whanau to recoverduring the post lockdown period.3. For example, lack of access to connectivity and digital devices for schoolychildren in Tāmaki Makaurau may become even more severe with ongoingAlert levels 3 and 4. We are aware that some iwi and hapū are working toladdress this issue, which is particularly important because of the higheproportion of school age Māori residing in Tāmaki Makaurau. Attention willneed to be given to students accessing Alternative Education, where we havevreceived reports of ongoing difficulties accessing learning resources. Issuesof return to school and hesitancy because of fear of infection to tamariki anditheir whānau may become an issue.tc4. Continued Alert Level 4 restrictions in Tāmaki Makaurau also adverselyaffects its Māori businesses, including sole traders, diminishing their resiliencyaand recovery capabilities. Muted business signals, lack of interruptioninsurance, supply chain issues and growing inflation are decreasing Māoriobusinesses’ financial reserves and recovery capabilities. Construction workersseeking guaranteed work in nearby Alert Level 2 zones are also predicted toradversely affect Tāmaki Makaurau’s future recovery capabilities.P5.For the rest of Aotearoa under Alert Level 2, some Māori businesses arestruggling to transition to digital channels. Ongoing concerns around viabilityof Māori tourism and hospitality businesses, urge consideration of revised andfocussed supports.6. Despite a considerable increase in total doses administered per 1,000 peoplein the last 2 weeks for all ethnicities, Māori vaccination rates are still trailing8 Numbers of special needs grants for food (numbers of grants not people receiving grants) in August by ethnicity showed71,300 for Māori, 37,800 for NZ European and 13,500 for Pacific peoples.

Food security andfinancial struggles continue to be key issues.

Some needs are still not being met, e.g.students and churches without devices.17.4 Nationally, the impact of the lockdown on RSE workers andoverstayers is a growing concern. Cook Islanders unable to get homedue to closed borders are being supported by New Zealand-based dcommunity because they are ineligible for support.e17.5 There has been in increase in racial discrimination targeted towardsPacific peoples which is linked to the large outbreak among the Pacificscommunity in South Auckland.a17.6 Pacific people currently have relatively low vaccination rates and thereare reports of vaccine hesitancy, particularly among young people. Thisis driven by misinformation, religious beliefs, conceerns about the recentmyocarditis case, and prevalent low health literacy.l17.7 There are self-isolation challenges for largeer intergenerational families,and cultural capability gaps identified in MIQ settings. Other challengesreported include meeting the criteria Rto access support (e.g. foodparcels, financial support), and issues with vaccination and testingstations requiring a booking.17.8 A need for support for elderly and people living alone (to preventyagainst abuses) has also been identified, alongside health andwellbeing impacts and family violence concerns, all of which relate tolconfinement to the ehome bubble under higher alert levels and thestress of reduced or no income.v18 Church leaders, Pacific providers, community navigators, and the Ministry forPacific Peoples continue to be critical sources of trusted information fromigovernment into the community about keeping safe from COVID-19, and thetimportance of getting vaccinated. These trusted sources have also mobilisedcto deliver support for Pacific families and communities alongside pop-updrives to increase both vaccination and COVID-19 testing rates. Someacommunity leaders have also expressed a desire to be supported to beprepared for future lockdowns.oDisabled peoplerP19The current priority issue, while higher Alert Level restrictions are in place, isthe issue of face-covering exemptions. There remains a number ofdocumented incidents of confrontation between disabled people who areunable to use face coverings, and supermarket staff, security guards andsometimes Police. This issue is being responded to through bettercommunications and information with a commitment to monitoring and followup actions. The Ministry of Health is taking the lead alongside the Office forDisability Issues, DPMC, MSD, Police, supermarket chains and disabledpeoples organisations. The key messages being promoted are:28SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VE19.1 For disabled people and the disability community - “the use of facecovering/face masks is an important public health measure to combatCOVID. Some, not all disabled people, and people with mental healthand other health conditions may have difficulty using a face covering.That’s okay! The right to not use a face covering also brings theresponsibility to be especially vigilant on social distancing when in dpublic and/or accessing services.”e19.2 For the wider community - “some disabled people and some peoplewith mental health and/or other health conditions are unable to usesface coverings. That’s okay, respect, don’t judge. Those who areunable to use face coverings should, with care, be able to accessasupermarkets, and other services.”eEthnic communitiesl20 As with previous lockdowns, there continue to be concerns around the loss ofejobs, reduced hours, and the financial impact on families for our ethniccommunities. Challenges associated with digital connectedness and a limitedunderstanding of English can leave ethnic cRommunities, especially the elderly,highly socially vulnerable in the context of COVID-19. Within ethniccommunities, there are many self-employed or small business owners, whichcannot operate under Alert Level 4 – a large number of which are in Auckland.y21 The potential to move to AL3 for Auckland will bring the same benefits tocommunities already in AL3.l While the restrictions at AL3 are relatively similareto AL4, the ability to have contactless pick-up and delivery and expandbubbles will be particularly beneficial to isolated segments of communities.v22 If AL4 in Auckland continues we are likely to see already familiar issuescontinue but toi a lesser extent due to the government and communityresponse ovetr the last few weeks. Examples of issues have been a lack ofoptions focr culturally appropriate food from food banks, and the stress ofsenior citizens who may have language barriers or anxiety around leaving thehousae for essential items or vaccination. Moving down to AL2 in parts of thecountry has already enabled businesses to operate and allowed smallogatherings, which has provided many communities the opportunity toreconnect with their wider communities and support networks.r23The Alert Level changes over the course of the COVID-19 response haveP highlighted persistent systemic vulnerabilities for ethnic communities whichwill need to be addressed in the medium to long term through effort acrossgovernment.Older people24 Issues that will impact older people during a longer period of time spent athigher Alert Levels include:29SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VE24.1 Accessing online services – some people still pay bills in person andwill be impacted by the lockdown and not being able to pay theiressential service bills (power, telephone etc).24.2 Food delivery services – during lockdown, older people areencouraged to get others to do their shopping. This becomes dproblematic if they can’t go online or aren’t able to get someone toassist them. Sometimes payment becomes an issue (access to caseh).24.3 Anxiety – how older people keep themselves and others safe willscontinue generate anxiety due to the virulent nature of the Delta strain.These increased levels of anxiety are reportedly putting demands onaproviders that specialise in providing support to older people. Officialspredict that demand for these services will remain high.e24.4 Resuming normal activities – the longer we remain at Alert Level 3 or 4the more difficult it becomes for older people lto resume normalactivities with confidence. Moving to Alert Leevel 2 will be widelywelcomed by older people, however many will continue to haveheightened levels of anxiety. RYoung people25 As reported previously, officials hyave seen a significant surge in support beingsought by young people in relation to their mental and general wellbeing.Temporary funding has beenl allocated to Youthline to support the significantincrease in demand they aere experiencing. There continues to be anincreasing number of incidents reported by the Youthline Helpline. This weeksaw the highest numvber of incidents reported for the year so far (111 incidentsthis week, which was an increase of 14% from last week). A total of 64incidents this wieek were related to suicide.t26 Providers care reporting that there are pockets of young people across thecountry struggling. There are a range of issues being reported, includingneedaing support to leave unsafe living environments, being isolated andhaving no way to engage support networks, misinformation around vaccinerisk leading to a lack of interest in being vaccinated, increased anxiety, andoyoungpeople with disabilities facing challenges with accessing supports, andCOVID-19 testing and vaccinations.rP27Online learning/education has been a consistent concern for young peopleover the lockdown period. This included issues with access to devices or Wi-Fi connection, inadequate space at home, and young people struggling toengage with online learning. There are some concerns young people may notreturn to school post-lockdown. The extension of the lockdown restrictions isalso creating stress for young people who are looking to transition to tertiaryeducation or secondary school, as they are missing out on open days andface-to-face meetings with universities/colleges.30SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 08:56:12SEN SIT I VEPeople experiencing family violence or sexual violence28 Sector bodies have not reported any significant shifts in demand for sexualviolence and family violence services since Alert Level 4 commenced.Preliminary data from Police shows that there has been a small increase infamily harm reports, noting that they fluctuate due to a range of external dfactors, and it is currently within the normal range. It may be that people arefinding it difficult to reach out for support, and this may result in an increaseeddemand for relevant services as areas reach lower Alert Levels. The Ministryof Social Development is continuing to keep closely connected to the familysand sexual violence sector to monitor any increased demand so it canunderstand additional support that may be required.a29 MSD is re-airing SafeBubble campaign key messages of “It’s OK to ask forehelp” and “Help is still available”, geo-targeted to Auckland.

This paper provides initial advice on the ways that proof of COVID-19 vaccination could Eand should be used domestically by both the government and private sector to reduce theimpact of COVID-19 on public health. We propose that the next stage of further adviceS isdeveloped on this measure for access to high-risk events and venues, particularly overthe upcoming summer season. Subsequent advice would consider possible wider uses ofAvaccination certificates and whether this measure has an ongoing or temporary role toplay in reducing the risk of outbreaks and community spread, both at higher risk eventsand more broadly E2. s9(2)(h) LER3. Given the private sector could implement vaccinYation requirements without governmentintervention, the government has a decision to make on what role it should take on thesemeasures. It could take an active approachL in setting requirements enabling and/orpreventing the use of a CVC in certain settings. Government could also choose to monitorthe private sector’s requirements to pErovide guidance or introduce no requirements.4. We have summarised three high-level options to demonstrate what governmentVrequirements could look like in New Zealand, using international examples to informthese. These are:ITA. Wide application of the vaccination certificate: this could be for customers and/orworkers of bars, restaurants, cafes and other venues/events.CB. Targeted application to high-risk events and venues: this could be for settings thatare determined to be high-risk for transmission, such as large gatherings/events heldAoutdoors and indoors, particularly during the summer season.OC. No government requirements and the private sector determines use in relationto access to their premises: the government could have a role in providingverification and clarity on exempt circumstances (e.g. ensuring access to servicesRsuch as supermarkets and pharmacies).P 5. Officials initially consider that the targeted application of vaccine certificates to high-riskevents and venues (Option B) provides the best balance of risk mitigation, publicacceptability and feasibility to implement as a priority step. This option would bedependent on public health advice, consideration of wider societal factors such asinclusiveness, social licence and equity, and a government decision to take an active rolein setting vaccination status requirements. The initial issues for further consideration onthe government’s role include the purpose of domestic vaccine certificates alongsideother public health measures, equity impacts, the impact on social license and cohesion,INITIAL ADVICE ON THE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES Report No.DPMC: DPMC-2021/22-324 Page 4 of 13IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEand operational factors. Experience with Option B could help to inform any widerapplication, as in Option C.6. Depending on your decision, an update on public health advice can be provided nextweek on whether targeted requirements for high-risk events and venues should beDintroduced, and for what public health objectives, such as helping to reduce virus-spreadand community outbreaks. Subject to your direction, consultation would occur withstakeholders after public health analysis and a decision on what the government’s role Eshould be with CVCs.SBackgroundA7. With the announcement that a digital COVID-19 vaccination certificate to supportinternational travel for New Zealanders (the international certificate) will be available byEDecember 2021, there is growing public and industry interest in the government’s positionon the domestic use of a CVC1. Interest has included whether the government willLintroduce domestic entry requirements to venues, if it will regulate the private sector’s useof entry requirements, the risks of potential discrimination to certain groups, and how tomanage data and privacy concerns. E8. A CVC is a personal health record. It can be used to provRide proof to a third party that aperson has been vaccinated in order to manage and minimise the impact of infectiousdisease outbreaks. Such records can only document that a vaccination event hasoccurred and do not demonstrate immunity. While proof of COVID-19 vaccination isYbecoming an increasingly common measure for international travel, the use of CVCsdomestically is a newer concept and raises different issues for governments to consider.Ls9(2)(h)EVCrown Law Office advice (legally privileged)9. s9(2)(h) ITC10. s9(2)(h)AORP1 There are a number of different terms used internationally and domestically for these, including ‘vaccine passports’ and ‘greenpasses’.

Given that the private sector and other non-government organisations could, with relevantconsiderations, inCtroduce vaccination status as a requirement for entry to their premises, thegovernment should decide what position it will take on CVCs domestically to provide clarityand consistency.

An initial assessment of introducing requirements domestically indicates a risk of beingP inconsistent with the principles of tino rangatiratanga (removing the collective rights of self-determination in different contexts), partnership (top-down requirement) and equity (due tovaccination rates for Māori currently being lower than non-Māori). On active protection, ifCVCs focus on reducing the risk of COVID-19 harm within the community, it could upholdthe principle of active protection of equitable health outcomes for Māori, given on average,2 Headquarters bar owner in Auckland to require vaccine passports, reported in Stuff on 24 August 2021.INITIAL ADVICE ON THE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES Report No.DPMC: DPMC-2021/22-324 Page 6 of 13IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEthe higher risk for Māori of severe health outcomes from COVID-19 and disproportionate lowrates of vaccinations. It should be noted that Māori communities have been very proactive inadopting measures to prevent virus spread during the pandemic.18. Undertaking a more comprehensive analysis of Te Tiriti o Waitangi and consulting with iwiDand Māori on the development and potential use of CVCs would be required on anyintroduction of CVCs as a domestic public health measure.EIn addition to purpose and Te Tiriti o Waitangi considerations, there are several issues thatwill need to be consideredS19. We have identified an initial set of issues that would need to be considered when assessingAthe government’s role and any introduction of CVCs. The government could take an activeapproach in setting requirements enabling/preventing the use of CVCs in certain settings.Government could also choose to monitor private sector’s requirements toE provide guidanceor introduce no requirements. This list is non-exhaustive and includes the:L• Equity impact on different population groups in New Zealand, including exemptionsE• Impact on social licence and cohesion - how would the government’s approachimpact social cohesion, would it be socially acceptable, could it create public concernRand impact the vaccination programme?• Operational considerations, such as data and privacy-protective measures,technology requirements for domestic develoYpment of a CVC, compliance andenforcement measures, the variations in domestic and international vaccines andproof of overseas vaccination. L20. Other relevant legislation, including the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 and HealthElegislation3, has not been assessed for this paper and will be considered in follow upadvice.VThere is a mixed approach and response internationally onIrequirements for proof of vaccination in certain domestic settingsT21. An increasing number of countries have introduced a form of CVC for customers to enterCdomestic venues and events, including concerts, sports events and restaurants. TheCVCs have been introduced for to a variety of purposes, to manage the pandemic byAreducing transmission, provide personal protection against severe disease, reduce theimpact of COVID-19 on the health system and/or to incentivise vaccination. SingaporeandO Norway are examples of countries which focus CVCs on events only (sportingevents and concerts).22R. New South Wales is planning to pilot a vaccine certification domestically in October,integrating a CVC with existing state check-in apps to allow Australians to demonstratetheir vaccination status for participation in hospitality venues and events. The CVCPdemonstrates an individual’s vaccination status at a high level of either fully vaccinated;not fully vaccinated or; exempt from vaccination. Ministers have framed this in thecontext of meeting vaccination targets and unvaccinated people posing a greater public3 Including the Health Act, Health Information Privacy Act, Health Information Privacy Code, Health and Disability Commissioner(Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers’ Rights) Regulations 1996.INITIAL ADVICE ON THE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES Report No.DPMC: DPMC-2021/22-324 Page 7 of 13IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCErisk to themselves and the community4. Vaccination certification domestically could helpto incentivise vaccination in New Zealand also.23. As disease rates have fallen in some countries, CVC requirements have been removed.It was announced this week that England will not introduce CVCs for access intoDnightclubs and large events. This is reported as due to a high vaccine uptake, regulartesting and availability of new treatments for COVID-19. In this circumstance, diseaseprevalence and high level of immunity is relevant, which is derived from the high rate of Einfection and natural immunity. The modelling would be different for New Zealand, giventhe extremely low levels of infection in the population. Denmark has also removed theSrequirement to have a CVC to visit restaurants, sports centres and hairdressers due toits high vaccination rate. From these examples, New Zealand may opt to considerAvaccination certificates as a temporary requirement for entry to high-risk events orvenues, to be reviewed as vaccination targets are met.E24. There are also examples of governments introducing vaccination status as arequirement to enter workplaces. France’s CVC is required for custLomers to entercultural and leisure venues, as well as requiring it for employees in contact with thepublic. This has resulted in large protests, however it has signEificantly increasedvaccination rates. The US has recently announced it will mandate COVID-19 vaccinesfor federal employees in companies with more than 100 staff and federal staff, whichRcovers around 100 million workers.25.

With the vaccination uptake varying across groups and some groups not being eligible(e.g. children under 12 and those for health reasons) for the vaccine, any access basedon vaccination status could result in social, economic and cultural inequities for affectedDgroups. This includes for young people who are the last eligible group to receive thevaccine and marginalised groups that are traditionally harder to reach (e.g. homelesspeople and those less likely to have identification material), who are all eligible to be Evaccinated in New Zealand. There will also need to be consideration for New Zealandersvaccinated outside of New Zealand. S30. Vaccination rates for Māori and Pacific peoples are not on par with non-Māori and non-APacific. There has been an increase in vaccine uptake by Pacific communities since thecurrent outbreak and significant work is required to ensure this increase is sustained.For Māori, especially young people, this group is receiving a lower proporEtion of dosesthan would be expected if equity were being achieved. There should also be aconsideration for people with a disability, who may be unable to recLeive the vaccine forhealth reasons.E31. Dependent on the settings captured by any requirements, the introduction of CVCs willhave an impact on social cohesion that will need mitigation. This includes if churches,Rmarae and other religious/cultural settings are required to use CVCs and the impact thiscould have on communities. There is also a risk that restrictions on where unvaccinatedpeople may go could negatively impact the trust th at has been built around the COVID-19 vaccination rollout and to address vaccine hYesitancy that is linked to a wider mistrustof the health system5. Targeted funding, programmes, communication and educationcould be important in mitigating this risk. L32. A multi-platform approach (i.e. a digEital and paper option) for international travel iscurrently being developed to protect against digital discrimination for individuals whohave reduced access to technology. A similar approach would be needed for anyVintroduction of a digital CVC. This is relevant for older people and disabled people.IThere are issues relating to employees of venues/events captured that willTneed to be considered in a decision on whether the government should introduce CVCsC33. When considering the use of CVCs, in addition to the issues mentioned above, it wouldbe relevant to consider how this links with any requirements, government or employerprovided, Afor work to be completed by a vaccinated worker (e.g. workers at high-riskevents and venues). The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) hasprovided advice to Minister Wood on vaccination requirements in workplaces. Currently,Oan employer or Person Conducting a Business or Undertaking (PCBU) may determinethat vaccination is required for certain work for health and safety reasons (justified by aCOVID-19 exposure risk assessment), or because work is covered by the COVID-19RPublic Health Response (Vaccinations) Order 2021.P34. MBIE also advised that subject to several considerations, including public health, the riskof outbreak/spread of COVID-19 and human rights, the Government may introducelegislation to change what work requires vaccination (e.g. to reduce reliance on5 s9(2)(g)(i)INITIAL ADVICE ON THE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES Report No.DPMC: DPMC-2021/22-324 Page 9 of 13IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEcompanies’ risk assessments) or standardise infection prevention and control measuresin the absence of vaccination for higher-risk work (e.g. regular testing).35. We understand that the high-level options we have suggested in Table 1 are consistentwith MBIE’s advice. All options would involve exemptions for those who cannot beDvaccinated and their introduction would be dependent on a public health imperative.Initial assessment of high-level options E36. We have summarised three high-level options to demonstrate what government Srequirements could look like in New Zealand, using international examples to informthese. These are subject to public health analysis and a decision on what the Agovernment’s role will be on CVCs.ETable 1: High Level Options – Preliminary AssessmentLHigh Level Options Where would it apply?

Officials propose to engage with Treaty partners, Pasifika representatives andrepresentatives of people with disabilities via the DPMC Community Panel and businessIstakeholders via the Business Leaders Forum to test the appetite, concerns and optionsTfor the introduction of CVCs. It would also be important to engage with the hospitalityand arts sectors.C39. We could test out the scenario of targeting requirements for high-risk events and venuesand considAer additional options as part of this engagement.Financial ImplicationsO40.

Adjusted Alert Level 2 and 3 settingsRare also proposed.Relation to government prioritiesy3 This paper concerns the Government’s response to COVID-19.lSummary e4 As at 9am Monday 20 September, there have been 1,071 confirmed casesvdetected since 17 August 2021, of which 1,054 are in Auckland and 17 inWellington. There were 22 new cases in the 24 hours to 9am Monday 20iSeptember, atll of which are in Auckland and Waikato.c5 As at 5pm 19 September, the Director-General is confident that the outbreakin the Auckland region is contained. The outbreak appears to have peaked onaSaturday 28 August, with daily numbers generally decreasing or remainingstatic at low levels as the expected tail of the outbreak manifests. There hasobeenno indication of any widespread community transmission outsideAuckland and Wellington. However, I am concerned about the cases reportedrlastnight in the northern Waikato.P6On this basis, the Director-General’s interim public health advice is thatAuckland can move down to Alert Level 3 from 11.59pm Tuesday 21September. He also recommends that the remainder of the country shouldmove down from elevated Alert Level 2 settings to normal Alert Level 2settings (with some minor changes, as outlined in Appendix 2) from 11.59pmTuesday 21 September. The Director-General recommends that these AlertLevel settings remain in place for two weeks, and a strong focus onvaccination and enhanced testing continues across the country.1SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VE7 Assessment of the proposed Alert Level options against non-health factorsindicates ongoing and increasing challenges related to financial support,economic, social and wellbeing impacts. Public attitudes of general fatigue areintensifying and willingness to comply with some public health measures isreportedly reducing. A reduction in Auckland’s Alert Level restrictions to AlertLevel 3 is likely to alleviate some of these concerns. d8 Last Monday, Cabinet agreed in principle to move Auckland to Alert level 3efrom 11.59pm Tuesday 21 September, subject to further public health adviceand review at Cabinet today. On the basis of the Director-General’s advice, Isam confident that we can safely move Auckland to Alert Level 3 as planned.While Auckland remains at a higher Alert Level, with active clusters of COVID-a19 in the community, I do not suggest moving any other part of the country toAlert Level 1 at this time. Keeping the rest of New Zealand at Alert Level 2 iseconsistent with the risk assessments that underpin our Alert Level frameworkand reducing the risk of community transmission outside of Auckland. I agreelwith the Director-General’s proposal that the levels are next reviewed in twoeweeks. However, in light of the cases in the northern Waikato reported lastnight, further advice will be provided today on moving the affected communityto a higher Alert Level by extending the AucRkland Alert Level or use of asection 70 notice.9 I propose to consider implementing any changes to Alert Level 2 over time.Initially, I propose to increase the yindoor gathering or capacity limits andremove the no standing rule on public transport. I am seeking Cabinet’s viewson progressing two of the Dilrector-General's other proposed changes today,erelated to physical distancing and face coverings.10 The remainder of thev Director-General’s recommended adjustments to theAlert Level 2 settings (see Appendix 2) are more complex and require moredetailed considieration. I am therefore proposing officials undertake furtherwork on theste and report back to Ministers with Power to Act on options toprogress tchem in the week of 27 September.11 We pareviously agreed that permissions for moving across an Alert Level 3/2boundary remain consistent with the permitted movements under an AlertLevel 4/2 boundary. I propose revoking the additional permissions for travel toovisitthe dying, accompany a tūpāpaku or attend a funeral or tangihanga thatCabinet agreed to on 13 September. Permission to travel in these situationsrwillinstead be dealt with by exemption requests to the Director-General.P12The paper also details the testing framework for personal movements and theuse of saliva testing as part of testing requirements. It confirms that peoplemoving across an Alert Level 3/2 boundary for permitted personal reasons willneed a test. Where the travel may be regular people will be required to carryevidence of having been tested in the last seven days prior to travel. Wheretravel is more likely to be one-off, a negative COVID-19 test, returned in the72 hours prior to travel, will be required . The Director-General of Health willalso require a negative pre-departure test as a condition of any personalexemptions granted for one-off travel, e.g. travelling to attend the funeral of aclose relative.2SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEPART 1: SITUATION REPORT, ALERT LEVELS, AND ASSESSMENT AGAINSTHEALTH AND NON-HEALTH FACTORSHow we make Alert Level decisionsd13 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer].

There were 22 new cases in the 24 hours to 9am Monday20 September, all of which are in Auckland and northern Waikato.y16 As set out in the Director-General of Health’s interim health advice, theongoing decline in cases, lack of unexpected wastewater testing results, andlreduced proportion of cases infectious in the community suggest that theecurrent outbreak in Auckland is gradually coming under control. There is nowidespread COVID-19 transmission outside of Auckland and close to 100vpercent of known contacts have been reached and had at least one test.i17 Targeted testing and communications around testing if symptomatic continue,tto gain reassurance that all chains of transmission have been identified andcinterrupted. Daily tests are tracking considerably higher than the 7,000 testsper day target in place earlier in the outbreak. The testing strategy remainsaflexible, focused on a mix of surveillance and targeted testing at areas ofconcern. In addition to usual testing, over the coming weeks a pilot of rapidoantigen testing will commence at Middlemore Hospital ED, further testing willbe considered in high-risk locations where people intermingle, and a morergranular level of testing will be undertaken around specific cases and high-risklocations.PUpdatedmodelling in relation to the current outbreak18 Te Pūnaha Matatini (TPM) has continued to provide updated modelling resultsfrom its “branching process” and “contagion network” models in relation to thecurrent outbreak.Simulating a move to Alert Level 33SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46desaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VEinformation should be used as an early indicator of whether downsidescenarios are becoming more likely.25 As with the previous Alert Level review Cabinet paper, officials continue toadvise that the modelled scenarios should be considered in conjunction withcase-specific information. Case-specific factors should inform Cabinet’s dconsideration of whether “very optimistic”, “optimistic” or “pessimistic”simulations are more likely in the current circumstances. Under Alert Leveel 3,the higher R scenarios (and the poorer simulated outcomes within these)effare more likely to eventuate where:s25.1 there remain a significant number of undetected cases in theacommunity;25.2 new cases have periods where they are likely to bee infectious in thecommunity; andl25.3 new cases are infectious in the communitye – more likely in higher-risksettings where there are numerous, hard to trace, contacts.RDirector-General of Health’s assessment against the health factorsLikelihood that the Auckland outbreak is containedy26 The Director-General’s interim assessment is that he is increasingly confidentthat the outbreak in Aucklanld is being contained. At the time of theeassessment, all recent cases had been reported in the Auckland region, withone recent case (reported on Saturday 18 September) suspected to havebeen infectious in thve community in Waikato since Saturday 11 September.Three household contacts have subsequently tested positive near Mangatangischool in the noirthern Waikato (an Alert Level 2 area). Swabbing has beentset up at the local marae, the school has been closed and is being deepcleaned, acnd pupils and families have been notified to get a test and isolateuntil they get a negative result. All students at the school are being treated asclosea contacts at this time. The Director-General expects to see more positivecases related to this family.o27 Another case (truck driver) visited Mt Maunganui and Cambridge. The eventsoutside of Auckland were considered to be low risk at the time of the interimradvice.The last time a case was infectious in the community in WellingtonPwas on Friday 20 August.28 The outbreak in Auckland appears to have peaked on Saturday 28 August.The number of new daily cases reported in the Auckland region have beendecreasing but have plateaued at around 10 to 20 cases in recent days. Anupdate on any recent positive cases of interest will be provided verbally by theDirector-General of Health at Cabinet today.5SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEUpdate on unlinked cases and sub-clusters of concern29 According to Ministry of Health risk assessment data, there are currently 32cases that have not been epidemiologically linked to the initial cluster. Onlyseven cases are unlinked within the last 14 days with investigations for a linkongoing. d30 There are currently 9 epidemiologically linked subclusters within this outbreakeand 10 epidemiologically unlinked subclusters (as defined by ARPHS). Mostsubclusters are now dormant (no new cases for over a week) or controlleds(any new cases are known household contacts in isolation). There are twoclusters of particular concern that are being closely monitored due to welfareaand social compliance issues. These are the Māngere-Manurewa households(73 confirmed cases) and the South Auckland Households 2 (24 cases). Thecontinued identification of cases in unknown contacts in theese sub-clusterssuggests that their edges may not yet be contained.l31 All other sub-clusters appear to be contained. s9(2e)(b)(ii)RTesting rates32 Overall, testing rates have been very good across the Auckland region. Theymajority of known contacts have been reached and over 98 percent of thesecontacts have had at least one test. Close to 100 percent of known contactsloutside of Auckland have ebeen reached and have had at least one test.33 In the last seven days to Sunday 19 September, 92,264 tests werevcompleted. There were 8,084 tests across New Zealand in the 24 hours to9am Monday 20 September. Approximately 3.2 million tests have beenicompleted since the country shifted to Alert Level 4 in August, with a seven-tday rolling average of 13,177 tests.c34 Targeted asymptomatic testing is also currently underway in the Aucklandaregion focussing on DHB staff, health care workers and other Alert Level 4workers. This targeted asymptomatic testing will continue over the next fewoweeks,particularly in affected communities. Testing in affected suburbs hasbeen especially high with ten percent of the population being tested in the lastrtwo weeks. People with cold or flu symptoms in high-risk suburbs are beingP asked to get a COVID-19 test regardless of how mild their symptoms are.35 Since 1 September, 25,429 Alert Level 4 workers have been tested. This hasincluded 8,475 DHB workers, 5,280 other healthcare workers and 11,674other Alert Level 4 workers.36 There have been no unexpected wastewater detections outside of theAuckland region since last Monday 13 September.6SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEHealth system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systems37 As at 9am Sunday 19 September, there were 13 current hospitalisationsassociated with the current outbreak (10 are active cases and three arerecovered cases). Of these 13 cases, seven are in Middlemore (includingthree ICU patients), one is in North Shore Hospital and five are in Auckland dCity Hospital (including once ICU patient). Three patients require ventilation.e38 There are no issues with the supply of laboratory testing equipment andpersonal protective equipment despite the surge in demand during thissoutbreak.39 As at 9am Saturday 18 September, there were 39,341 contactsa identified inrelation to the Auckland community cases recorded in the National ContactTracing Solution. Of these 39,341 contacts, 1,282 are Cloese Plus contacts (98percent have been contacted and advised to isolate and be tested), 34,309are Close contacts (90 percent have been reached land advised to isolate andbe tested) and 3,750 are Casual Plus contacts (49e percent have beencontacted and advised to isolate and be tested).R40 Over the last two weeks, case and contact management has become morecomplex. This is based on the communities that have been affected and theassociated level of support that is required to ensure the necessaryengagement with the public health advice.y41 In response, public health units from outside Auckland have supported overalllcontact tracing service by leading specific tasks (including source and caseeinvestigations). The National Investigation and Tracing Centre (NITC) hasactivated surge capacity from two primary call centres and there is sufficientvcapacity to manage a large increase of contacts if required.i42 Although there has been good progress over the past week to share worktacross the country and to identify additional staff for Auckland, the workforcecis stretched and fatigued. Further recruitment is underway to find criticalresources and ARPHS has developed resourcing plans for the next twoamonths.oDirector-General’s of Health’s conclusionsr43Based on the most recent public health risk assessment completed onP 19 September, the Director-General’s interim health assessment is:43.1 Auckland cases have been decreasing or remaining static at low levelsas the expected tail of the outbreak manifests.43.2 There is no widespread COVID-19 transmission outside of Aucklandand close to 100 percent of known contacts have been reached andhad at least one test.43.3 The risk of community transmission in Auckland is medium, with therisk being low for the rest of New Zealand.7SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46desaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VEAlert Levels, while Auckland remains at Alert Level 4.2 At Alert Level 3,schools and early learning services are open for children and young peopleup to year 10 whose parents and caregivers have to leave home to work andthere is no one at home to look after them. At Alert Level 3 children and youngpeople remain in bubbles of 10 at school and early learning service. There isonly limited capacity for onsite learning at Level 3. Schools and early learning dcentres may need up to 48 hours following an announcement to mover toAlert Level 3 to prepare to reopen. e50 To provide additional reassurance about Auckland moving to Alert Level 3, Issuggest the following recommendations made by the Director-General arealso carried out in the Auckland region:a50.1 Continued relationship building with affected high-risk community;e50.2 Continued enhanced testing to identify cases in unknown contacts,including exploring surveillance testing of buslinesses operating at Alertlevel 3; and e50.3 Ongoing drive to rapidly increase vacRcination rates across Auckland.Assessment of the proposed measures/options against the non-health factors51 I have assessed the options againyst the non-health factors agreed by Cabinet,as set out below. While I remain aware of the economic impact of Alert Level4 restrictions on Auckland, I lam reassured by traffic and electronic cardspending recovery in areaes outside of Auckland since the shift to lower AlertLevels. Pressure on at-risk populations, mental health impacts, and demandfor essential supportv (including food parcels) continue as Alert Levelrestrictions endure, especially in Auckland. Moving Auckland to Alert Level 3is likely to alleviiate many of these issues. Compliance with Alert Levelrestrictions atnd other public health measures should continue to beencouragecd, particularly as willingness to comply is reportedly reducing forsome measures and general fatigue from Alert Level restrictions intensifies.aEconomic impacts from Alert Levelso52 There is considerable uncertainty about the size of the impact of the AlertLevel restrictions. Treasury undertook a full re-calibration of the impacts of therAlertLevel restrictions in the BEFU forecasts in April 2021. These estimatesPhave subsequently been updated to reflect changes to tighten Alert Level 2settings as well as the spill-over effects from Auckland being at Alert Level 4while the rest of the country is at lower Alert Levels.Table 2: Approximate economic impacts of the Alert Level restrictions relative to AlertLevel 1 (rounded to nearest $10m)32 Clause 25(2)(a)(ii) of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 11) 2021refers.3 These projections are based on “Delta Alert Level 2” settings, including a cap of 50 people for indoor hospitality venues.9SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46desaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VElikely diminish over time as people become more accustomed to wearing facecoverings as part of everyday life.59 The Ministry of Social Development (MSD), other social agencies, and NEMAcontinue to monitor the social impacts of any change in Alert Levels, and anyadditional support that might be required for people and communities. d60 The Wage Subsidy Scheme August 2021 has had strong uptake with $2,098emillion paid across two payments as at Thursday 16 September, supporting1,198,084 jobs. The vast majority of jobs supported have been for businessesswith under 500 employees. The August 2021 Resurgence Support PaymentScheme has had strong uptake as well with $572 million paid to 185,000abusinesses as of Friday 17 September. The vast majority of support (93percent of recipients) has been for businesses with fewer than 10 employees.e61 The number of people on a main benefit increased by 10,272 in the fourweeks to Friday 10 September and while further inclreases are likely, the rateof growth has slowed considerably. Food grants inecreased significantly in thefirst two weeks after lockdown, peaking 81 percent higher than beforelockdown for the week of 27 August. They hRave since fallen, but remain 20percent higher than pre-lockdown for the week of 10 September. TheAuckland region is now receiving 38 percent of all food grants, compared to32 percent in the week before lockdo wn.y62 Any move down Alert Levels in parts of the country that enable moreeconomic activity should redluce demand for financial and in-kind support.However, the proposals ine this paper will result in continued and possiblyincreased demand from some sectors in Auckland.vImpacts on at-risk populationsi63 The outbreakt of COVID-19 and the associated Alert Level response is havinga range ofc impacts on at-risk populations. These are set out in more detail inAppendix 1, and include:a63.1 higher vulnerability to, and disproportionate impacts of, COVID-19amongst Māori and Pacific populations, exacerbated by lower rates ofovaccination and existing health co-morbidities amongst these groups;r63.2restrictions on earning capacity (e.g. loss of jobs, reduced hours, smallP businesses affected and the impact of finances of families) and issuesaccessing support for those still working at Alert Level 4;63.3 inequitable access to material essentials such as food, hygieneproducts, shelter and warmth and online financial services;63.4 ongoing demand for mental health support services, with employmentissues now in the top five issues presenting to Youthline Helpline; and63.5 continued discrimination targeted towards Pacific peoples and disabledpeople (the latter relating to face covering exemptions).11SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEPublic attitudes and compliance64 Research carried out between Thursday 9 September to Monday 13September 2021 (n = 477), showed most New Zealanders (73 percent) agreewith lockdown as an approach and with different Alert Level settings beingapplied across the country (71 percent). However, some think there could be dmore freedom outside of Auckland (44 percent) and a third of respondentsthink lockdown should be stricter.e65 The research show’s respondents’ emotions have become more neutral oversthe past month (23 percent in August compared to 41 percent in September)and there is a decline in those who are feeling “sad” (46 percent down to 26apercent). Some remain angry (17 percent) or fearful (13 percent). Lockdownand COVID-19 “fatigue” are likely driving these feelings.e66 Since Monday 30 August, there has been a significant decline in the numberof New Zealanders who are “happy” to do their part lwhen it comes to getting aCOVID-19 test if unwell (63 percent now compareed to 77 percent in August).There is strong willingness to comply with key COVID-19 health behaviours,including new face covering and record keeping requirements.R67 Overall Police is continuing to see good compliance with the Alert Levelrestrictions. Between 11.59pm Tuesday 17 August and 5pm Friday 17September, Police advise:y67.1 77 people have been prosecuted for COVID-19 related offences inlAuckland. Counties Manukau District has had the highest number ofepeople prosecuted (37 people or 48 percent).v67.2 Between 11.59pm Tuesday 17 August and 5pm Saturday 18September, Auckland Police has undertaken 27,838 pandemic relatediactivities. 9432 online 105 breach notifications have been received andt2320 infringement notices have been issued.c67.3 There have been continued reports of people attempting, andaoccasionallysuccessfully, travelling across the Alert Level 4/2boundary when not permitted to do so. It is likely the innovation ando motivation of individuals to bypass Alert Level boundaries will increasethe longer the boundaries are in place.rAbilityto operationalise the proposals in this paperP68Effective operationalisation of the proposals in this paper will requireconsideration of the following issues:68.1 Clear communications, explaining the changes to Alert Level 2 settingsand reiterating the high threshold for permitted movement across theAlert Level 3/2 boundary. Communications will be important so peopleunderstand and comply with the requirements, including whetherevidence of having had a test or a negative test result is required(depending on the reason for travel), and to minimise people re-12SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEapplying for exemptions from boundary requirements when the samepermissions continue (discussed in the following section).68.2 Delays at boundary checkpoints and impacts on supply chainmovements, as the complexity of testing requirements at the AlertLevel boundary, and additional compliance monitoring and denforcement, increase.e68.3 Testing of prisoners before they are released (discussed in thefollowing section). I am advised that Corrections staff are working tosidentify operational options to respond to prisoners who are unwilling toundergo a test prior to release. Failure to undergo a test without anaexemption would limit ability to cross the Alert Level boundary, whichmay result in breach of bail conditions in some instances.ePART 2: BOUNDARY SETTINGSleUpdate on current boundariesR69 On Monday 6 September Cabinet agreed that the same categories ofpermitted movement for businesses and services across the previous AlertLevel 4/3 boundary would also apply to the Alert Level 4/2 boundary [CAB-21-MIN-0360 refers]. In addition, there is a limited number of permissions foryindividuals to cross the boundary for non-work purposes, e.g. to provideurgent care for a child or attend a medical appointment.le70 Between 12am Monday 6 September and 11.59pm Thursday 16 September atotal of 149,309 vehicles had been stopped at the northern and southernvcheckpoints, with 1,652 turned around (1271 at the southern boundary and381 at the northern boundary). Generally, compliance has been very high andimotorists are carrying the required evidence to demonstrate their permittedtreason to travel. Only around one percent of vehicles have been turnedcaround.71 On aaverage, Air New Zealand carries 233 passengers out of, and 241passengers into, Auckland each day under Alert Level 4/2.o72 As at 12pm Friday 17 September, 7296 companies had been issued BusinessTravel Documents that can be used as evidence of a worker’s permission torcrossan Alert Level boundary. These support 44,854 people to cross the AlertPLevel 4/2 boundary. Transport (15,937 workers) and the primary sector (9501workers) currently account for most documents.73 As of 12.30pm Friday 17 September, the Ministry of Health had received 5284requests for personal travel exemptions. To date, 5034 requests have beenprocessed, of which 232 have been approved and 3968 declined - includingall but 7 applications for exemptions to travel to attend a funeral ortangihanga.13SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEUpdates will be made to permitted movement across the Alert Level 3/2boundary74 On Monday 13 September Cabinet agreed to the permitted movement acrossan Alert Level 3/2 boundary being the existing Alert Level 4/2 permissions inthe current Order (including permitted movement for businesses and services dand non-work purposes) and additional personal categories including to visitthe dying, accompany a tūpāpaku or deceased person to a tangihanga or efuneral; and attending a tangihanga or funeral [CAB-21-MIN-0370 refers].s75 Notwithstanding the cultural significance of funerals and tangihanga, theyhave the potential to become super-spreader events. This is in part becauseapeople travel to them from various places. The Director-General of Health hasrecommended that the Alert Level boundaries remain tightly controlled, witheany additional travel dealt with through the exemptions regime.76 I consider that travel across an Alert Level 3/2 bounldary in thesecircumstances should be considered on a case-bye-case basis and that peopletravelling for this purpose should seek an exemption from the Director-General of Health. This would enable publicR health mitigations to be appliedas a condition of an exemption such as requiring evidence be carried of anegative test result (as is currently the case for all exemptions granted).Travel across an Alert Level 3/2 bou ndary for this reason would therefore notbe a permitted movement in the Oyrder.77 I therefore propose to rescinld the decision referred to in paragraph 74 andinstead propose that permeitted movement across an Alert Level 3/2 boundarywill be the existing Alert Level 4/2 permissions in the current Order (includingpermitted movemenvt for businesses and services and non-work purposes).78 Cabinet also previously noted that I will ask Cabinet to consider whetherifurther categtories of permitted movement should be allowed, after Aucklandmoves to Alert Level 3. This phased approach could allow additional permittedcmovement to address personal circumstances causing undue hardship and toenabale workers in key industries (including construction and forestry) whichcould mitigate impacts on major infrastructure projects and supply chains.Consideration would need to be given to the likely increased volume of trafficoandassociated impacts on the efficient operation of checkpoints. Officials willprovide further advice to Ministers with Power to Action the week of 27rSeptember.P79This further advice will also provide detail on industries which are reopening insome capacity under Alert Level 3. For example, in education, principals andteachers living in an Alert Level 2 area will be unable to travel into and out ofan Alert Level 3 area to get to work (and home again). This impact will extendto children unable to attend school in an Alert Level 3 area, and their parentsand caregivers who may not be able to return to work as a result.14SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VETesting requirements at the Alert Level boundary will be expanded as anadditional layer of protection80 On Monday 6 September, Cabinet agreed both that workers at Alert Level 4businesses and services be required to carry evidence of a COVID-19 testwithin the last seven days when crossing an Alert Level boundary. People dpermitted to travel for personal reasons were to be encouraged to have a test[CAB-21-MIN-0360 refers]. e81 In addition, on Monday 13 September, Cabinet agreed, in principle, thatspeople permitted to cross Alert Level boundary for personal reasons are alsorequired to carry evidence of a test. Specifically, that people who move acrossaan Alert Level 4/2 or Alert Level 3/2 boundary:81.1 for personal reasons on a regular basis would be reequired to carryevidence of having had a COVID-19 test within seven days of crossingthe boundary; and le81.2 for personal reasons as a single trip will be required to carry evidenceof a negative COVID-19 test receivedR within 72 hours of crossing theboundary.82 Requiring people to carry evidence o f having been tested for COVID-19 willmitigate the risk associated with these movements across the boundary. Theyparagraphs below confirm this decision and clarify what will be required underparticular permissions.lePeople travelling for personal reasons that are likely to be one-off will be required tohave a pre-departure test 72 hours prior to moving across the boundaryv83 For people permitted to travel across the boundaries for personal reasons, theiDirector-General has recommended that in the majority of cases, they betrequired to carry evidence of a negative nasopharyngeal or oropharyngealctest result, returned within 72 hours of their planned travel. This requirementprovides the greatest level of assurance that individuals are not transmittingaCOVID-19 from Auckland to parts of the country at lower Alert Levels. Inlimited instances where people are likely to be travelling regularly evidence ofoatest being taken in the previous seven days will be accepted.r84 Officials have also considered whether some permitted personal movementacross the boundary, which could involve regular travel in some instances,Pshould be included in the seven-day surveillance testing regime for workers.The Director-General of Health considers that there are limited circumstancesin which this could apply. This would ensure consistency with the testing forregular movements allowed for work reasons and could include either a nasalswab or saliva test. Such permitted movements would be limited to thosecaring for pets and animals and those accessing health services with anappointment.85 The full list of permitted movements, and the testing and evidencerequirements which apply, are detailed in Appendix 3.15SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEPre-departure testing requirements will be applied to some categories of peoplemoving across the Alert Level boundary for personal reasons86 I therefore propose people moving across an Alert Level 4/2 or 3/2 boundary(in either direction) for personal reasons be required to carry evidence of anegative COVID-19 test received within 72 hours before crossing the dboundary. This requirement would apply for travel for the following reasons:e86.1 leave or relocate hospital/residential care;s86.2 attend a judicial institution;a86.3 leave or relocate home on court order;86.4 leave or change home after period of detention; e86.5 collect a person leaving or relocating home on court order or afterldetention;e86.6 leave New Zealand, including travel to pre-departure MIQ;R86.7 collect a person going home after MIQ or QFT travel; and86.8 accompany or collect others (when the other person is subject toytesting requirements).87 I propose that for people molving across an Alert Level 4/2 or 3/2 boundary forepersonal reasons on what may be a regular basis, that they are required tocarry evidence of having had a COVID-19 test in the seven days before travel.This requirement wovuld apply for travel for the following reasons:87.1 care for ipets or other animals, where there is no one else able toprovidte care for them; andc87.2 access health services with an appointment.a88 There are some situations where testing requirements may not be appropriatefor personal movement across the boundary, e.g. when travel is urgent orowhenthere would be no additional public health-risk caused by thismovement. I propose that people moving across an Alert Level 4/2 or 3/2rboundaryfor the following reasons will not be required to carry evidence of aP COVID-19 test:88.1 urgent care of child/support or care to person in critical/terminalcondition;88.2 emergency;88.3 go home after MIQ;88.4 go home after QFT travel;16SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VE88.5 travel home from Alert Level 2 to Alert Level 3 area;88.6 transit Auckland by road or air;88.7 people exempt from the COVID-19 Public Health Response Order; andd88.8 accompanying others (when the person being accompanied is notsubject to testing requirements).e89 A table of all the permitted reasons for travel, and the testing and evidentiarysrequirements is set out at Appendix 3.The Director-General of Health can consider exemptions to testing reqauirements90 There may be some situations where it is very difficult (ore not possible) forpeople travelling for personal reasons to obtain a negative test result beforethey cross the Alert Level boundary. For example, the Department oflCorrections and Ministry of Justice have advised that requiring someeindividuals to carry evidence of a negative test carried out within the 72 hoursprior to travel is likely to be complex. This is particularly in instances whereRpeople are being released from Corrections facilities to a bail address on theother side of a boundary, and where witnesses and counsel are required totravel for a criminal case.y91 In these instances, people would need to seek an exemption from theDirector-General of Health in order to travel across the Alert Level boundary.lAs the public health risk of movement across an Alert Level 3/2 boundary iseless than the risk across the Alert Level 4/2 boundary, the Ministry of Healthwill take this into consideration when granting exemption requests, includingvfor personal travel, such as to visit the dying, accompany a tūpāpaku ordeceased person, or to attend a funeral or tangihanga.it92 Traditionally, the Ministry of Health has seen requests for exemptions spikecfollowing a change in Alert Level. The Ministry will design an operationalpolicy framework to ensure they make robust and consistent decisions on allaexemption requests, taking into account time required for pre-departuretesting to be undertaken, if the travel is approved and testing is required.oTesting requirements can take effect from 11.59pm Thursday 23 SeptemberrP93Adequate lead in time is needed to implement the additional testing andexemption requirements for personal travel and to ensure that they areunderstood. This includes ensuring that:93.1 Clear communications can be developed so that people canunderstand and comply with the new requirements. Communicationswill focus on the requirement to have a pre-departure negative testresult, as this will apply in the majority of cases. Communications willemphasise that obtaining a negative test prior to crossing a boundary isthe safest thing to do, even when this is not required.17SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VE93.2 People planning to move across the boundary have time get a pre-departure test and result, (the Ministry of Health advise that typically 80percent of test results are processed within 24 hours of being receivedat the processing Laboratory).93.3 Police and other enforcement officers (e.g. Avsec) can prepare and dtrain staff to monitor and enforce the changes. Given the increasingcomplexity of testing requirements, including the differential testing erequirements for personal travel, there is a risk that additionalcompliance monitoring and enforcement could have flow onsimplications such as delays at boundary checkpoints and for supplychain movements. This is likely to be particularly acute asamanufacturing increases, leading to more freight on the roads, whenAuckland moves to Alert Level 3.e94 I propose that the additional testing requirements for personal movementcome into force at 11.59pm Thursday 23 Septembelr.ePART 3: REVISED ALERT LEVEL SETTINGSRAlert Level 1 settings95 On Tuesday 14 September, the COVID-19 Ministerial Group (CMG)yconsidered and noted advice on proposed changes to Alert Level 1 settings[CMG-21-MIN-0026]. Further advice was provided to Cabinet BusinesslCommittee (CBC) on Wednesday 15 September, where it was agreed that theeexisting Alert Level 1 settings should be retained [CBC-21-MIN-0106 refers].v96 Retaining the existing Alert Level 1 settings reflects public health advice thatthese settings remain fit for purpose in the Delta context, when there is noiCOVID-19 circulating in the community. The objective of Alert Level 1 is totprepare, while the disease is contained in New Zealand.c97 I propose to retain the current Alert Level 1 settings that were most recently inaplace immediately prior to the current outbreak. The mandatory recordkeeping obligations Cabinet agreed to in August 2021 [CAB-21-MIN-0315 andoCAB-21-MIN-0330], which apply at all Alert Levels, will also be included in anyOrder moving any part of New Zealand to Alert Level 1 in the future.rPAlertLevel 2 settings98 Where COVID-19 is circulating in the community, and some parts of thecountry are at a higher Alert Level (e.g. Alert Level 3 or 4), the risk profile isdifferent. The risk of community transmission is present but low, and ourobjective is to reduce this risk. In this context, it is not appropriate for any partof the country to shift to Alert Level 1 at this time as outlined in the Director-General’s interim public health advice above.99 When most of the country stepped down to Alert Level 2, we strengthenedsome Alert Level 2 controls. Anticipating more enduring periods of time spent18SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEat Alert Level 2, CBC agreed graduated settings within Alert Level 2 should beemployed as an alternative to strengthening Alert Level 1 settings [CBC-21-MIN-0106 refers].100 The Director-General has proposed several adjustments to the Alert Level 2settings (as outlined in Appendix 2) to ‘step down’ the restrictions at this Alert dLevel. I propose to update the following Alert Level 2 settings in line with theDirector-General’s recommendations: e100.1 Increase the maximum indoor gathering or capacity limit from 50speople to 100 people. This limit would apply at event facilities(including cinemas, stadiums, casinos), hospitality venues (includingarestaurants, cafes and bars) and social gatherings (including weddings,funerals, parties).e100.2 Remove the no standing during a public transport journey rule weagreed to last week. Removing this rule will lilmit mitigation oftransmission risk on public transport to maendatory face coverings,which is a requirement that applies at all Alert Levels.R101 There are two other changes to the Alert Level 2 settings that the Director-General proposes, which I am seeking Cabinet’s views on today. Officialsadvise these changes could be mad e to come into effect at 11.59pm Tuesday21 September. y101.1 The first is linked to the proposed increase to indoor gathering orlcapacity limits, requeiring face coverings be mandated for all people(including performers) at indoor event facilities. This change isproposed to off-set the risk of increased gathering limits. The standardvexceptions (e.g. to eat or drink) would continue to apply.i101.2 The second is the Director-General's proposal to reduce the physicaltdistancing requirement for visitors to gyms, public facilities, localcauthorities and central government agencies and office and factoryworkplaces from 2 metres to 1 metre to be consistent with previousaAlertLevel 2 settings.o102 I consider that the other changes proposed by the Director-General (set out inAppendix 2) are more complex and are a departure from previous AlertrLevel 2 settings. These require further policy and legal analysis, and in someP cases, consultation with affected sectors. I am therefore proposing thatofficials undertake further work on these proposed Alert Level 2 settings andreport back to Ministers with Power to Act on options to progress them in theweek of 27 September.Alert Level 3 setting for funeral and tangihanga103 I also propose to adjust the funeral and tangihanga gathering limits at AlertLevel 3. Under current Alert Level 3 settings, controlled gatherings (funeral,tangihanga, wedding or civil union) are limited to a total of 10 people,including support staff. The Ministry of Health has advised it is reasonable to19SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEexclude support staff (e.g. celebrants, funeral directors) from the 10-personlimit at funerals and tangihanga and viewings at Alert Level 3. This change willenable more mourners to attend funerals and tangihanga and viewings.Transmission risk would be managed by limiting the number of support staff to5 (up to 15 people present in total) and requiring the two groups (attendeesand support staff) to stay at least two metres apart. dFuture Alert Level framework e104 Work has begun to develop a new Alert Level framework that could be appliedsonce the vaccination rollout is advanced, as agreed at CBC last week [CBC-21-MIN-106]. The very preliminary draft design features three levels,aconceptually similar to Levels 1, 2 and 3 on the current framework, with Level1 similar to pre-pandemic normal life but with widespread surveillance testing,eand Level 3 pitched at about Level 2.5 on our present framework. At thisstage, we expect to retain elimination as a goal under the new approach, butvaccination and more widespread testing will help tol reduce the speed andedanger of outbreaks, so an individual case will not be an immediate publichealth emergency.R105 The new framework will depend for its viability on the highest possible level ofvaccination. Vaccination, plus maintaining highly-effective contact tracing,isolation and quarantine processes, can enable us to keep sickness andmortality from COVID-19 at low leyvels without returning to Level 4 lockdowns.The framework is being built from the best-available public health advice,science and modelling. The lPrime Minister expects to have an initial proposalbrought together in the neext few weeks and then to begin to talk about it andseek public input.v106 The first message will be to make clear that a less-restricted life in the futuredepends on Neiw Zealanders together achieving a world-leading vaccinationrate. If vaccintation rates turn out lower, we would need to strengthen thepublic heaclth controls in the new framework and live with those restrictions inthe longer-term. These unwelcome restrictions would be necessary to avoidoverwahelming our hospitals with COVID-19 cases and accepting mortalityrates that surpass those of influenza and pneumonia.o107 The other benefit of high vaccination and maintaining disease vigilance andeffective public health controls is the opportunity to open the internationalrborderwithout the constraints of MIQ to inbound travellers that present lowerP risks of disease transmission. We would require adults to be vaccinated andto endure repeated testing, but we anticipate there could be a short self-isolation period either at home (for residents) or in commercialaccommodation (for visitors). Our self-isolation trial is a first step towardstesting the operational feasibility of self-isolation.108 Our central scenario is that we eliminate this current outbreak in Auckland andthen move to the new framework once vaccinations are sufficiently high. Butofficials are also working on a transition scenario where the current outbreakis not eliminated, and we instead gradually move into the new frameworkwhile vaccination rates continue to build.20SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46desaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VESeptember, the balance of the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund is$11.8 billion.Resurgence Support Payment August 2021114 Under initial Alert Level scenarios and associated estimated uptake, the dRSPAUG21 was estimated to cost $600 million, though officials recognisedthat a more severe public health situation requiring prolonged periods atehigher Alert Levels would push costs beyond that figure.s115 On Friday 27 August Cabinet agreed to increase the funding available underthe RSPAUG21 by $300 million [CAB-21-MIN-0344 refers], raising the totalavalue appropriated to $899.9 million. Cabinet also authorised Joint Ministersto draw down on the CRRF if costs escalate beyond estimates again, up to acap of $100 million. e116 Following the Government’s announcement of a seclond payment of the RSP,a further $230 million was appropriated to meet thee expected cost (included inthe table above). The Government also announced that if Alert Level 2settings are still in place in the coming weekRs, there will be two further roundsof the RSP, opening on Friday 8 October and Friday 29 October.

Managing the balance between the potential risk of exposure teoCOVID-19 with the disproportionate impacts of ongoing Alert Level restrictionsis therefore critical.s2 The key way to balance these competing concerns for Māori is to focus onaincreasing the vaccination rates for the Māori population, particularly theunder 50 year age group. This focus should sit alongside continued supportefor Whānau Ora commissioning agencies, iwi, hapū and Māori organisationsto distribute food and meet the material and other essential needs of whānaulMāori, particularly in Tamaki Makaurau.e3 Data from the month of August shows that access to financial support is alsoincreasing. During August: R3.1 48,200 Māori received Jobseeker Work Ready (JS-WR) support – anincrease of 3.2 percent (up 1, 500 Māori) from the previous month. Thisincrease accounts for half y(2,900) of the increase for all JS-WRrecipients between July and August 2021.l3.2 Māori received 71,3e00 Special Needs Grants (SNG) for food from MSD(up 19,800 or 38.3 percent compared to July). Food items and supportpackages recveived by Māori from other agencies/organisations are notrecorded in these figures, suggesting demand is higher than what iscapturedi by SNG figures.t4 Te Puni Kōkiri (TPK) regional offices report that some iwi and Māoricorganisations are addressing issues of connectivity and digital devices forchildren still unable to attend school. Fear of infection to tamariki and theirawhanau may result in hesitancy about returning to school, which is likely tobecome an issue as more schools reopen under lower Alert Levels inoAuckland.r5Continued Alert Level 4 restrictions in Tāmaki Makaurau are adverselyP affecting Māori businesses’ immediate resiliency and future capabilities.Longer-term stressors and severe effects are showing, from businessrestructuring and hibernations, through to possible closures. TPK regionalkaimahi are working with other agencies to provide wrap-around business andwellbeing advice and services to stressed and vulnerable Māori SMEs.6 A creative push from across the country is addressing the lower Māorivaccination rates for those under 50. Vaccination rates for Māori over 50years old are comparable to non-Māori rates, however rates for Māori aged20 to 34 remain markedly lower. Data as at Thursday 16 September showsthat:30SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VE6.1 48 percent of Māori aged 12+ have had at least their first shot, and 23percent have had two doses – still a long way behind non-Māori ratesof 73 percent and 38 percent respectively.6.2 Of most concern are rates for younger Māori – just 10 percent of Māoriaged 20-29 are fully vaccinated. d6.3 Daily vaccination rates for Māori are falling (from a peak of 9453 oneFriday 27 August to 5158 on Wednesday 13 September), though non-Māori vaccinations are falling as well.s7 Te Puni Kōkiri regional offices advise that while national strategies andacommunications about vaccinations are gaining traction, local solutions areincreasingly coming to the fore and it will be important to back these.ePacific peoplesl8 A significant proportion of the New Zealand Pacifiec population live in theAuckland region, with large numbers in pockets of South Auckland. Pacificpeoples account for over 70 percent of the cRurrent COVID-19 cases, with theMāngere Assembly of God Church (AOG) of Samoa presenting as the largestsub-cluster of this outbreak. As at Friday 17 September, 311 active (confirmedand probable) COVID-19 cases were Pacific.y9 Pacific peoples are more susceptible to COVID-19 health risk-factorsincluding immunocompromisled conditions, cancer, respiratory diseases anddiabetes milletus. This meeans that Pacific peoples who contract COVID-19are more likely to be hospitalized and more likely to die from the virus.v10 Pacific people currently have relatively low vaccination rates (as at 11.59pm12 September 2021, 88,493 (31%) Pacific Peoples had received two doses ofithe vaccine, tcompared to 1.2 million (37%) non-Māori or Pacific). Therecontinue to be reports of vaccine hesitancy, particularly among young people.cThis is driven by misinformation, religious beliefs, concerns about the recentmyocarditis case, and prevalent low health literacy.a11 A move to Alert Level 3 for the Auckland region will need to be supported byoAlertLevel 3 information for Pacific peoples that is targeted, clear, conciseand accessible. The prevalence of low health literacy amongst Pacificrpeoples,and the relatively high number of Pacific peoples who speak PacificP languages as their first language necessitates this focus.12 Higher Alert Level settings are creating restrictions on earning capacity whichcan amplify income and poverty inequities. Food security and financialstruggles continue to be key issues. There is ongoing significant demand forfood parcels and social services, and other essentials e.g. PPE.13 School principals have raised concerns about ‘COVID fatigue’ and thepotential impact on NCEA exams. Overall, there is concern that longlockdowns could disadvantage students in assessments and exacerbate31SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEwellbeing issues. Some needs are still not being met, e.g. students andchurches without devices.14 Nationally, the impact of the lockdown on RSE workers and overstayers is agrowing concern. Cook Islanders unable to get home due to closed bordersare being supported by their New Zealand-based community because they dare ineligible for support.e15 There has been in increase in racial discrimination targeted towards Pacificpeoples which is linked to the large outbreak among the Pacific community insSouth Auckland.a16 There are self-isolation challenges for larger intergenerational families, andcultural capability gaps identified in MIQ settings. Other challenges reportedinclude meeting the criteria to access support (e.g. food pearcels, financialsupport).l17 A need for support for elderly and people living aleone has also been identified,alongside health and wellbeing impacts and family violence concerns, all ofwhich relate to confinement to the home bubRble under higher Alert Levels andthe stress of reduced or no income.18 Church leaders, Pacific providers, co mmunity navigators, and the Ministry forPacific Peoples continue to be critical sources of trusted information fromygovernment into the community about keeping safe from COVID-19, and theimportance of getting vaccinated. These trusted sources have also mobilisedlto deliver support for Pacifeic families and communities alongside pop-updrives to increase both vaccination and COVID-19 testing rates.vDisabled peoplei19 The current ptriority issue, while higher Alert Level restrictions are in place, isthe issue of face-covering exemptions. There remains a number ofcdocumented incidents of confrontation between disabled people who areunable to use face coverings, and supermarket staff, security guards andasometimes Police. This issue is being responded to through bettercommunications and information with a commitment to monitoring and followoupactions. The Ministry of Health is taking the lead alongside the Office forDisability Issues, DPMC, MSD, Police, supermarket chains and disabledrpeoplesorganisations. The key messages being promoted are:P19.1 For disabled people and the disability community - “the use of facecovering/face masks is an important public health measure to combatCOVID. Some, not all disabled people, and people with mental healthand other health conditions may have difficulty using a face covering.That’s okay! The right to not use a face covering also brings theresponsibility to be especially vigilant on social distancing when inpublic and/or accessing services.”19.2 For the wider community - “some disabled people and some peoplewith mental health and/or other health conditions are unable to use32SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VEface coverings. That’s okay, respect, don’t judge. Those who areunable to use face coverings should, with care, be able to accesssupermarkets, and other services.”Ethnic communitiesd20 As with previous lockdowns, there continue to be concerns around the loss ofjobs, reduced hours, and the financial impact on families for ethnic ecommunities. Challenges associated with digital connectedness and a limitedunderstanding of English can leave ethnic communities, especially the elderly,shighly socially vulnerable in the context of COVID-19. Within ethniccommunities, there are many self-employed or small business owners, whichacannot operate under Alert Level 4 – a large number of which are in Auckland.e21 The move to Alert Level 3 for Auckland will benefit SMEs and isolatedsegments of communities, in particular, the ability to have contactless pick-upland delivery and to expand bubbles. Moving down to Alert Level 2 in the resteof New Zealand has enabled businesses to operate and allowed smallgatherings, which has provided many communities the opportunity toreconnect with their wider communities andR support networks.Older people22 Issues that will impact older peopyle during a longer period of time spent athigher Alert Levels include:l22.1 Accessing online seervices – some people still pay bills in person andwill be impacted by the lockdown and not being able to pay theiressential servvice bills (power, telephone etc).22.2 Food deilivery services – during lockdown, older people areencoutraged to get others to do their shopping. This becomesprocblematic if they cannot go online or cannot get someone to assistthem. Sometimes payment becomes an issue (access to cash).a22.3 Anxiety – how older people keep themselves and others safe willcontinue to generate anxiety due to the virulent nature of the Deltaostrain. Increased levels of anxiety are reportedly putting demands onproviders that specialise in providing support to older people. Officialsrpredict that demand for these services will remain high.P22.4 Resuming normal activities – the longer we remain at Alert Level 3 or 4the more difficult it becomes for some older people to resume normalactivities with confidence. Moving to Alert Level 2 will be widelywelcomed by older people, however many will continue to haveheightened levels of anxiety.Young people23 As reported previously, officials have seen a significant surge in support beingsought by young people in relation to their mental and general wellbeing.33SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:02:46SEN SIT I VETemporary funding has been allocated to Youthline to support the significantincrease in demand they are experiencing.

A total of 64 incidents (58 percent of all reported incidents) this weekwere related to suicide. e24 Providers are reporting that there are pockets of young people across thescountry struggling. There are a range of issues being reported, includingneeding support to leave unsafe living environments, being isolated andahaving no way to engage support networks, misinformation around vaccinerisk leading to a lack of interest in being vaccinated, increased anxiety, andeyoung people with disabilities facing challenges with accessing supports, andCOVID-19 testing and vaccinations.le25 Online learning/education has been a consistent concern for young peopleover the lockdown period. This included issues with access to devices or Wi-Fi connection, inadequate space at home, aRnd young people struggling toengage with online learning. There are some concerns young people may notreturn to school post-lockdown. The extension of the lockdown restrictions isalso creating stress for young people who are looking to transition to tertiaryeducation or secondary school, ays they are missing out on open days andface-to-face meetings with universities/colleges.lPeople experiencing family violenece or sexual violence26 Sector bodies have vnot reported any significant shifts in demand for sexualviolence and family violence services since Alert Level 4 began. Preliminarydata from Policie shows that there has been a small increase in family harmreports, notintg that they fluctuate due to external factors, and it is currentlywithin the cnormal range. It may be that people are finding it difficult to reachout for support, and this may result in an increased demand for relevantserviaces as areas reach lower Alert Levels. MSD is continuing to keep closelyconnected to the family and sexual violence sector to monitor any increaseddemand so it can understand additional support that may be required.o27 MSD is re-airing SafeBubble campaign key messages of “It’s OK to ask forrhelp”and “Help is still available”, geo-targeted to Auckland. The campaign willP let people know that help continues to be available while “in their bubbles”.Low income individuals and households28 Income disruption from reduced hours of work due to Alert Level 3 and 4restrictions may make it harder for some people to meet their current andfuture financial obligations.

COVID-19 Vaccine Certificates (CVCs) can be used as a tool to provide evidence thatSsomeone has been vaccinated for COVID-19. Over the coming months while vaccinationrates are not yet optimal, requiring proof of vaccination using a CVC for large high-riskAevents will support the public health response to COVID-19 by reducing the risk of superspreader events and potentially encouraging those who are yet to be vaccinated to getvaccinated. E2. The approach will need to be designed carefully, as the public health benefit of thisLmeasure depends on a range of factors, such as levels of vaccination and COVID-19incidence in New Zealand. A range of other issues are engaged, such as equity,Efeasibility, employment, access to lifeline services, human rights, privacy and Treatyconsiderations.R3. There are also issues around maintaining social licence over the management of thepandemic and social cohesion. Over time, this mea sure may no longer be justifiable asvaccination rates increase and the public health Yrationale becomes diminished.4. Alongside the implementation advice and further policy development, the Ministry ofLBusiness, Innovation and Employment will provide further advice on the workplacerelations and safety implications of requiring workers at high-risk events to be vaccinatedEto work in those settings. This is because public health advice is that a CVC should berequired for all attendees, including workers on site during the event to align with theVintent to prevent a super-spreader event.5. While we consider that goIvernment should provide clarity and consistency generally, adifferential approach toT vaccination as a condition of entry is recommended depending onthe venue and level of risk. Given that the private sector and other non-governmentorganisations couCld, subject to privacy and discrimination requirements, introduceCOVID-19 vaccination status as a requirement of entry, officials propose three keygovernment roles should be taken, with a mix of active and passive stances in relation toAdifferent types of venues:OProposed role Proposed scope Noteof governmentR1.Mandating • Large high-risk events are This is considered justified onuse of CVCs to defined as ticketed events the basis of the higher risk ofP access large with over 1000 people transmission at such events.high-risk events involved in higher risk Public health advice is that,(active and activity, such as music where attendees are required torequiring role) festivals and concerts, present proof of COVID-19that involve food and vaccination, employees woulddancing in a confined also need to be vaccinated.areaTHE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES IN HIGH-RISK Report No.SETTINGSDPMC-2021/22-324 Page 5 of 15IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEProposed role Proposed scope Noteof government• During escalated AlertLevels, a wider set ofDvenues could beconsidered forrequirements E2.

We recommend that those who cannot be vaccinated for health and religious reasonsAwould be exempted, to provide protection from discrimination, to justify any requirementof CVCs in high-risk events and venues. This could involve providing certification toenabOle an exempted person to prove that they do not need to meet the vaccinationrequirement and enabling the alternative option of a recent negative COVID-19 testresult. Children who are ineligible for vaccination would be exempt from theseRrequirements.More work is needed on the exemptions process, in particular confirmingwho is exempt and what form a formal exemption would take.P7. Public health advice is that proof of a negative test is less effective in benefiting publichealth than proof of full vaccination. Vaccination generally provides better assurance ofbaseline protection, and therefore proof of vaccination would be the stronger public healthmeasure. Proof of a negative test could be used in specific situations, particularly to allowthose exempt from vaccination access to high-risk venues. Having an alternativemeasure will prevent discrimination against those who legitimately cannot be vaccinated,THE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES IN HIGH-RISK Report No.SETTINGSDPMC-2021/22-324 Page 6 of 15IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEhowever a negative test is not recommended as a broad substitute for proof ofvaccination in high-risk settings.8. Officials are planning a two-stage delivery of the domestic vaccination certificate. Stageone will provide a paper-based certificate with a working title of the “Summer Pass” thatDcan also be stored on mobile phones. Due to privacy concerns this is a separate solutionfrom the digital vaccination certificate for international travel and will show a simple viewof compliance vaccination (or exemption) status with no clinical or private information. EWork on the Summer Pass as a tool for proving vaccination status is scheduled to becompleted by 8 November 2021. S9. Subject to your decision, we will engage with Treaty partners, community, and businessAstakeholders to discuss how government could set the direction of CVC use. This willinform further advice on the operational matters of introducing government guidanceand/or requirements on the use of CVCs in high-risk settings, including priEvacy and data-protective measures.LBackgroundE10. You were provided with initial advice on how proof of COVID-19 vaccination could beused domestically to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-R19 on 17 September [DPMC-2021/22-324 refers]. You then directed officials to develop further advice on using CVCsat high-risk events and venues, and a wider set of lower-risk settings.Y11. As New Zealand’s vaccination programme advances, the use of vaccination as acondition of entry to venues provides a potential additional risk mitigation measure tofurther reduce the risk of outbreaks. HoweLver, depending on how this requirement isused, there are a range of equity, human rights, privacy and feasibility concerns to bemanaged. s9(2)(h) EVPublic health advice on domestic use of CVCs for access to high-riskevents and venues inI order to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaksT12. The public health benefit of using CVCs in high-risk events and venues depends on thelevel of vaccinatioCn coverage, if an outbreak is occurring, and the number of COVID-19cases. CVCs could mitigate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in some settings and protectvulnerable Apopulations by reducing the risk of COVID-19 spread.13. Secondary benefits could be to incentivise vaccination and provide reassurance to eventOorganisers that their event is unlikely to be cancelled if there is an escalation of Alert Levels.It is unclear to what extent the use of CVCs drives higher vaccination rates as this dependson the scope of the requirement and social license for vaccination as a key public healthRprotectionmeasure.P14.The events and venues that are considered to be highest risk are those where there arelarge numbers of people, which continue for a long period of time, and where there is closeinteraction between attendees. The key risk factors to use when identifying high-risk eventsand venues include:• Number of people• Proximity to each other / density and crowding / whether people are travelling or livingtogetherTHE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES IN HIGH-RISK Report No.SETTINGSDPMC-2021/22-324 Page 7 of 15IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCE• Length of time together• The proportion of people that attend from outside the region• Ventilation systems at indoor venues• Presence of vulnerable peopleD15. Officials have identified a range of events and venues and assessed them for risk in Table1 below.ETable 1: Risk of an event being a super-spreader eventSRisk category CharacteristicsVery large high-risk events Events with over 1000 people where people spend Alengths oftime together in close proximity.EThese events generally involve people travelling outside theirlocal area to attend and present a risk of being a super-spreaderevent. LFor example, large conferences, cEonventions, festivals, musicconcerts, large spectator sports events.RLarge high-risk events Events of more than 500 people where people spend lengths oftime together in close proximity.For example smaller conferences, conventions, festivals,Yconcerts, spectator sports events, large weddings and funeralsSmaller high-risk events and Events and vLenues with more than 100 people in attendance.venuesFor exaEmple bars, nightclubs, smaller concerts and privategatherings.V16. The introduction of CVCsI should be considered alongside other mitigation measures andpublic health messaginTg, for example staying at home if sick, scanning in, mandatory recordkeeping, zoned areas to maintain smaller bubbles, reinforcement of hygiene messaging andmask wearing. ThCese measures may be presented as guidance to event organisers andattendees and could be considered alongside CVCs in the event of a community outbreak.Extending the uAse of CVCs during an escalation of Alert Levels17. There would be public health benefit in extending the use of CVCs to a wider range of low-Orisk venues (e.g. cafes, museums, art galleries) in the event of an escalation of Alert Levels.However, this would be in addition to other public health controls. Extending the use ofRCVCs during higher Alert Levels would mean that those who are at lower risk of beinginfected or infecting others are given more freedom.P Ongoing or temporary use of CVCs in reducing the risk of outbreaks and community spread18. Public health advice is that CVCs should be used as a temporary requirement for entry tolarge high-risk events or venues to reduce the risk of large outbreaks and community spreadand should be reviewed in relation to vaccination rates. The more people who arevaccinated, the smaller the pool of people who could be infected and spread COVID-19,THE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES IN HIGH-RISK Report No.SETTINGSDPMC-2021/22-324 Page 8 of 15IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEmeaning that outbreaks would be smaller and easier to control, and a CVC may no longerprovide significant public health benefit.Vaccination requirements for workersDThere are issues relating to workers at venues/events that will need to beconsidered in a decision on whether the government should introduce CVCsE19. Should the government set any requirements for attendees of high-risk events to presentCVCs for entry, the public health advice is that employees should be supported to be Svaccinated in order to prevent super-spreader events.A20. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has recently advised theMinister for Workplace Relations and Safety on a framework to use when consideringEvaccination requirements in workplaces:• Issues relating to workplace COVID-19 vaccination involve overlaLp between theemployment, health and safety and public health regimes. s9(2)(h)ER• The boundary between work that requires vaccination for public health reasons andall other work can be set by the Government through legislation or regulation.Currently, this is done through the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations)YOrder 2021.L• s9(2)(h)EV However, there is a large amount ofuncertainty for PCBUs and workers going through this process, because health andsafety risk assessments are dynamic and fact-specific.IT• s9(2)(h)CAOR21. Given public health advice is now that workers and attendees at high-risk events andvenues should be vaccinated, the following issues need to be considered.P22.To consistently ensure that work done at high-risk events and venues is only performedby vaccinated workers, legislation or regulation will be required. Otherwise, this decisionwill continue to be made by PCBUs based on their health and safety risk assessments.This legislation or regulation will also need to accommodate the different regimes thatapply when restricting people’s access to places generally, and when restricting thecircumstances in which people can do certain work.THE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES IN HIGH-RISK Report No.SETTINGSDPMC-2021/22-324 Page 9 of 15IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCE23. The best vehicle for this vaccination requirement will depend on the details of the finalproposal, and whether any changes to regular employment and health and safety law aredesired or required.24. There is a risk of inconsistency in vaccination requirements for different workforces.Ds9(2)(h)However, the relative levels of public health risk posed by different types Eof work need to be kept under review as circumstances, such as our vaccination ratesand the level of domestic COVID-19 transmission, evolve. S25. There are a range of operational considerations to work through, such as the division ofAduties and obligations among PCBUs, workers and people in control of places wherehigh-risk events and venues take place (who may be someone other than the PCBUs forthose workers). For example, because this is a public health measure affeEcting workers,rather than a workplace health and safety measure to protect workers, this might suggestthe duty holder should be the person running the event/venue ratherL than workersthemselves. Who the duty holder is will inform choices about the appropriate enforcementagency and approach. E26. s9(2)(h)RY27. MBIE, in consultation with WorkSafe, will pLrovide input into implementation advice toMinisters on the employment and health and safety aspects of this proposal.ERisk and benefits of a CVCV28. While there is public health benefit in a potentially wide application of CVCs, the wider theuse, the greater the risks around equity, social division, compliance and enforcement.ITEquity and social license29. Experience oversCeas demonstrates the risk of loss of social license if a CVC is applied toobroadly, in a way that is seen as interfering too much in day-to-day affairs. It also has thepotential to deny access to everyday services to people who are legally exercising their rightAto not be vaccinated. For this reason officials propose that any mandatory requirements arenarrow in scope, at least initially, and focused on the highest-risk events, to avoid anyunacOceptable impacts on people’s day to day lives, particularly when the risk of COVID-19transmission in the community is low.R30. Given that businesses are legally able to implement a vaccination requirement forcustomers, and that this could apply quite broadly, officials propose that the use of CVCs isP prohibited in certain settings, to ensure that unvaccinated people are not prevented fromaccessing life-preserving services such as health care services, educational facilities, andsupermarkets. Further advice will be developed on the scope and legal mechanism for thisproposal.THE DOMESTIC USE OF COVID-19 VACCINATION CERTIFICATES IN HIGH-RISK Report No.SETTINGSDPMC-2021/22-324 Page 10 of 15IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCE31. The more that vaccination is seen as mandatory, for example by requiring CVCs for accessto a wide range of venues (even if considered high-risk by public health officials) the greaterthe risk of loss of social license for vaccination overall.32. It is preferable that all eligible people in New Zealand would have sufficient opportunity to beDvaccinated before a CVC requirement is introduced, to avoid inequitable prevention ofaccess to events to those who have not had the opportunity to be vaccinated due to thestaged eligibility of the roll out. Officials consider that the implementation timeframes for the ECVC could be aligned with the roll out of the New Zealand vaccination programme such thatby the time this policy could be introduced, eligible New Zealanders would have had Sreasonable opportunity to be vaccinated, even if they have not yet taken up that opportunity.A33. While at an aggregate level there remains strong trust in government, there are ongoingand increased concerns and anxieties among some Māori and other population groupsaround surveillance and low trust in government agencies. At the same timEe thedemographic features of the population, particularly Māori and Pacific, has higher levelsof structural disadvantage and currently has the lowest rate of uptakeL of the vaccination.s9(2)(g)(i)This is whyE transparent and outwardfacing engagement is likely to be critical to successful adoption of CVCs.R34. Information provided through a CVC should only be used for determining entry to avenue/event, and should not be used for other purposes, including law enforcement. Apotential way to mitigate this risk is to prohibit re-us e of information collected, so thatindividuals can have confidence their personal inYformation will not be re-used forpurposes other than entry to a particular venue/setting. This should include re-use for lawenforcement purposes. Further work is reqLuired as to the feasibility of such a prohibition.EOperational challenges with enforcing a CVC requirement35. There would be operational chaVllenges with implementing CVCs in high-risk events where itis not feasible to control access, such as outdoor events where there are multiple entry andexit points. Events, such aIs free festivals, may present a similar health risk to due numbersof attendees and typesT of activity, however it may be more difficult to control access andimpose restrictions to participate.C36. For this reason, we consider that the mandatory requirement should be limited to ticketedevents, at least initially, to avoid implementing a requirement where it is not possible toAcheck compliance.37. TherOefore, these events would not be allowed to operate at alert level 2 or higher, though,unless they choose to introduce and enforce a CVC.ThRe business and events sector want assurance that they can continue operating at escalatedalert levelsP38.The business and events sectors are calling for government direction and guidance toinform their decisions. They also want assurance that they can remain open at escalatedalert levels.39. To meet this need, we intend to provide guidance to all other events, organisers ofgatherings to support them to introduce this requirement, should they wish to.

Meeting the guidance could then enable those events / venues to remain openat escalated alert levels when there would otherwise be gathering limits in place.The role of the government should be a mix of active and passive inrelation to different types of high-risk events and venues D40. In light of concerns around equity, social license and compliance and enforcement, weEpropose the following framework for mandating, prohibiting and enabling the use ofCVCs. This would involve the government taking a mix of active and passive stances inSrelation to different types of venues:• Mandating (active role)– government sets mandatory requirements on the uAse ofCVCs to access large high-risk events to reduce the risk of super-spreader eventsE• Prohibiting (active but preventative role) – government prohibits the use of CVCsfor access to certain businesses (e.g. limited set of basic-human needs providersLwhich are required for life preservation)E• Permitting and monitoring (passive) – government allows the use of CVCs in othersettings not captured above and provides the fundamental tools required forbusinesses to implement a vaccination requirement, fRor example by providing peopleexempted with proof of their status and monitor the effectiveness and equitability ofthe use of CVCs to inform government respons e, as required. The government canalso provide guidance. Y41. This requirement could then be expanded in the event of an outbreak by allowingLbusinesses with a vaccination requirement to remain open during escalated Alert Levels,perhaps with additional capacity limits. Officials recommend this could come in the formEof guidance for businesses to implement, rather than a mandatory requirement fromgovernment.V42. While any role that the government takes would involve a degree of monitoring the privatesector’s use of vaccinatioIn status entry requirements, we do not recommend an activemonitoring role.

This paper outlines a new framework for responding to COVID-19 that refleSctsthe protection by high domestic vaccination uptake.AAlignment with Government Priorities2. This paper concerns the Government’s response to COVID-19.EExecutive SummaryL3. Our approach to controlling COVID-19 has rested on tight border controls, aneffective testing, contract tracing and isolation systemE, and a well-accepted andcoherent Alert Levels system for when community cases emerge. We haveadopted a strategy of significant restrictions for Rshort periods of time, rapidlyimplemented, thereby eliminating the virus whenever it appears in thecommunity.Y4. This has proven to be a successful approach for the first phase of thepandemic. We have one of the lowest mortality and hospitalisation rates fromLCOVID-19 in the world, while having more days without restrictions than almostany other country, and maintaining a strong economy with unemploymentEamong the lowest rates in the OECD.V5. As we look to reconnecting New Zealanders with the world, we are starting toenter the next phase of our response. Our new framework and the reconnectionIwork are interdependent. A sustainable long-term response framework enablesTchanges at the border, and both require the development of the domestichealth system response. These pieces of work will move in tandem.C6. The deployment of highly effective and safe vaccines enables us to adjust theapproAach in the next phase. If we can achieve a high level of vaccinationdomestically, maintain effective testing, contact tracing and isolation, continuebaseline public health measures and some degree of border controls, we canOaimto keep sickness and mortality at low levels. Further, we can do so withoutreturning to Alert Level 3 and 4 lockdowns, and with less intrusive public healthRcontrols, while being more open at the border.New frameworkP7. This paper presents the outline of a new framework that reflects and respondsto the protection offered by high rates of vaccination. The Traffic LightResponse Framework1 features three levels, conceptually similar to AlertLevels 1, 2 and 3 on the current framework, with:1 A final name for the framework is to be confirmed.11chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:487.1. Green (Prepare) a baseline level similar to pre-pandemic normal life butwith widespread surveillance testing,7.2. Amber (Reduce) an increased set of measures that we would rely on tocontrol spread when it is moderate, andD7.3. Red (Restrict), pitched at about Level 2.5 of our present framework, tomore actively reduce transmission when that is necessary. E8. At this stage, we expect to retain zero tolerance as a goal under the newSapproach. By vaccinating, aggressively isolating, and controlling the virusthrough our new framework, we will reduce the frequency, size and speed ofAoutbreaks. An individual case will no longer be an immediate public healthemergency and stamping out new outbreaks will be easier than it is today.E9. There is much yet to do to develop the new framework, including defining thethresholds for movement between colours, and exploring wLhether it will besufficiently effective at controlling any COVID-19 in the community. Thisincludes interaction between how we use the new fraEmework, and our controlsat the border.REngagement10. Close involvement of public health officials and modellers will be crucial toYdeveloping a robust framework. The equity implications of varying vaccineuptake in communities and varying access to technology will need carefulLexploration as to how they interacts with the new framework.11. I therefore intend to ask relevEant Ministers to embark on targeted discussionswith our expert advisors and key stakeholders, supported by officials. After wehave had these discussVions, I intend to return to Cabinet on 4 October to seekapproval for public consultation on the framework.I12. We can ensure our approach is robust through testing with these groups beforeTbroader public release. The goal would be to test some important elements ofthe new framework, and to build awareness of the significant features of theCnew approach. My initial list of topics and sectors is in paragraph 68.Report bacAk13. I propose to return to SWC with a final draft framework for decisions. I willOconfirmthe date for this report-back at Cabinet on 4 October. This will give ussufficient time to do the engagement that is required, and also to link withR significant decisions on Reconnecting New Zealanders that will be consideredin October.PTransition14. Our central scenario is that we get back to zero cases in Auckland and thenmove to the new framework once vaccinations are sufficiently high. Forinstance, modelling suggests that the risk of transmission will be meaningfullyreduced at 80% coverage for the eligible population, and will be further reducedif we can achieve coverage as high as 90%. Benefits will be greater still ifeligibility for vaccination is ultimately extended to younger age groups.21chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:48However, officials are also working on a transition scenario where the currentoutbreak is not eliminated in the near term, and we instead gradually move intothe new framework while new cases continue to emerge and vaccination ratesbuild.D15. There are risks to relying on high levels of domestic vaccination and fewerdomestic controls. Difficulty reaching very high uptake of the vaccine couldEcause a longer, slower transition, and a change in the optimal design of thenew framework.S16. The future environment for long term vaccine effectiveness and the potentialemergence of new resistant variants is uncertain, and how long this nAewframework will be useful for is unclear. Like our existing Alert Level framework,it has been constructed to be responsive to varying levels of coEmmunitytransmission but it is also designed to work with a more open internationalborder. This involves choices with significant and long-term consequences.LIntroductionE17. This paper has two main parts:Ra. A situation report on the virus, on vaccines, and on the experiences ofother countries with high vaccination rates.Yb. A three part approach and a new draft framework for the next phase.Situation report L18. Globally there have been over 230 million infections and nearly 5 million deathsEworldwide from COVID-19. Vaccines are now rolling out steadily. Around sixbillion doses have been delivered, with around 44% of the world’s populationVhaving had at least one dose in the fastest and largest scale roll-out of a newvaccination ever.IT19. With vaccinations significantly lowering mortality rates, we are entering a newphase of response. The COVID-19 vaccines we are using are safe andCeffective. With about 90% effectiveness against serious illness and 70% againstinfection, they will be more effective than the flu vaccines but less likely to beable tAo provide herd immunity in the way measles vaccines do.20. Testing is improving around the world as well. New options are emerging thatOarefaster and cheaper, albeit less reliable, than the gold-standard PCR tests.The ability for tests to be processed without labs and self-administered hasR improved the accessibility to tests and rates of testing in many places.21. We expect to learn a lot from observing the experience of other countries withPhigh vaccination rates in the coming months, especially those that haverecently reduced their equivalent of domestic Alert Level controls. Mostcountries continue to have high numbers of cases and deaths and arecontinuing use of significant domestic restrictions despite high rates ofvaccination, as shown in the table below.31chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:48Country Vaccination Average Cases Average NZ Population EquivalentCoverage (total per Day (per Dailypopulation %, at million Deathsleast one population (perdose/fully recent month) millionDvaccinated) populationrecentmonth)ENew 64 / 34Zealand SAustralia 60 / 39 ~50 (increasing) ~0.2 250 cases per day, ~350Adeaths per yearUnited 63 / 54 ~400 (recently ~4 2,000 cases per day,EStates increased) ~7,500 deaths per yearUnited 71 / 65 ~500 ~2 2,5L00 cases per day,Kingdom ~3,600 deaths per yearEDenmark 76 / 75 ~100 ~0.5 500 cases per day, ~900(decreasing) deaths per yearRFrance 74 / 64 ~200 ~1.5 1000 cases per day,(decreasing) ~2,700 deaths per yearGermany 67 / 63 ~100 Y ~0.5 500 cases per day, ~900deaths per yearIceland 82 / 80 ~100 L ~0(decreasing)EIreland 75 / 72 ~300 ~0.75 1,500 cases per day,~1,400 deaths per yearVIsrael 69 / 64 ~1,000 ~3 5,000 cases per day,~5,000 deaths per yearITPortugal 87 / 82 ~150 ~1 750 cases per day, ~1,800deaths per yearCSingapore 79 / 77 ~50 (increasing ~0.1 250 cases per day, ~180rapidly) deaths per yearAO22. In the past two to three months, as vaccination campaigns in other countrieshave peaked, governments have looked to relax domestic and borderR restrictions:22.1. In some cases, exponential transmission has required a governmentPresponse. Singapore, Iceland, France and Israel are all examples ofcountries that have postponed plans for border openness or re-escalateddomestic restrictions.22.2. Other countries have achieved a stable relaxation in domesticrestrictions, but this approach has come with health consequences, such asin the UK and Germany. In the UK and Germany, the Oxford StringencyIndex measure indicates significant impositions continue, relative to before41chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:48COVID-19 (perhaps equivalent to current Alert Level 2 or above in NewZealand). Additionally, the return to the lowest level of restrictions in Denmarkis still a relatively recent occurrence, and we should continue to monitorwhether the epidemiological consequences there are sustainable.D23. In looking across other countries, we learn that there is no easy solution here.On the other hand, we must recognise that New Zealand is in an almost uniqueEposition globally, and that this starting point affords us options for our futurestrategy that are not available to most other countries.SOur approach for the next phaseA24. As we look to Reconnecting New Zealanders with the world, we are starting toenter the next phase of our response. In the next phase with a shift to focus onEvaccination, aggressive isolation, and controlling COVID-19, we can aim tokeep sickness and mortality at low levels without returning to Alert Level 3 andL4 lockdowns, and with more stable, less intrusive public health controls, whilebeing able to be more open at the border.E25. Broadly speaking, there are three pieces to the puzzle of management ofCOVID-19 in the next phase of our response: R25.1. vaccination,Y25.2. the new framework, and25.3. border settings. L26. The pieces are interoperable, in that choosing different settings for one willEaffect the need for the others. As we move into the next phase of our response,including reconnection with the world, the settings for these different pieces willVchange.27. Vaccination is the Imost important element. It is different to the others in that itTdoes not create trade-offs; vaccination is win-win. We have had tight bordersand enjoyed near normal conditions at home for much of the response. HigherCrates of vaccination give us a greater set of options for the other aspects ofCOVID-19 management. The priority order is therefore achieving andmaintAaining the highest possible level of vaccination, then implementing thenew framework, followed by border settings.OObjectives28. The objectives of the new framework will be guided by a set of principles. At aRhigh level our objective is to:P 28.1. Vaccinate – including good coverage across geographic areas, agerange, and ethnicity to prevent outbreaks,28.2. Aggressively isolate cases when they do arise,28.3. Control the impact of potential cases through sustainable public healthmeasures,28.4. Give as much certainty and stability as possible for people, andbusinesses, by removing the need for Alert Level 3 and 4 lockdowns,51chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:4828.5. Catch cases at the border, but work towards removing the bottlenecks,and being more open,28.6. Ensuring our hospitals and public health system are well equipped tocare for cases if and when they do arise,D28.7. Maintain equity in health and economic outcomes.E29. We will achieve these objectives through an approach based on vaccination,isolation and control. Vaccinating as many people as possible will help toSprevent outbreaks and improve health outcomes where outbreaks do occur. Wewill strictly control the virus through aggressive isolation of cases, controllingAthe impact through public health measures and ensuring our hospitals andpublic health systems are well equipped to care for cases.E30. Strong control of the virus within New Zealand will ensure that we maintain theeconomic and social stability, freedoms, and health outcomLes that we haveearned with our elimination approach. This will give the public the confidenceand stable environment to conduct business, plan forE events and plan forreconnection with the world.RVaccinations31. The new framework will depend for its via bility on the highest possible level ofvaccination. Higher vaccination rates giYve us more choices for reconnection atthe border and reduce the strictness of the required ongoing Alert Levelcontrols. High vaccination means Lthat contact tracing and testing systems canmanage much of the work required to reduce transmission. Responses tosignificant outbreaks will be leEss reliant on the use of higher Alert Levels.32. Recent published research and modelling from Te Pūnaha Matatini (TPM) andVthe Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR), and theexperiences of other countries, tell us that:IT32.1. Every additional vaccination reduces transmission, sickness and deaths,but there are significantly greater benefits at much higher rates ofCvaccination.32.2. AWith higher vaccination, new cases in the community would be less likelyto create outbreaks and new outbreaks that do arise will be smaller andeasier to eliminate.O32.2.1. With 90% coverage of the eligible (12+) population the rate ofR spread could be about 30% lower than at 70% coverage.32.2.2. At 90% eligible population coverage around one in 10 outbreaksPwould grow to more than 1,000 cases without domestic restrictions.At 70%, this would be greater than one in three outbreaks.32.2.3. Extending eligibility to the 5+ age group and achieving 90%coverage could reduce this to around 1 in 50 outbreaks or fewergrowing to more than 1,000 cases without domestic restrictions.32.3. Highly effective contact tracing, testing (including whole genomesequencing capabilities), and isolation protocols can also significantly61chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:48reduce transmission. In order for these to be most effective, it will beimportant to keep case numbers low, at least initially. This gives us thebest chance of realising better outcomes over the medium term: fewercases, less strain on the health system and lower reliance on morestringent domestic restrictions. D32.4. The dual wins of reducing transmission and reducing severe diseaseEcreate opportunities for fewer domestic restrictions, and a greater volumeof travellers without 14-day MIQ stays.S33. Further preliminary modelling results presented in the table below indicate thata strong test-trace-isolate-quarantine (TTIQ) system and moderate puAblichealth measures may be enough to attain population immunity, greatly reducingthe need for strong public health measures, such as stay-at-homEe orders andworkplace closures2. Results suggest that it would be valuable to develop asuite of moderate public health interventions that can be sustained for a longLperiod of time if required.E34. Currently, only those aged 12 and over are eligible for vaccination. However,children still play a role in transmission, so if a future decision enables us toRvaccinate younger age groups, this will improve the transmission reductionattributable to the vaccination campaign.Vaccination Baseline public healthY Testing, Estimatedcoverage measures tracing and effectiveL isolation reproductionperformance numberE85% of overFull 1.1612s BaselineV mitigations arein place that provide a95% of over17I% total reduction in Limited 1.1512stTransmission.95% of overFull 1.0312s C May include measuressuch as mask use,90%A of over ventilation, densityLimited 1.005s restrictions indoorvenues, support forO85% of overpeople to isolate.

Futurestrategy must be made with fine-grained understanding about where and withwhom the greatest vulnerabilities and risks lie. Even with 80 percent or 90percent vaccination coverage for the overall population, there will be2 These estimates are based on current central estimates for vaccine effectiveness against infectionand onward transmission, with an assumed R = 6.071chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:48communities that have 70 percent or lower coverage or who cannot bevaccinated and are therefore at risk of worse outcomes.36. We are optimistic that we will achieve a very high level of vaccinationdomestically. But, if vaccination rates do turn out lower, we would need toDstrengthen the public health controls in the new framework and live with thoserestrictions in the longer-term. These unwelcome restrictions would beEnecessary to avoid overwhelming our hospitals with COVID-19 cases andaccepting mortality rates that surpass those of influenza and pneumonia.S37. It is possible that higher levels of vaccination will identify unknown behaviourimpacts and may make testing, case finding and isolation more difficuAlt, asthere is greater incidence of asymptomatic infection that could still lead tospread. People could be less incentivised to come forward for tEesting or complywith tracing when they have been vaccinated, but there has not beensubstantive evidence of this effect from overseas. There will therefore be aLgreater need for broad based surveillance testing across workplaces andwastewater testing. E38. The increasing availability of rapid, cheap and sufficiently accurate surveillanceRtesting options will enable us to improve our surveillance testing approach,while retaining the more invasive, but more accurate, testing approaches fordiagnostic confirmation of cases. This app roach is possible when we know thatYCOVID-19 is in the community and are trying to understand the level of spread,rather than for seeking out individual cases.LAlert Level settingsE39. The major benefit of increasing our vaccination levels is the ability to ease ourdomestic Alert Level settings. However, even at very high levels, vaccinationValone will not be enough to stop the spread. Even with effective testing, tracingand isolation we will need some enduring public health controls, though muchIless stringent than before vaccination, coupled with the Public Health ResponseTmeasures.C40. The new framework attached in Appendix 1 will provide for public healthcontrols for a high vaccination context. We will retain the features of the AlertLevelA framework that have served us well, while adapting it for the next phaseof the response. The approach is being built from the best-available publichealth advice, science and modelling.O41. The success of public health controls is reliant on public acceptance andR compliance. We know from experience with the Alert Level controls that thesework best when they are as simple as possible to understand, coherent,P evidence-based, and fair, with a clear legal backing.42. As with the Alert Level system, people will understand the pay-off. With AlertLevel 1 as close to normal life as possible, people understand the value of tightborders and the sacrifices made at higher levels. With the new framework, weneed to ensure that people understand the value of stability. Practically thiscould mean giving up some of our every-day freedoms in exchange for nothaving to return to a lockdown while vaccines are effective.81chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:4843. One of the key considerations for the new framework is how we leverage theindividual protections of vaccination as part of the framework. Once everyonehas had the opportunity to be vaccinated we will be able to provide greaterprotection for New Zealand as a whole by ensuring people in high risksituations are vaccinated. This will also ensure that there is a legal platform and Denabling environment for businesses that want to provide this protection fortheir staff and customers. E44. How we use the new framework is as important as its content. We will need toSbe adaptive for different border arrangements, local situations and localvaccination rates. The speed and frequency with how we use the higher levelsAof the new framework will determine the impacts, length of time at higher levels,and potentially how high up the levels we shift.E45. The new framework features three levels, conceptually similar to Alert Levels 1,2 and 3 on the current framework, with:L45.1. Green (Prepare) a baseline level similar to pre-pandemic normal life butEwith widespread surveillance testing,45.2. Amber (Reduce) an increased set of measRures that we would rely on tocontrol spread when it is moderate, and45.3. Red (Restrict), pitched at about Level 2.5 of our present framework, toYmore actively reduce transmission when that is necessary.L46. Our Green level will seek to provide as many of the freedoms possible. Themeasures required, mostly at Amber and Red levels will aim to:E46.1. Support aggressive contact tracing of cases through mandatory recordkeeping in some bVusinesses and services, and in more settings at amberand red levels:I46.2. Reduce theT spread through:46.2.1. distancing and reducing contacts by introducing capacity limitsCand encouraging work from home,A46.2.2. mandating face coverings in indoor settings, and46.2.3. targeting super-spreader events by bringing in increasedOgathering limits, and event restrictions.R 46.3. Reduce impacts through measures targeted at high-risk situations such asaged residential care and hospitals:P46.4. Leverage the individual protections of vaccination through:46.4.1. requiring vaccination for attendees and staff at high-risk venuesor events,46.4.2. enabling businesses to require vaccination by providing thetechnology and legal basis to check vaccination status.47. The Public Health Response measures at each level will aim to:91chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:4847.1. Identify cases of COVID-19 in the community, diagnosing individualsthrough different combinations of surveillance, sentinel and symptomatictesting.47.2. Trace and isolate cases and their contacts, D47.3. Use targeted non-population level interventions (e.g. closing schools orEworkplaces).48. All these measures can be deployed in a localised response. There will beSdiffering need for changes in levels depending on local spread dynamics,vaccination rates, and health system capacity. However, relying on hiAgher ratesof vaccination while there is COVID-19 in the community will mean that webecome less anxious about the spread of single cases between regions.E49. A draft outline of the framework is attached for use in our engagement. This is aLhigh-level description of the measures that will be in place at each level. Ipropose directing officials to develop the framework further to add in theEdetailed settings based on modelling, science, and public health advice.50. We will hold on to the original Alert Level framewRork should the strongersettings be required for use in response to variants which escape vaccineimmunity.YBorder settings51. The other benefit of vaccines is thLe opportunity to move forward with ourapproach to reconnecting New Zealanders with the world. As with our newframework settings, vaccinatiEon does not provide a silver bullet. We will need totake steps to reduce the risks of people coming into the country with COVID-19.V52. Border settings should be the last of the levers to move. We need to beprepared for the risk associated with changes at the border by getting ourIvaccination levels high and having our new framework ready. In keeping withTthe high level goals I have outlined, our border response needs to beconsistent, Cpredictable, and fair. To ensure people have confidence in ourapproach, I am committed to a careful and gradual opening up that minimisesthe risk of backward steps.A53. It is important though that we move consistently with the changes in theOdomestic approach. Changes at the border are one of the wins we earn fromhigher vaccination levels. If we are prepared to control COVID-19 within theborder, managed by high vaccination levels and our new framework then weRcannot have, and do not need a zero-tolerance approach at the border.P 54. At SWC in late October, I will also be reporting back on our strategy forReconnecting New Zealanders with the World. In this paper I will give greaterdetail on the options for change at the border and how we will move forwardwith the approach.55. In the Reconnecting paper I will describe our approach to opening up ourborders, starting with vaccinated New Zealanders. We are already putting inplace the building blocks for this approach. We are investigating self-isolationand short stay MIQ, through the self-isolation pilot and changes to the testing101chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:48regime in MIQ. We are also building our vaccine certification technology, andthe Traveller Health Declaration system.56. An iterative approach at the border will allow us to systematically test changesand understand their impacts. Longer term, we will be able to control COVID-19Dwith effective vaccination programmes and treatments, which would allowvaccinated arrivals to travel quarantine-free without risking significant healthEimpacts for New Zealand.Other elements S57. There is a significant amount of work and investment in other areas that willAsupport our shifting to a new approach. This work is being considered as part ofthe Reconnecting New Zealanders programme, to ensure readiness of theEtesting, tracing and isolation system, the MIQ system and the health systemcapacity being prepared to deal with potential increased health impacts.L58. An aggressive test, trace and isolate system is key to our ability to reducetransmission without requiring stronger population-levEel health measures. Wemust ensure that our surveillance testing approach includes the latest advancesin testing capability, contact tracing capacity is sRufficient, and that we have anisolation and quarantine system that is fit for both incoming arrivals anddomestic cases.Y59. I do not foresee a future where we are stretching the capacity of our hospitalsand ICU beds, but we are ensuring we are prepared for an inevitable rise inLhospitalisation of people who remain unvaccinated, and in some cases,vaccinated people who become severely ill. Officials are working on theEapproach to investing in the health system for the shift to the new approach,and how investment could change the thresholds for response in our newVframework.60. In order to leveragIe the individual protections offered by vaccination as part ofour new framewTork, there is infrastructure required in support. People will needto be able to provide proof of their vaccination status, and potentially testCresults. The Ministry of Health is developing a COVID-19 VaccinationCertificate and the tools to enable its use that could be ready for use inDeceAmber. s9(2)(f)(iv)O61. Officials will seek advice on the legal framework and orders in the COVID-19Public Health Response Act, to ensure that our approach is grounded in fit-for-R purpose legislation. This includes investigation of the legal rights for employers,hospitality and events.P62. s9(2)(h)63. The new framework will have flow-on impacts into systems that are based onthe current Alert Level framework such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme, and theResurgence Support Payment. Treasury is working with other agencies to111chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:48ensure the wider economic support framework supports compliance with healthmeasures and business transition.64. Another flow-on impact of changing the Alert Level framework would besubstantial changes to operational guidance provided to, agencies andDbusinesses. Agencies will need to update advice for business and people onwhat activities and operations are possible at different levels of the framework.EIn reality, there will be iterations as we learn how rules impact businesses, andthey adapt to new ways of operating.SNext stepsA65. Officials will continue to develop the new framework and approach over thecoming weeks. I propose to return to SWC in late October with a final draftEframework for decisions. I will confirm the date for this report-back at Cabineton 4 October. This will give us sufficient time to do the engagement that isLrequired, finalise public health advice, and also to link with significant decisionson Reconnecting New Zealanders and funding for the COVID-19 response inENovember.66. Alongside further policy development, next stepRs will include the developmentof detailed operational planning and engagement for the transition to andimplementation of the new framework. Th ere will be advice on domesticvaccine certificates, as well as further pYublic health consideration of themeasures that will be required in the different levels of the new framework.LEngagementE67. We have short timeframes to be ready for the new approach, and it is criticallyimportant that the public is part of the journey. I therefore plan to ask relevantVMinisters to lead engagement with targeted discussions with key stakeholdersand our expert advisors, supported by officials. Following this I will return toCabinet on MondaIy 4 October to seek approval for public release of theTframework.68. The goal wCill be to test important elements of the new framework, understandimpacts on equity, and to build awareness of the significant features of the newapproAach. The new approach will need to be and consulted with our Treatypartners. It is important to understand how the approach will work in areas ofday to day life, particularly:O68.1.for our Treaty partners, including on marae,R68.2. the health sector,P 68.3. supermarkets and retail,68.4. hospitality and events,68.5. places of worship,68.6. schools and tertiary education institutions, and68.7. workplaces.121chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:4869. I have directed officials to prepare a base set of material for relevant Ministersto use in their consultation. This will include specific material for each of theabove areas.70. There is very strong public buy-in to the current Alert Level settings, includingDfrom business so clear communication of these changes will be essential toensure a smooth a transition to the new framework. Officials will refresh theEcommunications approach and collateral for communication from agencies. Wealso know that consistency of settings is important for compliance andSunderstanding of what is required from people and from businesses.Transition planning A71. We need to prepare for a transition approach to the new Alert Level system,Enoting that with COVID-19 there is always potential disruption. Our preferredscenario is that we eliminate the current outbreak in Auckland and then makeLan active decision to move to the new framework once vaccinations aresufficiently high. This could mean a formal switch over to the new approachEbefore the Christmas and New Year holiday season.72. Officials are also working on a transition scenarRio where the current outbreak isnot eliminated, and we instead gradually move into the new framework whilevaccination rates continue to build. At som e point we may be able to shift to thenew framework at its highest level in AuYckland, and that could decrease as thevaccination level increased.LRisksE73. Although I am optimistic about the current rate of vaccination, there are risks toreliance on high levels of domestic vaccination and fewer domestic controls.VDifficulty reaching very high uptake of the vaccine could cause a longer, slowertransition, and reliance on higher levels of the new framework, or potentially areversion back to AIlert Levels 3 or 4 in the case of emergencies.T74. As noted above, we must also remain cognisant that rates of vaccination andtransmissioCn will vary between communities. Even with a high averagevaccination level for the overall population, there will be communities at risk ofworseA outcomes due to lower community vaccination rates. Risks associatedwith population impacts are set out below.OModelling75. Ahead of the next paper, more detailed modelling work will be undertakenRwhich will explore:P 75.1. the precise nature of restrictions that would be necessary to result in theeffective rate of transmission being as close to, or below 1, in differentvaccination scenarios;75.2. the relationship between prevalence, domestic restrictions, and theperformance of test, trace, isolate and quarantine levers (crucial tounderstanding under what conditions our ongoing response can be stableand sustainable);131chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:4875.3. the dynamics of COVID-19 management in different scenarios, includingthe basis on which “Red” restrictions would be necessary and theexpected length of time under the different levels of the new framework;75.4. the distribution of outcomes, beneath the national level, critical to ourDunderstanding of the risks facing different communities of our strategicchoices.E76. These modelling results will enable agencies to provide advice on the socialand economic impacts associated with the different scenarios explored. ThSiscould include cost-benefit analysis of the trade-offs between the baseline levelof domestic restrictions, the extent to which the border is open, and thAelikelihood of needing to escalate our domestic response.EFinancial Implications77. Any funding implications will be considered as part of the fLollow-up paper at theend of October.ELegislative ImplicationsR78. There are no direct legislative impacts in this paper.Impact AnalysisY79. There are no legislative implications, therefore a regulatory impact statement isnot required.LHuman RightsE80. s9(2)(h)VIT81. s9(2)(h) CAPopuOlation impacts82. We know that the virus has had a disproportionate health impact on Māori andR Pacific communities, and that the wider Auckland community has borne themajority of the impacts of lockdowns. We need to ensure that the next phase ofP our approach does not exacerbate these inequities.83. It is possible that the new framework could disproportionately impactcommunities with lower rates of vaccination, both through the requirements forvaccination, and through using the framework to control COVID-19 if it resultedin increased spread within New Zealand.84. This could exacerbate existing inequities in the coverage of vaccination amongdifferent groups. Māori, and younger age groups of Pacific peoples currently141chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:42:48have low rates of vaccination compared with the wider population and could bedisproportionately impacted by the new framework. Early consultation with ourTreaty partners will be important to ensure the framework takes this intoconsideration, and we will continue our work on improving the vaccine roll-outfor Māori continues. D85. Additionally, there is lower coverage of vaccination in younger age groups, dueEto the timing of the roll out. These groups could be disproportionately impactedif there is an early transition to the new framework due to the current outbreakSin Auckland.AConsultation86. This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group in the Department of theEPrime Minister and Cabinet. The Ministry of Health was consulted on the paperand Crown Law provided draft advice.LCommunicationsE87. I will communicate the decisions set out in this paper after further Cabinetconsideration on 4 October. Communications will be co-ordinated with theRGovernment’s broader communications around its COVID-19 response. Key toour communications will be the importance of vaccination. Vaccination iscentral to our future strategy and many of the freedoms we seek are dependentYon high rates of vaccination. We seek to communicate both the collective andindividual benefits of vaccination.LProactive ReleaseE88. I intend to proactively release this Cabinet paper following Cabinetconsideration. VRecommendationsIT89.

This insights report collates international insights on the use of domestic COVID-1E9 ‘vaccine passes’. It buildson the previous report titled ‘Different Countries’ Approaches to Domestic COVID-19 Vaccine Passes’, andincludes insights on how various countries have managed and implementeLd these ‘passes’, including whichsorts of locations are vaccine passes required, any exemptions in place, locations where vaccine passes areprohibited, and challenges in implementation. The report is not intenEded to be comprehensive, and furtheranalysis can be provided if required. The countries analysed include Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark,France, Israel, Italy, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. This includes a mixture of countries that haveRimplemented a domestic COVID-19 vaccine pass, those that are considering implementing one, and thosethat have implemented and removed it.What is a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass? Y2. For the purpose of this report, a ‘COVID-19 vaccine pass’ is defined as a medical document that confirmsLan individual has received a COVID-19 vaccination, and confers some degree of additional freedom to theholder that unvaccinated people do not have.1 Examples of additional freedoms could be attending sportingEor musical events, physically attending a workplace or school, travelling, or going to restaurants or bars.3. A ‘COVID-19 vaccine certificate’ Vis defined as a medical document which confirms that an individual hasreceived a COVID-19 vaccination but does not confer any additional freedoms on its holder. As almost allcountries are issuing these certificates, and they are standard medical practice for all vaccinations, they areInot discussed further in Tthis report.4. A vaccine pass generally does not verify anything about the health status of an individual (unlike anC‘immunity pass’ which verifies that an individual has previously had, and is now immune to, a specificdisease).2 In countries where ‘immunity pass’ are also in use, or included in the use of vaccine passes, theyare mentionAed in the below table.Where Are COVID-19 Vaccine Passes Being Used?O5. There are a number of countries in Europe using a vaccine pass, a small number in Asia, and the MiddleEast, and some states in the United States, as well as Canada. Most countries in the world have notRimplemented a vaccine pass. Some countries implemented a vaccine pass but retired it after achievinghigh vaccination rates, such as Denmark.PWhich Events or Venues Require a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass?6. Common locations that require a vaccine pass to be presented include spaces where people are in closeproximity to each other, including hospitality venues such as restaurants, bars and nightclubs, gyms andfitness centres and public spaces such as museums, libraries, and cinemas. Indoor and outdoor eventvenues where large numbers of people gather were also commonly included, such as sports stadiums.Most countries analysed did not require a vaccine pass to access commercial premises such as shops andshopping centres. However, passes are required to enter shopping centres in France.Page 1 of 11IN-CONFIDENCEIN-CONFIDENCEAre There Exemptions to the Requirement to Have a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass?7. In most countries, exemptions include age (exempting children under 12); and health or medical reasons,Dsuch as serious reactions to a first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, or known allergies to a specific vaccine.Are There Locations Where a COVID-19 Vaccine Passes are Prohibited? E8. No examples were identified of specific legislation prohibiting vaccine passes in any setting, in any countrySanalysed.What Challenges Were There in Implementing COVID-19 Vaccine Passes? A9. Challenges to implementing COVID-19 vaccine pass policies included technical issues, backlash from thepublic, private, and political sectors, financial issues, and ethical and moral consEiderations.10. Technical issues included privacy breaches s6(a)LOther technical issues included the transferability ofvaccine passes and related information between regional and national health authorities, and also otherEcountries. For example, in Italy, there were instances of vaccine passes not being authorised to peoplewho travelled home from abroad to be vaccinated, or recReived mixed types of vaccines, or receivedvaccines in different regions.4 Similar challenges were noted in Canada where regional governments haveresponsibility for their own health systems rather than the federal government.5Y11. Some countries also faced criticism and saw backlash against vaccine passes from public, political and tradesectors. For example, in the UK, vaccine passes for England were scrapped after criticism from MPs.6 TheLpasses in England also faced resistance from the Night-time Industries Association, which claimed thattheir members could potentially face discrimination cases if COVID-19 passes were required for entry intoEclubs. In Italy moves to implement the COVID-19 vaccine pass to cover all workers received backlash frompoliticians within the county’s ruling coalition, and also resulted in a small number of protests.7V12. The financial burden for businesses of implementing the vaccine pass was also noted in Israel, with someevents venues deciding noIt to reopen as COVID-19 vaccine passes for children meant that attendance wasbelow an economically Tsustainable level.813. Examples of moral and ethical considerations that impacted the implementation of the vaccine passCinclude public protests against perceived losses of freedoms9 as well as larger resistance centred aroundanti-vaccine beliefs, and political protesters.10ADetails by CountryO14. The following table outlines a list of some countries using domestic COVID-19 vaccine passes, and furtherdetails about the implementation.RPPage 2 of 11IN-CONFIDENCEIN-CONFIDENCECountry Status of Pass: Details• Possible;• Planned; D• Implementedand in use; or• Implemented Eand removed.Australia Planned In Australia, passes have not yet been required anywhere 11 but Prime Minister ScottS(VIC, NSW); Morrison has indicated he is supportive of them,12 and two states are actively planningand to implement them:Possible (other • NSW: Premier Gladys Berejiklian recently announced freedoms fAor fully vaccinatedstates) people once 70% of the state’s eligible population are double dosed. These includebeing able to go to hospitality venues, hairdressers and gyms, and have up to fivenon-residents visit your home.13 Vaccination data from thEe Australian ImmunisationRegister would be embedded in the Service NSW app (NSW’s contact tracing app).14• Victoria: A “vaccinated economy” to be piloted in regional Victoria will allow onlyLdouble-vaccinated people to access events, facilities and services.15 Areas ofregional Victoria were decided for the pilot due to high vaccine rates and low casesof COVID-19.16 EWhile national cabinet has agreed all Australian states will integrate vaccine certificatesin their contact tracing apps,17 each jurRisdiction will decide where, how and when passeswould be implemented.Which Events or Venues Requ ire a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass?• NSW: NSW have anYnounced fully vaccinated adults (or those with medicalexemptions) will be able to have five visitors at home and gather in groups of up to20 outdoors; attend venues and services such as hospitality, retail, fitness andrecreation, inLcluding cinemas and museums; attend major recreation outdoorfacilities such as stadiums and zoos, capped at 5,000 people; attend ticketed andseatedE outdoor events of up to 500 people; have up to 50 guests at weddings andfunerals. 18• Victoria: Vaccinated adults may attend restaurants; send their children to childcare;Vdophysical recreation, community sport and outdoor entertainment in groups ofup to 50; gather in larger groups for outdoor religious service or at communityI facilities; attend hairdressers, beauty or personal care; work from the office; attendadult education and nightclubs.19 Different restrictions apply at different levels ofTvaccination and depending on whether events take place indoors or outdoors, withthose on outdoor religious gatherings capped at 50 under a 70% vaccination rateCand 500 for an 80% rate.• WA: The Western Australian premier has indicated the evidence of having receiveda vaccination will be required for interstate and international travel and possibly toAattend sporting events.20Are There Exemptions to the Requirement to Have a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass?ONSW: The NSW Government has provided a checklist for doctors to issue medicalexemptions for COVID-19 vaccines. An exemption is only able to be obtained if thepatient had a serious adverse reaction to a first dose, has a history of anaphylaxis to aRcomponent of the vaccine, or another medical contraindication (such as a major illness,significant immunocompromise, or infection of COVID-19 within the last 6 months).21 Thepatient must have contraindications to all available vaccines in order to be exempted,Pand patients who have contraindications for one vaccine may be offered an alternatebrand.22 23Are There Locations Where a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass are Prohibited?None noted.s6(a)Page 3 of 11IN-CONFIDENCEIN-CONFIDENCECountry Status of Pass: Details• Possible;• Planned; D• Implementedand in use; or• Implemented Eand removed.Austria Implemented and Austria have introduced ‘Entry Tests’ for locations that require close proximity to others.Sin use To gain entry, proof of either a negative COVID-19 test, full vaccination, or past infection(immunity) must be provided.

TheYAustrian government are considering implementing Entry Tests for general work and inoffices.29Ls6(a)ECanada Implemented and Many provinces in Canada have implemented a vaccine pass to demonstrate proof ain use person has been vaccinated against COVID-19,30 allowing some additional freedoms,incluVding access to non-essential businesses.31 Each province has their own program,with most using a digital or physical card that includes a QR code, and Quebec hasimplemented a ‘VaxiCode’ mobile app.32 Some provinces will allow a negative COVID-19Itestresult in place of proof of vaccine (Alberta and Saskatchewan) while others will onlyTaccept a vaccine pass (BC, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, PrinceEdward Island, and Quebec). 33 Vaccine passes are endorsed by the Canadian MedicalC Association, who would like to see them across the country.34Which Events or Venues Require a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass?A For many provinces that have implemented a vaccine requirement, proof of vaccinationis required for entry to non-essential businesses, including indoor spaces at restaurants,bars and nightclubs; meeting and event spaces; facilities used for sports and fitnessO activities such as gyms; sporting events; and concerts, music festivals, theatres andcinemas.35 Vaccine passes are not required for retail stores, hair salons, or essentialbusinesses such as grocery stores and medical care.36RAre There Exemptions to the Requirement to Have a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass?Children under the age of 12 are generally exempt from vaccine requirements, but canonly gain entry with a fully immunised adult.37 38 Medical exemptions for a vaccine inPCanada include a history of anaphylaxis to a component of the vaccine, a significantallergic reaction to a first dose, or myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle, whichis a rare vaccine side effect).39 Some provinces have added further conditions to the list,including Manitoba, where exemptions are available to people currently receivingtreatment preventing them from mounting an immune response.40Are There Locations Where a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass are Prohibited?None noted.Page 4 of 11IN-CONFIDENCEIN-CONFIDENCECountry Status of Pass: Details• Possible;• Planned; D• Implementedand in use; or• Implemented Eand removed.s6(a)SADenmark Implemented and As at 10 September, Denmark has lifted all COVID-19 related restrictions, with 83% of theremoved population now fully vaccinated.42 Previously, Denmark was using a ‘Coronapas’ digitalEor paper certificate for people who had been vaccinated against, recently tested negativefor, or had previously been infected with COVID-19 (immune).43 The ‘Coronapas’ was firstimplemented on April 6 and initially was used to gLain entry to businesses includingrestaurants, bars, cinemas, gyms, sports events and hairdressing salons. Mostrequirements for the ‘Coronapas’ were lifted from 1 September, except for nightclubs,Elarge events, and businesses with their own requirements in place.44 If needed, theDanish government have signalled they could reimpose measures and restrictions in thefuture, which may include the use of ‘CRoronapas’.45Which Events or Venues Require a COVID-19 Vaccine Pass?Nightclubs, bars and restauran ts were where the requirement was previously in effect.Since September 10th it is Yonly required when entering the country.

There were 19 new cases in the 24 hours to 9am FridayP1 October, all of which are in Auckland.6 The Director-General of Health’s interim advice is that the COVID-19 outbreakin Auckland continues to be of concern, and there is a need for a high degreeof caution. The Public Health Risk Assessment notes that the risk ofcommunity transmission remains medium for Auckland. The outbreak iscontained outside Auckland and there is a low risk of community transmissionfor the rest of New Zealand. The strategy for managing the outbreak – test,trace, isolate – remains unchanged.1S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V E7 Testing rates across Auckland have been higher than before the outbreak andthe numbers of workers being tested is good (1000 over the past two days).Due to the speed of the outbreak, Ministry of Health contact tracers areincreasingly discovering linkages between cases after the case has beenidentified, rather than as a result of contact tracing. There is also increasedand targeted surveillance testing underway in the suburbs of most concern dand across the Auckland region.e8 An assessment of the proposed Alert Level options against non-health factorsby officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC)sindicates ongoing and increasing challenges related to financial support,economic, social and wellbeing impacts. General fatigue amongst the public isaincreasing and willingness to comply with some public health measures isreportedly reducing.e9 Our approach needs to balance two factors. One is the public health riskpresented by the continuing spread of the virus in chlallenging circumstancesin Auckland. The second is the evidence of erodineg social license forheightened restrictions amongst compliant parts of the Auckland populationwho have endured a significant time at heigRhtened Alert Levels. I consider wecan loosen some restrictions while we see new cases presenting. I amproposing a phased approach to step down restrictions over time as part of agradual transition to the new ‘Traffic Light’ framework that we plan to use for ahighly-vaccinated population. Pusyhing vaccination as quickly as we can,maintaining a tight boundary around Auckland, and staying at Alert Level 2elsewhere in case the boundlary leaks are all crucial to executing thistransition successfully. e10 While I expect that wve will continue through the stepdown approach, a stagedprocess enables us to consider the public health advice and other factorsbefore each steip nearer to the time. Targeted surveillance testing andincreased vatccination rates (most up to date numbers are attached inAppendix c2) will continue to inform public health risk assessments and relateddecisions. We need to retain the ability to pause the process or even increasetargeated restrictions if that is necessary to manage the health risks to theunvaccinated population and the impacts on the health system whilevaccination rates continue to build.o11 Officials have developed proposals for how to relax Alert Level 3 settings inrAucklandin a staged manner towards the Red level of the new ‘Traffic Light’P framework. There are three phases to the transition. Outdoor activitiesincrease in Stage 1, retail activity in Stage 2, and hospitality and events inStage 3. I am recommending we move to Stage 1 now, with decisions onother stages being made based on public health advice at the time.12 On the basis of the latest public health risk assessment and the Director-General’s interim advice, I propose Cabinet agrees to:12.1 ease restrictions within Alert Level 3 (the first stage of three) to amodified Alert Level 3 from 11:59pm Tuesday 5 October for at least aweek; and2S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V E12.2 keep the rest of New Zealand at Alert Level 2, with further steppeddown restrictions from 11:59pm Tuesday 5 October.13 With regard to Alert Level 2 settings, I propose:13.1 removing the cap on hospitality venues and event facilities (indoor or doutdoor) and instead rely on the physical distancing requirements(1 metre) to determine maximum capacity; ande13.2 removing the no standing requirement on public transport.s14 I note the requirements to be seated and for groups to be separated inahospitality venues and keeping the cap for social gatherings (includingfunerals, tangihanga and weddings) at 100 will continue at Alert Level 2.e15 I propose limited additional movements across Alert Level boundaries arepermitted for forestry and wood processing from 11:59pm Tuesday 5 October,land that Cabinet receive further advice on additioenal permissions to supportcritical construction and manufacturing, following the upcoming public healthrisk assessment on Thursday 7 October.RPART 1: SITUATION REPORT, UPDATED MODELLING, AND ASSESSMENTAGAINST HEALTH AND NON-HEALTH F ACTORSyHow we make Alert Level decisionsle16 Cabinet has previously agreed to use eight factors to guide decisions on theappropriate Alert Level settings for New Zealand [CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer]. Thivs includes the Director-General’s assessment of a rangeof health factors (set out below); evidence of the measures’ impact on society,at-risk populatioins, and public attitudes; and our ability to operationalise thetrestrictions.c17 The Director-General had recommended that vaccination rates – particularlyfor praiority populations – be included as a public health factor to be taken intoaccount in making decisions about Alert Level settings. When the factors wereofirst agreed we did not have an approved vaccination. As we reach highervaccination rates, population coverage will be increasingly important indetermining what controls are appropriate to manage transmission in certainrareas.I therefore recommend we add vaccination rates to the health factorsPthe Director-General takes into account in future advice to Cabinet papers.Situation report18 Auckland is at Alert Level 3, and the rest of the country at Alert Level 2. As atFriday 1 October, there have been 1,268 confirmed cases detected since 17August 2021, of which 1250 are in Auckland, one in Waikato and 17 inWellington. There were 19 new cases in the 24 hours to 9am Friday1 October, all of which are in Auckland.3S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V E19 As set out in the Director-General of Health’s interim advice, there has been apersistent tail of cases in Auckland with continuing spikes. The virus iscirculating in communities facing complex socio-economic issues (e.g. caseswith complex or transient living arrangements and mixed compliance withlegal requirements by close contacts), including in five active sub-clusters ofconcern. Further, Public Health contact tracers are finding some connections dafter cases are discovered, suggesting some undetected chains oftransmission. However, high testing rates provide confidence that the curreentoutbreak is still contained within Auckland and that there is no widespreadtransmission. Vaccination will play an important part in the management ofsthis outbreak, which is unlikely to reduce to zero cases.a20 The public health risk assessment notes that the risk of communitytransmission remains medium for Auckland. The outbreak is containedeoutside Auckland and there is a low risk of community transmission for therest of New Zealand.leUpdated modelling in relation to the current outbreakR21 Te Pūnaha Matatini has continued to provide updated modelling results fromits “branching process” and “contagion network” models in relation to thecurrent outbreak.y22 Modelling could demonstrate how long elimination of the current outbreakwould take by imposing an assumed R on the trajectory from here. However,efflthis is not particularly instructive because the overall case load is relativelyelow, and we would need to arbitrarily assume different R that would giveeffdifferent results depending on whether they are more or less than one.vSimulating a move to Alert Level 2it23 Scenarios featuring a relaxation to Alert Level 2 have been modelled on asimilar bascis to the previous scenarios simulating a move to Alert Level 3.Alert Level 2 is assumed to be significantly more facilitative of communityatransmission, given the increases in permitted activity. However, given verylimited prior observations of community transmission during Alert Level 2 overothe course of the pandemic to date, estimation of the impact for reducingtransmission is not possible. Results should therefore be consideredrindicative but plausible scenarios. They also consider the impacts ofincreasing vaccination rates in Auckland, using data around current coveragePand future bookings. This poses the question whether we should set avaccination target for Auckland – something we could give further thought too.24 As at the previous decision point, with the low number of daily new cases,stochastic (random/chance) events will dominate outcomes in both modelsand the real world. This is true for a hypothetical shift down to Alert Level 2 asit was for the previous decision to move Auckland to Alert Level 3. Anindividual case’s circumstances (e.g. size of household, number of other closecontacts, workplace presence, distancing behaviour) make a big difference tothe transmission risks associated with the case.4S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V E25 In the modelling results which assume ongoing Alert Level 3 restrictions,stochasticity is responsible for whether (as opposed to when) modelledscenarios exhibit escalating case numbers, and for how long it takes toachieve elimination.26 In contrast, under Alert Level 2 assumptions, the main effect of stochasticity is dwhen and how sharply case numbers rise. In all scenarios, more significanttransmission would be expected from any undetected cases in an Alert Levele2 environment. By early November, daily reported cases may approach orexceed the outbreak’s earlier peaks in August and results suggest that almostsall Alert Level 2 simulations are not contained over the course of October andNovember. However, preliminary results suggest that if higher vaccinationacoverage is achieved (i.e. approaching 90% of people over 12 years old fullyvaccinated, by mid-November) then this, in conjunction with ongoing AlerteLevel 2 settings, may reduce R to below 1.eff27 Therefore, officials continue to advise that the modellled scenarios should beconsidered in conjunction with case-specific informeation. Emergent case-specific information should be used as an early indicator of whether downsidescenarios are becoming more likely. Under Ra continuing Alert Level 3, or ahypothetical move to Alert Level 2, the poorer simulated outcomes are morelikely to eventuate where:27.1 there remains a significanty number of undetected cases in thecommunity;l27.2 new cases have peeriods where they are likely to be infectious in thecommunity; andv27.3 new cases are infectious in the community – more likely in higher-risksettings where there are numerous, hard to trace, contacts.itDirector-Generacl of Health’s assessment against the health factorsaLikelihood that the Auckland outbreak is contained28 oThe Director-General’s interim advice is that the COVID-19 outbreak inAuckland continues to be of concern, and there is a need for a high degree ofcaution. There is a persistent tail of cases, with occasional spikes; new sub-rclusterswhich emerged in late August have provided the majority of casesPover the past two weeks.29 The last case reported beyond the Auckland Region was in Upper Hauraki onThursday 29 September. This case is a child at Mangatangi School whotested positive at day 12 testing and had been in isolation since20 September. The last time a case was infectious in the community inWellington was on Friday 20 August.30 The outbreak in Auckland appears to have peaked on Saturday 28 August.The number of new daily cases reported in the Auckland region decreasedthrough September and has plateaued, with occasional daily spikes. The most5S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V Erecent was a spike to 45 cases on Wednesday 29 September, primarily due totransmission in several very large households across several clusters. Anupdate on any recent positive cases of interest will be provided verbally by theDirector-General of Health at Cabinet on Monday 4 October.dUpdate on unlinked cases and sub-clusters of concern31 As at 11am 1 October, of the 1,268 cases identified within Auckland, theree are38 cases (3%) that are not yet epidemiologically linked to the initial cluster,with 17 cases unlinked within the last 14 days. Investigations for a link aresongoing.a32 There are 15 subclusters that can be epidemiologically linked to the outbreak.There are 12 further epidemiologically unlinked subclusters. The suburbsewhich have been identified as of particular concern are Clover Park, Favona,Māngere, Manurewa, Mount Wellington and Ōtara. These suburbs appear tobe associated with transmission within and betweenl clusters. There haveebeen high rates of testing across the relevant suburbs over recent weeks.33 Most subclusters are now considered dormaRnt (no new cases for over aweek) or controlled (any new cases are known household contacts inisolation). As of Thursday 29 September, there are five active subclusters ofconcern. These are the South Auckla nd Households 2 (35 confirmed cases),the North Auckland Social Networyk (8 cases), the South Auckland Suburb 1(31 cases), the South East Auckland Households 1 (11 cases) and WestAuckland (21 cases). leTesting ratesv34 High testing rates are necessary to provide assurance that we are identifyingcases in the coimmunity and to manage the risk of transmission across theboundary. Tetsting rates remain high in Auckland, and support there being nowidespreacd transmission there.35 Therae continues to be enhanced surveillance testing in Auckland, targeted atsuburbs of interest and transitional and temporary accommodation facilities.For example, this includes specific testing efforts in South and WestoAuckland.As at 9am 30 September, 55,123 tests were processed in the lastseven days in the Metro Auckland region, which is a seven-day movingraverageof 7,874 tests/day. As at 11am 1 October, there were 19,038 testsP processed nationally in the last 24 hours.36 Since Wednesday 1 September, 53,966 Alert Level 4 workers have beentested; with 3,051 tested on Tuesday 28 September. This includes 12,497DHB workers, 8,372 other healthcare workers, and 1790 emergency servicesworkers.37 A detection of COVID-19 was found in a wastewater sample collected fromTauranga on 23 September. However, COVID-19 was not detected in thesubsequent ‘24 hour flow’ samples collected from Tauranga and MtMaunganui on Tuesday 28 September. Samples were collected from these6S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V Etwo sites on 29 and 30 September, with results expected by 1 and 2 Octoberrespectively. There are no other unexpected detections to report.Health system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systems38 As at 11am Friday 1 October, there were 23 current hospitalisations dassociated with the current outbreak (21 are active cases and two arerecovered cases). Of these 23 cases, 12 are in Middlemore (including foureICU patients, one of whom does not require this level of care), three are inNorth Shore Hospital (including once ICU patient) seven are in Auckland CitysHospital, and one is in Starship Hospital.a39 There are no issues with the supply of laboratory testing equipment andpersonal protective equipment despite the surge in demand during thiseoutbreak.40 As at 9am Friday 1 October, there were 34,200 conltacts identified in relationto the Auckland community cases recorded in thee National Contact TracingSolution. There are 915 contacts who are considered active/open; of these 78are Close Plus contacts (94% have been coRntacted and advised to isolate andbe tested), 494 are Close contacts (81% have been reached and advised toisolate and be tested) and 80 are Casual Plus contacts (61% have beencontacted and advised to isolate and be tested).y41 Over the last two weeks, case and contact management has become morecomplex. This is based on thle communities that have been affected and theassociated level of supporet that is required to ensure the necessaryengagement with the public health advice.v42 In response, public health units from outside Auckland have supported overallcontact tracing service by leading specific tasks (including source and caseiinvestigationts). The National Investigation and Tracing Centre (NITC) hasactivated surge capacity from two primary call centres and there is enoughccapacity to manage a large increase of contacts if required.a43 The workforce in Auckland is stretched, tired and fatigued. There has beengood progress through the week to share work across the country and tooidentifyadditional staff for Auckland, however, they are having limited impactson relieving the ARPHS workforce pressures. Further recruitment is underwayrtofind critical resources. ARPHS are developing resourcing plans for the nextP two months as this outbreak is expected to have a significant tail. However,seconding people to achieve these plans is likely to be challenging.44 If there were another significant incursion/outbreak in the next two monthsNew Zealand would struggle to respond like it has in this August outbreak.This highlights the importance of a cautious approach to the current outbreak,however the Ministry and Auckland DHB are actively working to supportARPHS to manage the current outbreak and to prepare for another incursionin Auckland or elsewhere in NZ. Immediate actions include modifyingARPHS’s operating model to streamline delegation of activity to other PHUs,standing up 4 PHUs to act as virtual teams of ARPHS, and continuing to7S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V Edeploy PHU staff to Auckland. The Ministry has also begun work to strengthencentral coordination of nationwide PHU resources.45 The Ministry and Auckland DHB are actively working to support ARPHS tomanage the current outbreak and to prepare for another incursion in Aucklandor elsewhere in NZ.

The Ministry has also begun work to strengthen centralcoordination of nationwide PHU resourcessDirector-General’s of Health’s conclusions a46 In light of the above, the Director-General recommends that from 11:59pm oneTuesday 5 October 2021:46.1 Auckland can move down one step to a modilfied Alert Level 3, ande1.1 the rest of New Zealand remain at Alert Level 2 with a step down inrestrictions. R47 The Director-General also recommends an ongoing strong focus onvaccination of populations with low v accination rates in Auckland, with aparticular focus on younger Māori and Pacific populations, and secondaryyschool children. As noted above, given vaccination is so important, he nowproposes we add vaccinationl rates to the list of factors to be considered whenmaking decisions about CeOVID-19 Alert Levels.48 The Director General also considered the public health risk of permitting crossvAlert Level boundary movements for building, construction, and maintenanceservices, as well as forestry and wood products. Based on his assessment ofithe number of people involved, he has recommended that a decision ontbuilding, construction and maintenance services is deferred until after the nextcpublic health risk assessment is considered on 7 October. He is comfortablewith the increased permissions for forestry and wood processing.aPropoosal regarding Alert Levels49 On the basis of the latest public health risk assessment and the Director-rGeneral’sinterim advice, I propose Cabinet agrees to:P49.1 move Auckland down one step to a modified Alert Level 3 from11:59pm Tuesday 5 October 2021 for a week;49.2 keep the rest of New Zealand at Alert Level 2, with further steppeddown restrictions, from 11:59pm Tuesday 5 October;49.3 additional permissions to cross Alert Level boundaries for forestry andwood processing workers; and8S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V E49.4 further steps down through Alert Level 3 settings that could beimplemented in the future, subject to public health risk assessments.50 I propose these settings are reviewed by COVID Ministers with power to actor Cabineton Monday 11 October. This review will consider whether to re-open education entities in Auckland in line with the proposal in this paper; and dconsider additional permissions for urgent building and constructionmovements across Alert Level boundaries.e51 This proposal balances the public health risk factors and the eroding of socialslicence for heightened restrictions amongst compliant parts of the population. Iam guided in this advice by the new ‘Traffic Light’ Framework that we plan toause for a highly-vaccinated population, our continuing efforts to vaccinate asquickly as we can and maintaining a tight boundary around Auckland.e52 This staged process enables us to consider the public health advice and otherfactors before each step nearer to the time. Targeteld surveillance testing andincreased vaccination rates will continue to informe risk assessments andrelated decisions. We will retain the ability to pause the process or evenincrease targeted restrictions if that is necesRsary to manage the health risks tothe unvaccinated population and the impacts on the health system moregenerally while vaccination rates continue to build.yAssessment of the proposed measures/options against the non-health factors53 I have assessed the options lagainst the non-health factors agreed by Cabinet,eas set out below. While I remain aware of the economic impact of AlertLevel 3 restrictions on Auckland, I am reassured by traffic and electronic cardspending recovery inv Auckland since the shift to Alert Level 3. Pressure on at-risk populations, mental health impacts, and demand for essential support(including food iparcels) continue as Alert Level restrictions endure, especiallytin Auckland.c54 Modifying Alert Level 3 settings in Auckland over coming weeks is likely toallevaiate many of these issues. Compliance with Alert Level restrictions andother public health measures should continue to be encouraged, particularlyoas willingness to comply is reportedly reducing for some measures andgeneral fatigue from Alert Level restrictions intensifies.r55There continues to be risk of the virus being transmitted across Alert LevelP boundaries to the remainder of New Zealand, including the South Island.Regular movements of people and goods out of Auckland, including directflights from Auckland to South Island cities, underlie the risk of the virusspreading to the South Island.Economic impacts from Alert Levels56 There is considerable uncertainty about the size of the impact of Alert Levelrestrictions. Treasury undertook a full re-calibration of the impacts of the Alert9S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28desaeleRylevitcaorPS E N S I T I V E61 The number of people on a main benefit increased after lockdown, peaking at10,401 higher in the week of Friday 17 September. However, it has fallen inthe week to Friday 24 September, with 9,519 more people on main benefitthan before lockdown. Food grants increased significantly in the first twoweeks after lockdown but have fallen each week since and as at24 September are 2% lower than before lockdown. The Auckland region is dnow receiving 34% of all food grants, compared to 32% in the week beforelockdown. eEconomic impact of proposed changes to Alert Level settings s62 The Treasury has considered proposals to adjust Alert Level 2 restrictions,aincluding relaxing physical distancing and gathering caps across venuesettings, and removing the prohibition on standing on public transport. Whileethese proposed changes are expected to provide benefits for accommodationand food services particularly, as well as for the arts and recreation sectors,lthe Treasury does not expect that these changes will significantly alter currenteestimates regarding the economic impact of Alert Level 2 at an aggregatelevel.R63 The Treasury has also considered proposals to take a staged approach torelaxing Alert Level 3 restrictions, including allowing retail, hospitality andevent facilities to operate (with some restrictions), and reopening all schools.When fully implemented, the Treaysury estimates that these changes wouldreduce the economic impact of Alert Level 3 in Auckland from $210 million perweek (4% of national GDP) tlo approximately $40 million per week (1% ofenational GDP), a level similar to if ‘Delta’ Alert Level 2 was applied.64 The Treasury has alvso considered the proposal to permit additional movementover the Alert Level 3/2 boundary for the wider construction, maintenance andforestry sectorsi. While at an aggregate level this proposal is not expected tosignificantly itmpact national GDP, it is expected that these changes wouldsoften supcply chain impacts and enable additional activity for these sectors.aImpacts on at-risk populations65 oMāori and Pacific populations are experiencing a higher vulnerability to, anddisproportionate impacts of, COVID-19, which are continuing to beexacerbated by lower rates of vaccination and existing health co-morbiditiesramongstthese groups.P66 The issues raised in previous Alert Level reviews continue to persist despitethe move down to Alert Level 3 in Auckland, and include but are not limited to:ongoing restrictions on earning capacity, inequitable access to materialessentials, issues related to education and learning, strong ongoing demandfor mental health support services; and continued discrimination targetedtowards Pacific peoples and disabled people. Further detail on implications forpopulation groups is detailed in Appendix 1.11S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V EPublic attitudes and compliance67 Sentiment and behaviour research is conducted regularly with The ResearchAgency to understand the public sentiment towards COVID-19 and identifyany shift in how New Zealanders feel about the response. It monitorsinformation needs, behaviour and compliance across age cohorts anddgeographical areas. Research carried out between Thursday 9 September toFriday 17 September (n = 846), showed that sentiment has changed frome‘neutral’ and ‘joy’ to ‘neutral’ and ‘sad’. ‘Neutral’ is still the highest sentimentbut feelings of sadness have significantly increased since our July research.sThis is mostly driven by feelings of COVID-19 or lockdown fatigue, especiallydriven by Aucklanders.a68 Remaining consistent with July’s research, the issues most top of mind forNew Zealanders remain the effect of the New Zealand ecoenomy, new variantsof COVID-19, and the financial impacts on business. Effects on mental healthand “not knowing when we will return to normal” havle seen significantincreases from July. e69 Most New Zealanders continue to agree with lockdown as an approach andRwith different Alert Level settings being applied across the country. The levelof support for these has remained consistent from July’s survey, howeverthere is less support for lockdowns in Auckland.y70 In terms of health behaviours, wearing a face covering is the behaviour mostrespondents are either willing to comply with or always compliant with.lStaying home if sick, and using the COVID-19 Tracer App follow, all withesignificant increases with willingness or actual compliance. Aucklanders whencompared to the rest of New Zealand, are more consistently compliant,vsignificantly so with staying home if sick and using the COVID-19 Tracer App.i71 Police advice that anecdotal information and media reporting suggesttcompliance with Alert Level 3 restrictions in Tāmaki Makaurau is waning.cExamples of breached include people playing touch rugby, walking oncrowded beachfronts (unmasked) and holding gatherings with people outsideaof their bubble. Between 11.59pm Tuesday 21 September and 5pmWednesday 29 September, Police advise:o71.1 Four people have been prosecuted for COVID-19 related offences inr Auckland. Police have also issued 284 infringements in TāmakiMakaurau for breaches of the COVID-19 Public Health ResponsePOrder No.12. Most infringements relate to individuals leaving theirhome/residence for non-essential activity. Non-compliance generally isgreatest in the 18 to 40 age group.71.2 Since Auckland moved to Alert Level 3, Police has undertaken 4,458pandemic related activities and 1,257 online 105 breach notificationshave been received.12S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V E71.3 An increase in protest activity has been noted at vaccinations sitesaround the country, alongside a further planned protest scheduled forSaturday 2 October.71.4 The misuse of generic letters declaring essential worker status to crossthe borders continues and there have been continued reports of people dattempting, occasionally successfully, to travel across the Alert Level3/2 boundary when not permitted to do so.eAbility to operationalise the restrictions s72 Operationally, the proposed changes in Alert Level settings do not presentasignificant additional challenges. However, challenges persist in terms of ourability to connect with specific communities given their alternative socialenetworks. There is sufficient capacity for people permitted to travel across theboundary to get tested and agencies are responding to household foodshortages where they exist. le73 As restrictions on the public in Tāmaki Makaurau are progressively lifted,general crime and wellbeing calls for suppoRrt from Police will inevitablyincrease and in some cases (such as mental health callouts), be greater thannormal due to the cumulative impact of COVID and the Alert Levels. In thepast when this has occurred, bounda ry restrictions have stopped, and Policehas been able to deploy staff backy to “normal” duties to respond to this shift indemand. In the current environment, boundary controls remain.l74 The ongoing deployment (efor a full 24/7 shift rotation) of around 300 staff tocheckpoints (242 from Tāmaki Makaurau and a further 58 from other Districts)and 128 staff to Aucvkland MIQ facilities and support, will have a significantimpact on Police’s ability to respond to everyday demand. For comparativepurposes, at thie time of writing there are around 430 staff rostered on togeneral dutiets in Tāmaki Makaurau.cPART 2: REVISED ALERT LEVEL SETTINGSaAlert Level 3 – proposed staged approach to reducing settings in Aucklando75 As indicated above, Officials have looked at how Alert Level 3 settings inrAuckland could be relaxed in a staged manner that maintains this control.This would ensure that restrictions are eased in a manner commensurate withPthe level of risk, whilst considering social licence and the ability ofAucklanders to continue abiding by Alert Level restrictions. I consider that thisapproach best balances the public health and loss of social licence risks. Inprevious outbreaks, restrictions have been used to drive case numbers tozero before substantive changes to Alert Level settings are used. Delta hasmade this approach less effective. Restrictions should now be used tomaintain control of the outbreak and ensure it does not become widespreadwhile vaccinations continue.13S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28desaeleRylevitcaorPdesaeleRylevitcaorPS E N S I T I V E- Early Learning Services can welcome all children back onsite- For schools for years 1-8:• all learners can return to school• physical distancing and bubble requirements (including teachersremaining with one bubble) are removed- For schools for years 9-13: d• all learners can return to school• physical distancing and bubble requirements (including teacherseremaining with one bubble) are removed• Level 3 requirements for compulsory face coverings indoors apply foryears 9-13 s• There will no longer be an exemption for face coverings on schooltransport for children and young people 12 years and over a- Some schools may be closed on public health advice, due to the proximity ofschools to suburbs and/or clusters of concerne- Learners who live in AL2 can travel to AL3 to attend school- Level 3 guidance will be provided to the sectorle86 Public Health have also confirmed that facemasks do not need to be worn byEarly Learning Service staff, recommendingR that any residual risk is mitigatedby providing guidance to support the safe operation of centres.

Such measures could includetesting and potentially vaccinationy requirements for education workers,reducing the number of learners in years 11 to 13 onsite by bringing differentlyear groups on for two to three days a week, and closing schools or earlyelearning services in close proximity to suburbs and clusters of concern. I haveasked for advice on removing the requirement for face coverings in schoolsthat have an overall vvaccination rate amongst staff and students of greaterthan 90 percent.i87 The Ministry tof Education notes a risk that schools may see a large cohort ofstudents ncot attending onsite due to a fear of COVID-19 and other factorsassociated with remaining at Alert Level 3 keeping them home. This will havea greaater impact on learners that are already underserved within theeducation system including Māori, Pacific, disabled learners and learners fromolower socio-economic areas. While schools are trying hard to deliver distancelearning, they struggle to deliver a mixed model of learning for studentslocated both onsite and at home. If this approach were taken for an extendedrperiod,it could have serious implications for both student learning and staffPwellbeing.88 Opening up schools to all year levels could require changes to thepermissions to travel across the Auckland boundary in a range of situations:88.1 students who board in hostels in Auckland, and who are currently athome in Alert Level 2 areas (and potentially any day students who liveoutside the Auckland boundary);16S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V E88.2 teachers with an ongoing need to commute into Auckland under thecurrent Alert Level 3 restrictions, and those who may need to travelunder the new proposed Alert Level settings4.Other risks and considerations related to a staged approach for Alert Level 3d89 This proposal could be perceived as adding complexity to an alreadyconfusing system, given that it differs from what people have come to eunderstand as permitted activities under Alert Level 3 settings. Officials advisethat clear, timely, and tailored communications are critical to ensure peoplesunderstand the rules, can be supported to comply with them, and can prepareahead of time with the confidence they understand how to do so. Enabling thisacould involve publicly signalling ahead of time that the intention is to graduallyreduce in stages, for both preparation and transparency purposes.e90 Treasury officials note that under the current WSS policy settings agreed byCabinet, the WSS would continue to apply even aftelr these changes comeeinto effect in Auckland. This is because the underlying trigger event for thesupport remains in place (i.e. Auckland remaining in Alert Level 3).RAlert Level 2 Settings91 On Friday 17 September the Director-General of Health proposed severalyadjustments to the Alert Level 2 settings to “step down” the restrictions at thisAlert Level. On Monday 20 September Cabinet considered the Director-lGeneral’s proposals and:e91.1 agreed to increase the maximum indoor social gathering limit to 100and the numbver limits at event facilities and hospitality venues to 100;andi91.2 directetd officials to report back to Ministers with Power to Act onCOcVID-19 [CAB-21-MIN-0379 refers].92 Informaed by the advice Ministers with Power to Act received, and the earlieradvice of the Director-General, I propose that we amend Alert Level 2 settingsoto enable greater activity. I consider we make the simplest, most effectivechanges to increase capacity at hospitality venues and event and publicfacilities.rP93 The Director-General’s proposals achieved this by doing away with physicaldistancing requirements in these settings and increasing the capacity limit tobe the greater of either 100 people or one person per 2m2. I am insteadrecommending that rather than introducing a new approach to governingnumber limits, my preference is to maintain the current approach wherebycapacity is governed by the number of people that can fit in a space whilemaintaining the required physical distancing.4 251 exceptions have been sought, covering 548 staff in 87 schools and ECE. Of these, 44applications (covering 70 staff) were approved.17S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V E94 Given what I am proposing does not go as far as the Director-General’sproposals, I am comfortable that the additional risk presented is acceptablegiven there is no transmission outside of Auckland. Taking into account theDirector-General’s advice on Alert Level 2 settings, I propose:94.1 removing the cap on hospitality venues and event facilities (indoor or doutdoor) and instead rely on the physical distancing requirements (1m)to determine maximum capacity; ande94.2 removing the no standing requirement on public transport.s95 I note that the cap for social gatherings (including funerals, tangihanga andaweddings) will remain at 100.ePART 3: BOUNDARY SETTINGSlUpdate on current boundariese96 On Monday 6 September Cabinet agreed that the same categories ofRpermitted movement for businesses and services across the previous AlertLevel 4/3 boundary would also apply to the Alert Level 3/2 boundary [CAB-21-MIN-0360 refers]. In addition, a limited number of permissions for individualsto cross the boundary for non-work purposes, e.g. to provide urgent care for aychild or attend a medical appointment were agreed.l97 Ministers have subsequently agreed to implement a regime of pre-departureeand surveillance testing for people crossing boundaries for personal reasonand to add more permissions. Appendix 3 details all permissions for crossingvAlert Level boundaries, and the testing and evidentiary requirements.98 Between 12ami Monday 6 September and 11.59pm Wednesdayt29 September a total of 368,079 vehicles had been stopped at the northernand southcern checkpoints. Of these, 6,039 vehicles have been turned around(4,735 at the southern boundary and 1,304 at the northern boundary).a99 Generally, compliance has been high and motorists are carrying the requiredoevidence to demonstrate their permitted reason to travel. Overall, onlyaround 1% of vehicles have been turned around. Compliance is lower forheavy motor vehicles, with 4.2% of heavy vehicles turned around.rP100On average, Air New Zealand carries 252 passengers out of, and 328passengers into, Auckland under Alert Level 3/2 settings.101 As at 12pm Wednesday 29 September, 9,300 businesses or 56,000 workershad been issued Business Travel Documents. Transport (21,000 workers)and the primary sector (11,000 workers) account for most documents.102 As of 9am Wednesday 29 September, the Ministry of Health hadreceived 10,654 requests for personal travel exemptions. 9,046 requests havebeen processed, of which 1,162 have been approved.18S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V EAdditional permissions for key industries103 On 13 September, Cabinet noted that following Auckland moving to AlertLevel 3, I would ask Cabinet to consider whether further permissions for travelacross the Alert Level 3/2 boundary should be allowed to enable someworkers in key industries to travel, in order to limit impacts on major dinfrastructure projects and supply chains [Cab-21-Min-0370 refers].e104 It is timely to consider these additional permissions, as they relate to forestryand wood processing and critical construction and infrastructure. Specifically,spermissions could be expanded to include:a104.1 Building and construction activity focused on nationally importantinfrastructure that contributes to other government priority projects,including classrooms, social housing, defence and ecorrections facilities.104.2 Forestry and wood product processing for whlich the travel betweenalert level areas is reasonably necessary toe enable the service to beprovided and that the provision of the service cannot reasonably bedelayed without substantial implications for the supply chain.R105 The Director General also considered the public health risk of permitting theseadditional boundary movements. He recommended expanding thepermissions to cover forestry and wood processing, but that a decision onybuilding and construction movements is deferred until after the public healthrisk assessment on Thursday 7 October.le106 The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) considers thatthere could be merit in enabling building and construction of infrastructure thatvcontributes to certain government priority projects to take place. This could bedone by explicitly providing for those priority projects in the Order.5it107 MBIE will work to confirm proposed permissions and potential numbers ofcworkers affected, and will provide advice to the next Alert Level discussion.aForestry and Wood Processingo108 Allowing forestry and wood product processing for necessary tasks thatcannot delayed without substantial implications for the supply chain willrenable critical functions to continue, including construction and housing, tradeand sanitary items. It will assist with the immediate, significant constraints onPthe supply of forestry products.109 MPI estimates around 150 to 300 workers would need to cross the boundaryfor work at this point in the season. Some workers do commute, but otherscome to an area to perform specific tasks such as harvesting, which meansthey remain in the area for several days at a time.5 Indicative projects include: Waikeria prison construction; maintenance and construction of buildings / wards athospitals not currently permitted; construction of classrooms for schools (where needed to meet anticipateddemand); Major government approved programmes for public housing (e.g. the Kāinga Ora build programme andAuckland City Mission HomeGround)19S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28desaeleRylevitcaorPS E N S I T I V EAmount remaining in appropriations$152 million $224 millionat 29 SeptemberdeWage Subsidy Scheme August 2021s115 The third payment for the WSSAUG21 opened on Friday 17 September andclosed on Thursday 30 September [CAB-21-MIN-0373 refers].

Cabinet agreed to drawdown $650million from the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund (CRRF) for furthercosts of the WSSAUG21, and deleg ated authority to Joint Ministers to drawdown up to $2,000 million from the CRRF for future payments under theyWSSAUG21 [CAB-21-MIN-0392 refers]. As at Wednesday 29 September, thebalance of the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund is $11.1 billion.leResurgence Support Payment August 2021v117 Under initial alert level scenarios and associated estimated uptake, theRSPAUG21 was estimated to cost $600 million, though officials recognisedithat a more severe public health situation requiring prolonged periods atthigher Alert Levels would push costs beyond that figure.c118 On Monday 27 August Cabinet agreed to increase the funding available underthe RaSPAUG21 by $300 million [CAB-21-MIN-0344 refers], raising the totalvalue appropriated to $899.9 million. Cabinet also authorised Joint Ministersoto draw down on the CRRF if costs escalate beyond estimates again, up to acap of $100 million.r119Following the Government’s announcement of a second payment of the RSP,Pa further $230 million was appropriated to meet the expected cost (included inthe table above). The Government also announced that if Alert Level 2 orhigher settings are still in place in the coming weeks, there will be two furtherrounds of the RSP, opening on Friday 8 October and Friday 29 October.Subject to the Alert Levels in place at the time, the third and fourth rounds ofthe RSP are estimated to cost between $100 million - $200 million, and $40million - $200 million respectively.7 Note the $2,723 million represents actual payments made.

Managing the balance between the potential risk of exposure toCOVID-19 with the disproportionate and compounding impacts of ongoingsAlert Level restrictions is therefore critical.a2 The key way to balance these competing concerns for Māori is to focus onincreasing the vaccination rates for the Māori population, particularly for theeunder 50-year old age group. Creative, innovative, and local strategies toaddress lower Māori vaccination rates continue. See Appendix 2 forlinformation about vaccination rates.e3 Actively and collaboratively decreasing barriers to vaccinations should sitalongside continued and augmented supporRt for Whānau Ora commissioningagencies, iwi, hapū and Māori organisations to distribute food and meet thematerial and other essential needs of whānau Māori, particularly in TāmakiMakaurau as Alert Level 3 continues .y4 Issues of school attendance, attrition rates and possible educational delayscaused by lack of schooling lduring extended lockdown will continue to be anissue of major concern fore Māori, with existing educational disparities beingexacerbated because of continued lack of access to school, variable accessto connectivity and dvigital devices, and overcrowding in some households.Strategies to compensate for this will need to form a key part of the post-lockdown responsei. Local responses have been shown to be most effective forMāori. tc5 Fear of infection to tamariki and their whānau may result in hesitancy aboutreturaning to school, although the Ministry of Education has identified that earlyweekly attendance data from regions that have moved back to Alert Level 2show similar patterns of attendance to the week before lockdown.o6 Continued Alert Level 3 restrictions in Tāmaki Makaurau are weakening Māorirbusinessresiliency and future capabilities. There are concerns about theirP ability and resources to ‘bounce-back’ and resume operations at Level 3 andlower. Fixed overhead costs are restraining business viability and futuresupports will need to be more agile, bespoke, and tailored to needs ofindividual businesses. Tied to business strains are the increasing indicators ofMāori unemployment. Responsive, localised, and specific solutions arerequired to address these double and combined concerns – reduced Māoribusiness capabilities and augmented unemployment.28S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V EPacific peoples7 A significant proportion of the New Zealand Pacific population live in theAuckland region, with large numbers in pockets of South Auckland. At itspeak, Pacific peoples account for over 70% of the current COVID-19 cases,with the Māngere Assembly of God Church (AOG) of Samoa presenting asdthe largest sub-cluster of this outbreak.e8 Pacific peoples are more susceptible to COVID-19 health risk-factorsincluding immunocompromised conditions, cancer, respiratory diseases andsdiabetes. This means that Pacific peoples who contract COVID-19 are morelikely to be hospitalized and more likely to die from the virus.a9 Pacific people currently have relatively low vaccination rates (see table inAppendix 2). There continue to be reports of vaccine hesietancy, particularlyamong young people. This is driven by misinformation, religious beliefs,concerns about the recent myocarditis case, and prevalent low health literacy.le10 Church leaders, Pacific providers, community navigators, and the Ministry forPacific Peoples continue to be critical sources of trusted information fromRgovernment into the community about keeping safe from COVID-19, and theimportance of getting vaccinated. These trusted sources have also mobilisedto deliver support for Pacific families and communities alongside pop-updrives to increase both vaccination and COVID-19 testing rates.y11 Higher Alert Level settings are creating restrictions on earning capacity whichlcan amplify income and poverty inequities. Food security and financialestruggles continue to be key issues. There is ongoing significant demand forfood parcels and social services, and other essentials e.g. PPE.v12 School principals have raised concerns about ‘COVID fatigue’ and theipotential impact on NCEA exams. Overall, there is concern that longtlockdowns could disadvantage students in assessments and exacerbatecwellbeing issues. Some needs are still not being met, e.g. students andchurches without devices.a13 Nationally, the impact of the lockdown on RSE workers and overstayers is aogrowing concern. Cook Islanders unable to get home due to closed bordersare being supported by their New Zealand-based community because theyrare ineligible for support.P14There has been in increase in racial discrimination targeted towards Pacificpeoples which is linked to the large outbreak among the Pacific community inSouth Auckland. There are self-isolation challenges for largerintergenerational families, and cultural capability gaps identified in MIQ. Aneed for support for elderly and people living alone has also been identified,alongside health and wellbeing impacts and family violence concerns, all ofwhich relate to confinement to the home bubble under higher Alert Levels andthe stress of reduced or no income.29S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V EDisabled people15 The current priority issue, while higher Alert Level restrictions are in place, isthe issue of face-covering exemptions. There are still incidents ofconfrontation between disabled people who are unable to use face coverings,and supermarket staff, security guards and sometimes Police. This issue isdbeing responded to through better communications and information with acommitment to monitoring and follow up actions. The Ministry of Health isetaking the lead alongside the Office for Disability Issues, DPMC, MSD, Police,supermarket chains and disabled peoples organisations.sEthnic communitiesa16 As with previous lockdowns, there continue to be concerns around the loss ofjobs, reduced hours, and the financial impact on families feor ethniccommunities. Challenges associated with digital connectedness and a limitedunderstanding of English can leave ethnic communilties, especially the elderly,highly socially vulnerable in the context of COVIDe-19.17 The move to Alert Level 3 for Auckland has benefitted SMEs and isolatedRsegments of communities, in particular, the ability to have contactless pick-upand delivery and to expand bubbles. Progressively loosening restrictions, inline with public health objectives, wil l also enable a number of ethnicbusinesses, particularly SMEs, iny the retail, hospitality and beauty servicessectors to reopen. Moving down to Alert Level 2 in the rest of New Zealandhas enabled businesses to olperate and allowed small gatherings, which hasprovided many communitiees the opportunity to reconnect with their widercommunities and support networks.vOlder peoplei18 Issues that wtill impact older people during a longer period of time spent athigher Alecrt Levels include:18.1 Accessing online services – some people still pay bills in person andawillbe impacted by the lockdown and not being able to pay theiressential service bills (power, telephone etc).o18.2 Food delivery services – during lockdown, older people arer encouraged to get others to do their shopping. This becomesP problematic if they cannot go online or cannot get someone to assistthem. Sometimes payment becomes an issue (access to cash).18.3 Anxiety and isolation – how older people keep themselves and otherssafe will continue to generate anxiety due to the virulent nature of theDelta strain. Increased levels of anxiety are reportedly putting demandson providers that specialise in providing support to older people.Officials predict that demand for these services will remain high.30S E N S I T I V E9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-04 13:32:28S E N S I T I V E18.4 Resuming normal activities – the longer we remain at Alert Level 3 or 4the more difficult it becomes for some older people to resume normalactivities with confidence.Young peopled19 As reported previously, officials have seen an increase in support beingsought by young people in relation to their mental and general wellbeing. Weeare hearing some concerns about parental wellbeing, especially if there hasbeen job loss, which can have flow-on effects that will test the resilience ofsyoung people.a20 Ongoing alert levels and travel restrictions can have a continuing impact onmental health, especially for people with pre-existing vulnerabilities. TheeMinistry of Health COVID-19 Health and Wellbeing Survey (the Survey)showed that total population anxiety and depression levels increased to 15%in the first week of Alert level 4, which was approximlately twice pre-pandemicelevels. These are now tracking downwards but remain elevated at around12%. Overall, a suite of indicators of distress measured by the Survey havebeen gradually trending down over the four Rweeks studied to date (21September).21 After an initial increase in Need to ta lk? 1737 contacts following the move toAlert Level 4, there has been a deycrease back to prior levels and NationalTelehealth Service daily call volumes for mental health and addiction helplinesare below those for the samel day last year.e22 Youthline has reported a 12% decrease in the total number of contacts for thisweek compared to lavst week. There have been increases in specific areas, forexample, the number of texts sent and received by the Helpline increased by4%, from 5,902i texts sent and received last week, to 6,151 texts sent andreceived thist week.c23 The top five presenting issues to the Youthline Helpline, in order offrequaency9, were: Fear and Anxiety; Suicide; Depression and Sadness; Self-Harm; and Relationships - Family. There were 103 incidents reported10 thisweek, a 7% decrease from the previous reporting period. 62 incidentsoreportedthis week were related to suicide. Of the total number of incidentsreported, 85 required no external intervention and 18 required externalrintervention.P24The Ministry of Health is continuing to work with the Mental Health Foundationof New Zealand to provide a targeted time-limited psychosocial wellbeingcampaign for Auckland.25 Online learning/education has been a consistent concern for young peopleover the lockdown period.

The extension of the lockdown restrictions isalso creating stress for young people who are looking to transition to tertiaryeducation or secondary school, as they are missing out on open days andface-to-face meetings with universities/colleges. dPeople experiencing family violence or sexual violencee26 Sector bodies have not reported any significant shifts in demand for sexualsviolence and family violence services since Alert Level 4 began. Preliminarydata from Police shows that there has been a small increase in family harmareports, noting that they fluctuate due to external factors, and it is currentlywithin the normal range. It is difficult to count an escalation in demand foreservices, however historically the impacts of an event like COVID-19outbreaks may not be immediately evident. It may be that people are finding itdifficult to reach out for support, and this may result lin an increased demandfor relevant services as areas reach lower Alert Leevels.27 MSD is re-airing SafeBubble campaign key Rmessages of “It’s OK to ask forhelp” and “Help is still available”, geo-targeted to Auckland.

AAlignment with Government PrioritiesE2 This paper concerns the Government’s response to COVID-19.LSummaryE3 Our approach to controlling COVID-19 has rested on tight border controls, aneffective testing, contract tracing and isolation system, and a well-acceptedRand coherent Alert Levels system for when community cases emerge. Wehave adopted a strategy of rapidly implementing significant restrictions forshort periods of time, thereby eliminating the virus whenever it appears in theYcommunity.4 This has proven to be a successLful approach for the first phase of thepandemic. We have one of the world’s lowest mortality and hospitalisationErates from COVID-19, while maintaining more days without restrictions and astrong economy, with unemployment among the lowest rates in the OECD.V5 Yet there have been disproportionate impacts. Businesses have suffered fromlockdowns, reducIed tourism, lack of access to skilled migrants, anddisconnection Twith the rest of the world. Our Māori and Pacific communities inAuckland have borne the largest health and social impacts from outbreaksCthat have occurred, and there have been significant social impacts on thoseseparated by the border measures, including less contact with their families.A6 The deployment of highly effective and safe vaccines enables us to adjust ourapproach in the next phase, as we look to enable New Zealanders toOreconnectwith the world. High vaccination rates will create more options forboth domestic measures and border settings. With our new framework toRcontrol COVID-19, then we can start to change our risk tolerance at theborder. Further, we can do so without relying on widespread Alert Level 3 andP 4 lockdowns, and with less intrusive public health controls.7 Our new framework for domestic controls and the reconnection work areinterdependent. A domestic response framework that is sustainable in thelong-term enables changes at the border, and both require the developmentof the domestic health system. These pieces of work will therefore move intandem.11chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVENew framework8 This paper presents the outline of a new framework that reflects and respondsto the protection offered by high rates of vaccination. The Traffic LightResponse Framework1 features three levels, with: D8.1 Green (Prepare) a baseline level similar to pre-pandemic normal life butEwith widespread surveillance testing,8.2 Amber (Control) an increased set of measures that we would rely on Stocontrol spread when it is moderate, andA8.3 Red (Reduce), pitched at about Level 2.5 of our present framework, tomore actively reduce transmission when that is necessary.E9 By vaccinating, effectively testing, tracing and isolating, and controlling thevirus through our new framework, we will reduce the freqLuency, size andspeed of outbreaks. An individual case will no longer be an immediate publichealth emergency and stamping out new outbreaksE will be easier than it istoday.R10 Importantly, at all levels of the new framework, businesses and schoolsremain open, and people are not required to stay home. The framework couldbe deployed at a regional level, but wiYth less focus on a response to everysingle case there would be less need for inter-regional boundaries.L11 To enable us to maximise the benefits of greater vaccination rates and allowgreater freedoms and increased economic activity I propose to use proof ofEvaccination requirements in some domestic settings through a COVID-19Vaccination Certificate (CVC).V12 There is much yet to do to develop the new framework, including defining theIthresholds for movement between levels on the framework, and exploring theTexact set of measures at each level that will be sufficiently effective atcontrolling any COVID-19 in the community. This includes interaction betweenChow we use the new framework, and our controls at the border.AEngagement13 OContinued close involvement of public health officials and modellers is crucialto developing a robust framework. The equity implications of varying vaccineuptake in communities and varying access to technology will also need carefulRexploration as to how they interact with the new framework.P 14 Targeted discussions led by Ministers have been undertaken with our expertadvisors, Treaty partners and key stakeholders, supported by officials.Feedback from these sectors has been incorporated into this paper. On thewhole feedback was positive about the intent of the new framework. Officialswill continue to engage with external stakeholders as they develop the finalframework.1 A final name for the framework is to be confirmed.21chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVEReport back15 I propose to return to Cabinet on 26 October to seek agreement to the newframework. This will allow us time to develop its details, and also to link withsignificant decisions on Reconnecting New Zealanders that will be considered Dat the same Cabinet meeting.ETransition16 It is becoming apparent that achieving zero cases in this current outbreakSwould require an indefinite period of restrictions and is unlikely to besuccessful. A17 At the same time, vaccination rates are not yet high enough. An uncontrolledEoutbreak would have unacceptable impacts on our health system and onunvaccinated New Zealanders in the groups most susceptible to COVID-19.L18 Together this means that we will need to use the current Alert Level system,Ebut move gradually into the new Traffic Light framework while new casescontinue to emerge and vaccination rates build over October and November.R19 There are some risks in this approach. We are relying on high levels ofdomestic vaccination to enable fewer do mestic controls. Difficulty reachingvery high uptake of the vaccine could Ycause a longer, slower transition, and achange in the design of the new framework to make it more stringent toprotect the unvaccinated populatLion.20 The longer-term environmenEt is uncertain, including on vaccine effectiveness,and the emergence of new variants, new technologies, and new treatments.The Traffic Light frameVwork has been constructed to be responsive for a moredynamic picture with some low levels of community transmission, whileworking towards Ia more open border. We therefore expect the framework toserve us for soTme time. But we will need to continue to keep all our COVID-19control measures under active review to be sure that they respondappropriaCtely to the changing circumstances in which we find ourselves.IntroductionA21 This paper has two main parts:Oa.A situation report on the virus, vaccines, and the experiences of othercountries with high vaccination rates.Rb. A three part approach and a new draft framework for the next phase.PSituation report22 Globally there have been over 230 million confirmed infections and nearly 5million deaths worldwide from COVID-19. The total including unreportedinfections and deaths would be even higher. Vaccines are now rolling outsteadily. Around six billion doses have been delivered, with around 44% of theworld’s population having had at least one dose in the fastest and largestscale roll-out of new vaccines ever.31chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVE23 With vaccinations significantly lowering mortality rates, we are entering a newphase of the response. The COVID-19 vaccines we are using are safe andeffective. With about 90% effectiveness against serious illness and 70%against infection, they will be more effective than the flu vaccines but lesslikely to be able to provide herd immunity in the way measles vaccines do. D24 Testing is improving around the world as well. New options are emerging that Eare faster and cheaper, albeit less accurate, than the gold-standard PCRtests. The ability for tests to be processed without labs and self-administeredShas improved the accessibility to tests and rates of testing in many places.A25 We expect to learn a lot from observing the experience of other countries withhigh vaccination rates in the coming months, especially those that haveErecently reduced their equivalent of domestic Alert Level controls. Mostcountries continue to have high numbers of cases and deaths and areLcontinuing use of significant domestic restrictions despite high rates ofvaccination (and higher rates of infection acquired immunity) as shown in theEtable below.RCountry Vaccination Average Cases Average NZ Population EquivalentCoverage (total per Day (per Daily (if recent monthly trendspopulation %, at million Deaths were sustained for a year)least one population (perYdose/fully recent month) millionvaccinated) populationL recentmonth)ENew 67 / 38ZealandVAustralia 63 / 42 ~50 (increasing) ~0.2 250 cases per day, ~350deaths per yearITUnited 64 / 55 ~400 (recently ~4 2,000 cases per day,States increased) ~7,500 deaths per yearCIsrael 69 / 64 ~1,000 ~3 5,000 cases per day,~5,000 deaths per yearAUnited 71 / 66 ~500 ~2 2,500 cases per day,Kingdom ~3,600 deaths per yearOFrance74 / 65 ~200 ~1.5 1000 cases per day,(decreasing) ~2,700 deaths per yearRPortugal 88 / 85 ~150 ~1 750 cases per day, ~1,800deaths per yearPIreland 76 / 74 ~300 ~0.75 1,500 cases per day,~1,400 deaths per yearDenmark 77 / 75 ~100 ~0.5 500 cases per day, ~900(decreasing) deaths per yearCanada 77 / 71 ~100 ~0.5 500 cases per day, ~900(increasing) deaths per year41chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVEGermany 67 / 64 ~100 ~0.5 500 cases per day, ~900deaths per yearSingapore 79 / 77 ~50 (increasing ~0.1 250 cases per day, ~180rapidly) deaths per yearDIceland 82 / 80 ~100 ~0(decreasing)ES26 In the past two to three months, as vaccination campaigns in other countrieshave peaked, governments have looked to relax domestic and borderArestrictions:E26.1 In some cases, subsequent growth in transmission has required agovernment response. Singapore, Iceland, France and Israel are allexamples of countries that have postponed plans forL border openness orre-escalated domestic restrictions.E26.2 Other countries have achieved a stable relaxation in domestic restrictions,but this approach has come with health coRnsequences, such as in the UKand Germany. In those countries, significant public health controlscontinue, relative to before COVID-19 (perhaps equivalent to current AlertLevel 2 or above in New Zealand) and case numbers and mortality areYvery significant, by New Zealand standards.L26.3 The return to the lowest level of restrictions in Denmark and now Norwayis still a relatively recent occurrence, and we will continue to monitorEwhether the epidemiological consequences there are sustainable.27 In looking at other couVntries, we learn that there is no easy solution and noperfect example. New Zealand’s unique starting position also affords usoptions for futureI strategy that are not available to other countries. We must tosome extent chTart our own path.Our approach foCr the next phase28 As we look to Reconnecting New Zealanders with the world, we are starting toAenter the next phase of our response. In the next phase with a shift to focuson vaccination, effective testing tracing and isolation, and controlling COVID-O19, we can aim to keep sickness and mortality at low levels without a heavyreliance on Alert Level 3 and 4 lockdowns, and with more stable, less intrusivepublic health controls, while being able to be more open at the border.R29Broadly speaking, there are three pieces to the puzzle of management ofPCOVID-19 in the next phase of our response:29.1 vaccination,29.2 the new framework, and29.3 border settings.51chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVE30 The pieces are interoperable, in that choosing different settings for one willaffect the need for the others. As we move into the next phase of ourresponse, including reconnection with the world, the settings for thesedifferent pieces will change.D31 Vaccination is the most important element, in that increases will create moreoptions for both domestic measures and border settings. We have had tight Eborders and enjoyed near normal conditions at home for much of theresponse. Higher rates of vaccination give us a greater set of options for theSother aspects of COVID-19 management. The priority order is thereforeachieving and maintaining the highest possible level of vaccination, thenAimplementing the new framework, followed by an changes to border settings.EObjectives32 The objectives of the new framework will be guided by a set of principles. At aLhigh level our objective is to:E32.1 Vaccinate – including good coverage across geographic areas, agerange, and ethnicity to prevent outbreaks,R32.2 Test, trace and isolate cases and contacts when they do arise,32.3 Control the impact of potential casYes through sustainable public healthmeasures,L32.4 Give as much certainty and stability as possible for people, andbusinesses, by removing the need for Alert Level 3 and 4 lockdowns,E32.5 Catch cases at the border, but work towards removing the bottlenecks,and being more opVen,32.6 Ensuring our hospitals and public health system are well equipped to careIfor cases ifT and when they do arise, and32.7 Maintain equity in health and economic outcomes.CVaccinationsA33 The new framework will depend for its viability on the highest possible level ofvaccination. Higher vaccination rates give us more choices for reconnection atOtheborder and reduce the strictness of the required ongoing public healthcontrols. High vaccination means that contact tracing and testing systems canR manage much of the work required to reduce transmission, and we expect tobe able to retire stronger domestic measures, like lockdowns.P34 Recent published research and modelling from Te Pūnaha Matatini (TPM)and the Institute of Environmental Science and Research (ESR), and theexperiences of other countries, tell us that:34.1 Every additional vaccination reduces transmission, sickness and deaths,but there are significantly greater benefits at much higher rates ofvaccination.61chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVE34.2 With higher vaccination, new cases in the community would be less likelyto create outbreaks and new outbreaks that do arise will be smaller andeasier to eliminate.34.2.1 With 90% coverage of the eligible (12+) population the rate of Dspread could be about 30% lower than at 70% coverage.E34.2.2 At 70% eligible population coverage, greater than one in threeoutbreaks would grow to more than 1,000 cases withoutdomestic restrictions. At 90% this would be around one in teSnoutbreaks.A34.2.3 Extending eligibility to the 5+ age group and achieving 90%coverage could reduce this to around one in 50 outbreaks orEfewer growing to more than 1,000 cases without domesticrestrictions.L34.3 Highly effective contact tracing, testing (including whole genomeEsequencing capabilities), and isolation protocols can also significantlyreduce transmission. For these to be most effective, it will be important tokeep case numbers low, at least initially. TRhis gives us the best chance ofrealising better outcomes over the medium term: fewer cases, less strainon the health system, and lower relia nce on more stringent domesticrestrictions. Y34.4 The dual wins of reducing transmission and reducing severe diseaseLcreate opportunities for fewer domestic restrictions, and for pathways forinternational travellers wEithout 14-day MIQ stays.35 Further preliminary modelling results presented in the table below indicateVthat a strong test-trace-isolate-quarantine (TTIQ) system and moderate publichealth measures may be enough to keep the virus suppressed, greatlyIreducing the need for strong public health measures, such as stay-at-homeTorders and workplace closures2. Results suggest that it would be valuable todevelop a suite of moderate public health interventions that can be sustainedCfor a long period of time if required.36 CurrAently, only those aged 12 and over are eligible for vaccination. However,children still play a role in transmission, so if a future decision enables us toOvaccinate younger age groups, this will improve the transmission reductionattributable to the vaccination campaign as shown in the final two rows of thetable.RVaccination Baseline public health Testing, tracing Estimated effectiveP coverage measures and isolation reproductionperformance number85% of overBaseline mitigations are in Full 1.1612splace that provide a 17%2 These estimates are based on current central estimates for vaccine effectiveness against infectionand onward transmission, with an assumed R0 = 6.71chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVE95% of over total reduction inLimited 1.1512s transmission.95% of over May include measures suchFull 1.0312s as mask use, ventilation,Ddensity restrictions indoor90% of over 5s Limited 1.00venues, support for people to85% of over 5s isolate. Full 0.99 E37 It is important to recognise that these key points relate to population Saverages. Rates of vaccination and transmission will vary betweencommunities. Future strategy must be made with fine-grained underAstandingabout where and with whom the greatest vulnerabilities and risks lie. Evenwith 80% or 90% vaccination coverage for the overall populatiEon, there will becommunities that have 70% or lower coverage or who cannot be vaccinatedand are therefore at risk of worse outcomes.L38 We are optimistic that we will achieve a very high level of vaccinationEdomestically. But, if vaccination rates do turn out lower, we would need tostrengthen the public health controls in the new framework and live with thoseRrestrictions in the longer-term. These unwelcome restrictions would benecessary to avoid overwhelming our hospitals with COVID-19 cases andaccepting mortality rates that surpass those of influenza and pneumonia.Y39 It is possible that higher levels of vaccination will identify unknown behaviourLimpacts and may make testing, case finding and isolation more difficult, asthere is greater incidence of asymptomatic infection that could still lead toEspread. People could be less incentivised to come forward for testing orcomply with tracing when they have been vaccinated, but there has not beenVsubstantive evidence of this effect from overseas. There will therefore be agreater need for broad based surveillance testing across workplaces andIwastewater testing.T40 The increasing availability of rapid, cheap and sufficiently accurateCsurveillance testing options will enable us to improve our surveillance testingapproach, while retaining the more involved and time consuming, but moreAaccurate, testing approaches for diagnostic confirmation of cases. Thisapproach is possible when we know that COVID-19 is in the community andOare trying to understand the level of spread, rather than for seeking outindividual cases.RThenew framework41 The major benefit of increasing our vaccination levels is the ability to changePour domestic response settings. However, even at very high levels,vaccination alone will not be enough to stop the spread. Even with effectivetesting, tracing and isolation we will need some enduring public healthcontrols, though much less stringent than before vaccination, coupled with thePublic Health Response measures.42 The new framework attached in Appendix 1 will provide for public healthcontrols for a high vaccination context. We will retain the features of the Alert81chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVELevel framework that have served us well, while adapting it for the next phaseof the response. The approach is being built from the best-available publichealth advice, science and modelling. Importantly, at all levels of the newframework, businesses and schools remain open, and people are not requiredto stay home. D43 The new framework features three levels, with: E43.1 Green (Prepare) a baseline level similar to pre-pandemic normal life butSwith widespread surveillance testing that could be in place when there areisolated or sporadic spread of cases in the community,A43.2 Amber (Control) an increased set of measures that we would rely on tocontrol spread when there are active clusters in the commEunity, and43.3 Red (Reduce), pitched at about Level 2.5 of our present framework, toLmore actively reduce transmission when there are multiple active clustersand/or action is needed to protect the health system.E44 With high vaccination we expect to be able to operate without stringentRcontrols like lockdowns. That said, we may need to resort to them in responseto extreme circumstances, such as for new variants that escape vaccineimmunity, or a sudden and unmanageab le rise in hospitalisation.Y45 The success of public health controls is reliant on public acceptance andcompliance. We know from expeLrience with the Alert Level controls that thesework best when they are as simple as possible to understand, coherent,evidence-based, and fair, wEith a clear legal backing. With the new framework,we need to ensure that people understand the value of stability. Practically,this could mean givingV up some of our every-day freedoms in exchange fornot having to return to a lockdown.I46 How we use thTe new framework is as important as its content. We will need tobe adaptive for different border arrangements, local situations, and localvaccinatioCn rates. The speed and frequency with how we use the higher levelsof the new framework will determine the impacts, length of time at higherleveAls, and potentially how high up the levels we shift.47 The measures can be deployed in a localised response. There will be differingOneedfor changes in levels depending on local spread dynamics, vaccinationrates, and health system capacity. However, relying on higher rates ofR vaccination while there is COVID-19 in the community will mean that webecome less anxious about the spread of single cases between regions,P reducing the need for more stringent borders between regions. We couldexpect that restrictions on inter-regional travel would only be required at theRed level setting.COVID-19 vaccination certificates48 Proof of vaccination requirements in some domestic settings would enable usto maximise the benefits of greater vaccination rates and allow greater91chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVEfreedoms and increased economic activity. I propose that we use COVID-19Vaccination Certificates (CVC) as part of the framework.49 The use of vaccination as a condition of entry to certain venues and eventscan reduce the likelihood of outbreaks and potential super-spreader events. DCVCs have also been used internationally to help encourage vaccinations, byacting as an incentive as part of a move towards fewer domestic controls. E50 Officials are exploring a range of domestic settings where CVCs may be used,Staking into account the risk of transmission at specific events, due to thenumber of people in attendance and the types of activities being performed.AThey are also looking at related issues such as equity, feasibility,employment, access to lifeline services, human rights, privacy and TreatyEconsiderations.51 Preparations are underway in the Ministry of Health for aL two-stage delivery ofa domestic vaccination certificate. Stage one will provide a paper-basedcertificate with a working title of the “Summer Pass”E that can also be stored onmobile phones. Due to privacy concerns this is a separate solution than thedigital vaccination certificate for international trRavel and will show a simpleview of compliance vaccination (or exemption) status with no clinical or privateinformation. Work on the Summer Pass as a tool for proving vaccinationstatus is scheduled to be completed inY early November.52 Preliminary consultation has begLun with representatives from the businessand community sectors on the possible introduction of a CVC in New Zealand.Feedback from targeted engEagement has mostly been positive but hashighlighted that these requirements will have a disproportionate impact oncommunities with loweVr vaccination rates, particularly younger Māori andPacific people. A CVC will also impact businesses who have to enforce therules, and they mIay have unvaccinated staff. Hospitality leaders, for example,have suggesteTd up to 30% of hospitality staff may be unvaccinated.53 s9(2)(h) CAOBorder settings54 The other benefit of vaccines is the opportunity to move forward with ourRapproach to reconnecting New Zealanders with the world. As with our newframework settings, vaccination does not provide a silver bullet. We will needP to take steps to reduce the risks of people coming into the country withCOVID-19.55 Border settings should be the last of the levers to move. We need to beprepared for the risk associated with changes at the border by getting ourvaccination levels high and having our new framework ready. In keeping withthe high level goals I have outlined, our border response needs to beconsistent, predictable, and fair. To ensure people have confidence in our101chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVEapproach, I am committed to a careful and progressive opening up thatminimises the risk of backward steps.56 Changes at the border are one of the wins we earn from higher vaccinationlevels. If we are prepared to control COVID-19 within the border, managed by Dhigh vaccination levels and our new framework, then we can change our risktolerance at the border. While our aim is still to catch cases at the border, Ethere is scope to adjust our settings so that not everyone is using 14-day MIQ.S57 We are investigating self-isolation and short stay MIQ, through the self-isolation pilot and changes to the testing regime in MIQ. We are also buildingAour vaccine certification technology, and the Traveller Health Declarationsystem. Longer term, we will be able to control COVID-19 with effectiveEvaccination programmes and treatments, which would allow vaccinatedarrivals to travel quarantine-free without risking significant health impacts forLNew Zealand.E58 At Cabinet on 1 November, I will be reporting back on our strategy forReconnecting New Zealanders with the world. In this paper I will give greaterdetail on the options for change at the border aRnd how we will move forwardwith the approach.Public health measures Y59 There is a significant amount of work and investment in other areas that willLsupport our shifting to a new approach. This work is being considered as partof the Reconnecting New Zealanders programme, to ensure readiness of theEtesting, tracing and isolation system, the MIQ system and the health systemcapacity being prepared to deal with potential increased health impacts.V60 An effective test, trace and isolate system is key to our ability to reducetransmission withIout requiring stronger population-level health measures. WeTmust ensure that our surveillance testing approach includes the latestadvances in testing capability, contact tracing capacity is sufficient, and thatCwe have an isolation and quarantine system that is fit for both incomingarrivals and domestic cases.A61 I foresee a future where we are not stretching the capacity of our hospitalsOand ICU beds, but we are ensuring we are prepared for an inevitable rise inhospitalisation of people who remain unvaccinated, and in some cases,vaccinated people who become severely ill. Officials are working on theRapproach to investing in the health system for the shift to the new approach,and how investment could change the thresholds for response in our newP framework.Other elements62 In order to leverage the individual protections offered by vaccination as part ofour new framework, there is infrastructure required in support. People willneed to be able to provide proof of their vaccination status, s9(2)(g)(i)111chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVE63 Officials will seek advice on the legal framework and orders in the COVID-19Public Health Response Act, to ensure that our approach is grounded in fit-for-purpose legislation. This includes investigation of the legal rights foremployers, hospitality and events.D64 We also need to take a deliberate, consistent, well-considered approach tothe question of individual rights versus group rights. s9(2)(g)(i) ES65 The new framework will have flow-on impacts into systems that are based onAthe current Alert Level framework such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme, andthe Resurgence Support Payment. Treasury is working with other agencies toEensure the wider economic support framework supports compliance withhealth measures and business transition.L66 Another flow-on impact of changing the Alert Level framework would beEsubstantial changes to operational guidance provided to agencies andbusinesses. Agencies will need to update advice for business and people onwhat activities and operations are possible at dRifferent levels of theframework. In reality, there will be iterations as we learn how rules impactbusinesses, and they adapt to new ways of operating.Y67 In my report back to Cabinet I will propose a process to allow business andother groups to bring substantiveL gaps or areas of operational uncertainty toofficials attention to make fixes quickly.ENext stepsV68 Officials will continue to develop the new framework and approach over thecoming weeks. I propose to return to Cabinet on 26 October with a finalframework for deIcisions.T69 The next paper will include:C69.1 the finalised framework design, and advice about transitioning betweenAlevels, including policy advice and advice from Public Health and from theStrategic COVID-19 Public Health Advisory Group (SC19PHAG),O69.2final decisions for the situations the COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates willbe used in and the detailed requirements, incorporating the furtherR engagement that is underway,69.3 an approach to the treatment of children, and others who cannot bePvaccinated, in the framework,69.4 the development of detailed operational planning and engagement for thetransition to, and implementation of, the new framework,69.5 advice on the implications for economic supports tied to the Alert Levelframework.121chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVE70 The SC19PHAG have been commissioned to provide feedback on the trafficlight framework and answer the following questions:70.1 What public health objectives or strategy should NZ pursue, following thecompletion of the vaccination campaign? D70.2 Given the answer to 1, what should future case-based measures be?E70.3 How do we transition to the new approach described above, noting thepossibility of a concurrent community outbreak? STransition planningA71 Last week, when we first discussed this paper, our central scenario was thatwe would return to zero active cases in Auckland and move inEto the lowestlevel of the Traffic Light, Green, nationwide once we were nearer tocompletion of the vaccination programme. L72 After more than six weeks with significant restrictionEs the public healthassessment is that zero cases is unlikely to be achieved with this outbreak.We are seeing too many unlinked cases in thisR outbreak, and a small numberof hospitalisations that suggest that there is some community transmission inAuckland that is not being detected by our contact tracing system.Y73 Partly, this undetected spread is because of the greater infectiousness of theDelta variant. It also reflects the fact that the outbreak was already large at theLtime we initially discovered it. And partly it is because of the characteristics ofthe communities into which the virus has now been spread. Though we haveEchanged our contact tracing processes and systems, the interlinkeddisadvantage and disengagement of some parts of these communities make itVvery challenging to trace and isolate all cases.I74 We will now need to transition to the Traffic Light framework while casesTcontinue to emerge and while vaccination continues to build. I expect thatAuckland will move into the Red level of the framework in November.CDecisions on what would be the first step in that transition are being soughttoday in the Alert Level paper that is also at this Cabinet meeting.A75 There is a range of controls that will need to be adjusted over time. We do notOhave a higher level than Red on the framework, and so we will need tomanage carefully the transition from Level 3 lockdown to the newarrangements to ensure that we do not need to return to widespreadRlockdowns. I envisage that the last measure we will remove is the boundarycontrol.P76 Vaccinations will already be helping us reduce transmission, and we will beincreasing relying on vaccination to limit spread of the virus as rates continueto grow. Modelling suggests that the risk of transmission will be meaningfullyreduced at 80% coverage for the eligible population and will be furtherreduced if we can achieve coverage as high as 90%. Benefits will be greaterstill if eligibility for vaccination is ultimately extended to younger age groups.131chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVERisks77 There are risks to our plan if the Red measures are not sufficiently strict tomaintain containment, or if the outbreak were to grow significantly whilevaccination rates continue to build. We will move cautiously and continue to Dobserve our situation closely and learn from the first steps we take and fromthose examples of countries that have begun this transition before us. E78 As noted above, we must also remain cognisant that rates of vaccination andStransmission will vary between communities. Even with a high averagevaccination level for the overall population, there will be communities at risk ofAworse outcomes due to lower community vaccination rates. Risks associatedwith population impacts and communication challenges are set out below.EModellingL79 By the end of October, more detailed modelling work will be undertaken whichwill explore, in priority order: E79.1 the precise nature of restrictions that would be necessary to result in theReffective rate of transmission being as close to, or below 1, in differentvaccination scenarios;Y79.2 the distribution of outcomes, beneath the national level, critical to ourunderstanding of the risks facing different communities of our strategicLchoices;79.3 the relationship betweenE prevalence, domestic restrictions, and theperformance of test, trace, isolate and quarantine levers (crucial tounderstanding undVer what conditions our ongoing response can be stableand sustainable);I79.4 the dynamics of COVID-19 management in different scenarios, includingTthe basis on which “Red” restrictions would be necessary and theexpected length of time under the different levels of the new framework.C80 These modelling results will enable agencies to provide advice on the socialandA economic impacts associated with the different scenarios explored. Thiscould include cost-benefit analysis of the trade-offs between the baseline levelOof domestic restrictions, the extent to which the border is open, and thelikelihood of needing to escalate our domestic response.RFinancialImplications81 Any funding implications will be considered as part of the follow-up paper atPthe end of October.Legislative Implications82 There are no direct legislative impacts in this paper. Changes will be madethrough the introduction of an order under the existing legislation. Changes tothe order would be made through the same process as current orders.141chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVE83 Officials are considering whether minor amendments to the COVID-19 PublicHealth Response Act 2020 (Act) could provide a firmer statutory basis for thenew framework, including in respect of enforcement powers. Theseamendments could be made through the amendment Bill currently before theHouse. DImpact Analysis E84 There are no legislative implications, therefore a regulatory impact statementis not required. SHuman Rights A85 s9(2)(h)ELE86 s9(2)(h)RYLEV87 s9(2)(h)ITCAORPopulation impacts88 Broadly there are two main population impacts from changes to the strategyP for managing COVID-19:88.1 Health impacts, if changes mean more spread of COVID-19 in thecommunity – even if tightly managed, and88.2 Impacts from the measures used to supress cases.89 We know that the virus has had a disproportionate health impact on Māori andPacific communities. Pacific people have made up over 60% of the cases in151chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVEthe main outbreaks, and Māori have the highest mortality rate. We need toensure that the next phase of our approach does not exacerbate theseinequities.90 Māori and Pacific people have higher rates of co-morbidities for the virus and Dhave more risk due to proximity to the border, employment in essential workerroles (not safely isolating at home), compromised resilience due to economic Ehardships, potentially greater impact of missing out on education due to digitaldivide, and barriers to accessing healthcare when they have higher rates ofSlong term conditions.A91 The principal impact from the change to the new framework is the introductionof measures that depend on the vaccination status of an individual. This couldEexacerbate existing inequities in the coverage of vaccination among differentgroups. Māori, and younger age groups of Pacific peoples currently have lowLrates of vaccination compared with the wider population and could bedisproportionately impacted by the new framework. There could also beEimpacts on disabled people who have had barriers to their access forvaccination. However, the use of vaccine requirements in some places couldRhave the effect of increasing vaccination rates as people have furtherincentive to be vaccinated.92 Early consultation with our Treaty partYners and Pacific people will beimportant to ensure the framework takes this into consideration in terms of itsuse and the timing of transition, aLnd we will continue our work on improvingthe vaccine roll-out for Māori. Feedback from the targeted engagement withthe Iwi Chairs Forum his weEek focussed on the importance of vaccination forMāori. The Iwi chairs were keen to ensure that changes to the frameworkwouldn’t disproportionaVtely affect Māori and were clear that the key to that islifting vaccination rates for Māori.I93 Additionally, thTere is lower coverage of vaccination in younger age groups,due to the timing of the roll out. These groups could be disproportionatelyimpacted Cif there is an early transition to the new framework due to the currentoutbreak in Auckland. In younger groups aged below 12 that cannot bevaccAinated yet there is higher risk of impact, and this age group is generallyexempt from mask usage. This could mean larger health impacts, and/ormore disruptive measures such as closing schools and isolating.OConsultationR94This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group in the Department of thePrime Minister and Cabinet. The Ministry of Health was consulted on thePpaper and Crown Law provided draft advice.95 We have short timeframes to be ready for the new approach, and it is criticallyimportant that the public is part of the journey. Relevant Ministers have ledengagement with targeted discussions with:95.1 our Treaty partners,95.2 the health sector,161chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVE95.3 supermarkets and retail,95.4 hospitality and events,95.5 places of worship,D95.6 schools and tertiary education institutions, andE95.7 workplaces.96 Feedback from these sectors has been incorporated into this paper. On tShewhole feedback was positive about the intent of the new framework. Thoseconsulted agreed that a new strategy that incorporated the high vacAcinationrate and aimed to minimise lockdowns was needed. The main concerns werearound being clear about how the framework would be used, wEhat mighttrigger changes in level, and in what circumstances lockdowns could still beused. There were also concerns about disproportionate iLmpacts of morecases of COVID-19 in the community and the vaccination requirements in theframework. E97 We have also received feedback from sectors on more detailed elements ofRthe new framework. Officials will incorporate this and continue to engage asthe final framework is being developed for 26 October. A table including thekey themes from feedback is attached in Appendix 3.YCommunicationsL98 Insights from our September sentiment research indicate New Zealanders stillstrongly support the GovernEment response to Covid-19 and information isconsistently meeting needs. People still believe that lockdown and the AlertLevel settings are our Vbest response right now, however they are lookingahead for guidance on when things will open up and return to ‘normal’.Despite being moIst restricted under the current settings, support in Aucklandis similar and tThey remain generally compliant.99 There is wCidespread understanding that, even when majority are vaccinated,there will be a difference in life compared to pre COVID-19. However, fatigueis setting in at the current Covid-19 in situation and concerns about the long-Aterm impacts of COVID-19 on mental health, access to schooling, and generallife progress are growing. There is also a growing pressure for opening theObordersand a greater expectation to know what the plan is for returning to amore ‘normal’ world.R100The planned shift to the traffic light system is likely to take place when thereare cases emerging in some of our more vulnerable communities. It is alsoPplanned to be introduced through a series of iterative changes to the currentsettings. This context poses significant communications challenges.101 We need to support New Zealanders to understand how progressivelychanging conditions for life in New Zealand (eg vaccination) enable them tolive their lives as safely as possible under a new framework. We need toconsider how to move away from a focus on daily case numbers to keep171chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:46:00SENSITIVEpeople focused on actionable steps they can take, and a shared responsibilityfor action.102 To achieve the above an announcement is being planned for 14 October. Thiswill be followed by a system wide refresh of all websites, collateral and Dmessaging/guidance across all agencies and sectors. Across allcommunications, we will highlight vaccination as central to our future strategy Ethat many of the freedoms we seek are dependent on high rates ofvaccination.SProactive ReleaseA103 I intend to proactively release this Cabinet paper following Cabinetconsideration.

There were 60 new casesiidentified in the community in the 24 hours to 9am Sunday 10 October, of whicht56 were in Auckland, 3 in the Waikato and 1 in the Bay of Plenty.c6 The Acting Director-General of Health’s interim advice notes that infectionsaseem to be following a course consistent with a Reproduction Rate of 1.2(meaning a 20 percent increase in cases every four days). Significant numbersoofthe new cases have not been identified as contacts previously, meaning theywere not self-isolating prior to testing positive. This raises the potential forrundetected transmission to occur.P7Although growth in cases in the Auckland clusters is not exponential, casecounts are continuing to grow. There has been a transition from complexhouseholds being the main focus for concern to the risk posed by growth invarious forms of residential housing such as transitional and emergencyhousing.8 The issues in managing the Waikato subcluster include contact tracing beinghampered by some cases who have declined to reveal their personalmovements. Consequently, known public locations of interest have beenlimited so far and there is the potential for undetected transmission to be19xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVEoccurring. A potential exposure event involving around 50 people is related tothis subcluster.9 The public health risk assessment on Thursday 7 October notes that the risk ofcommunity transmission remains medium for both the Auckland and Waikatoregions. The outbreak is contained outside of these regions and there is a low drisk of community transmission for the rest of New Zealand.e10 Vaccination rates are increasing overall. There are still inequities in coverageby age group and ethnicity. The drive to increase vaccination rates in Aucklandsshould continue, particularly in the 12-19, 20-34 and 35-49 age groups, and forMāori and Pacific peoples.a11 There are concerns about the social impact of enduring Alert Level restrictions,particularly on at risk populations. There continues to bee strong demand formental health support services, with a 14 percent increase in the number ofincidents reported by Youthline Helpline over thel past week. Fatigue andconfusion about continued adjustments to Alert Leevel settings emphasise theneed for us to provide New Zealanders with as much clarity as possible aboutwhat to expect over the coming month. R12 On the basis of the latest public health risk assessment and the Acting Director-General of Health’s interim advice, I propose Cabinet agrees to:y12.1 keep Auckland at the current Alert Level 3 from 11.59pm Tuesday 12October (the first stage of the three-stage reduction);le12.2 keep the rest of New Zealand outside the Alert Level 3 areas at AlertLevel 2 from 11.59pm Tuesday 12 October.v13 The Director-General will provide an oral update to Cabinet today on theisituation and appropriate Alert Level in Waikato and Northland. I propose thetcountry’s Alert Level settings are next reviewed by Cabinet on Monday 18cOctober.a14 Last week, Cabinet noted advice from officials that Auckland educationalfacilities should reopen to all students from Monday 18 October, pending publicohealth advice and appropriate public health controls. The public health adviceconcerning education settings is due on Thursday 14 October. Given the needrfor schools to prepare to operationalise amended settings I do not expectschools to reopen until Tuesday 26 October. I recommend that CabinetPconfirms these arrangements on Monday 18 October (subject to the latestpublic health advice).15 Ahead of this we need to provide more clarity to the Auckland education sectorabout what public health controls will be required to enable reopening ofschools and early learning services for all pupils in the Auckland region. Theseinclude requiring face coverings for teachers and for students from year 9 andabove and the collection of information about pupils’ vaccination status.29xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVE16 The Minister for Education is today seeking Cabinet agreement to vaccinationand testing requirements to enable Auckland education entities to reopen.17 Given the public health risk assessment and advice from the Acting Director-General, I do not consider it appropriate to make further amendments to theAlert Level 2/3 boundary permissions. Further advice on options to enable dadditional building and construction movement across the boundary will beprovided on Monday 18 October. Despite the step down in Alert Level e3 inAuckland the key tenets of Alert Level 3 remain, including limiting movement.sSituation report18 Parts of the Waikato and Northland are at Alert Level 3, Auackland is at areduced Alert Level 3 (the first stage of the three-stage reduction) and the restof the country is at Alert Level 2. As at 9am Sunday 10 October 2021, thereehave been 1,587 confirmed community cases detected since 17 August, ofwhich 1,538 are in Auckland, 31 are in Waikato, 1 is in the Bay of Plenty andl17 are in Wellington. There were 60 new cases in the 24 hours to 9am Sundaye10 October, 56 in Auckland, 3 in Waikato and 1 in the Bay of Plenty.R19 The public health risk assessment conducted on 7 October notes that the riskof community transmission remains medium for both the Auckland and Waikatoregions. The outbreak is contained outside of these regions and there is a lowrisk of community transmission for the rest of New Zealand.yUpdated modelling in relation to the current outbreaklSimulating case trajectories e20 Several different methods for estimating the effective reproduction number(R ) indicate that ovver the previous two weeks it is very likely to have beeneffabove 1. At the current low case numbers, the uncertainty around the true valuefor R is high, ibut central estimates are typically between 1.2 and 1.3. Subtleefftdifferences in Reff between the values of 1.1 and 1.5 can lead to vastly differentoutcomesc: at 1.1, new daily case numbers may take around a month to doublein size, while at 1.5 this would take around a week.a21 Modelling which considers scenarios for Alert Level 3, featuring differentoeffectiveness for reducing transmission, remains instructive in consideringpotential caseloads going forward.r21.1Medium transmission scenario: Under a scenario for transmissionPconsistent with the central estimate for R , cases would be expected toeffcontinue to increase in the coming weeks. There is a wide range ofsimulated outcomes around the median, skewed to the downside ofgreater infection and hospitalisation. Very few simulations in thisscenario feature declining case numbers in the near-term.21.2 Lower transmission scenario: Under more optimistic transmissionassumptions, case numbers may steadily decline in the nearer-term,reducing to single-digit daily case numbers by November, on average.39xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVE21.3 Higher transmission scenario: Scenarios based on a slightly higher Reff(between 1.5 and 1.8) lead to significantly worse outcomes in themedium-term. Daily case numbers might rise in line with observationsfrom other low-COVID jurisdictions (such Australian states or Singapore)without enhanced restrictions being reintroduced in areas withtransmission. d22 By way of international comparison, the Reff in Victoria has been estimateed atbetween 1.3 and 1.6 over the past several weeks. At the beginning ofSeptember, the 5-day average for new daily cases was around 80. Five weeksslater, Victoria is experiencing around 1,500 cases per day.a23 In the longer-run, the impacts of increased vaccination rates on reducingtransmission are seen from around early December in the medium or loweretransmission scenarios. Given that transmission will continue as the curvebends, modelling would support an intention to keep case numbers as low aspossible until as many individuals as possible have lthe opportunity to becomeefully vaccinated.Impacts of uneven vaccination coverage R24 Preliminary modelling has been undertaken which simulates the ongoingoutbreak based on vaccination rat es and demographics specific to SouthAuckland. The community featuryes a younger age structure, lower rates ofvaccination and is likely to be at greater risk of hospitalisation.l25 The near-term behavioure of these results looks very similar to the genericmodelling discussed above. However, the results suggest that over themedium-term, the case curve may not bend in the same way. Instead, casevnumbers, under a continuing Alert Level 3, may continue to grow through to theend of this year, leading to greater burdens of hospitalisations and deaths.itNext steps and conclusions from modelling resultsc26 Outbreak modelling will begin to explore downside scenarios under whichahospital capacity may be reached. Under certain assumptions about futuretransmission (R significantly greater than 1) these scenarios will invariablyeffoshowhospital capacity being exceeded. However, this modelling will informdecision-making on when this is judged to be a significant risk in order thatrresponse decisions can be made in good time to avert the risks ofP hospitalisations exceeding capacity. Initial thinking is that a decision to increaserestrictions would be required two to three weeks in advance of a projectedpeak in concurrent hospitalisations.27 As previously advised, with the low number of daily new cases, stochastic(random/chance) events will dominate outcomes in both models and the realworld. This is true for a hypothetical shift down to Alert Level 2 as it was for theprevious decision to move Auckland to Alert Level 3. An individual case’scircumstances (e.g. size of household, number of other close contacts,workplace presence, distancing behaviour) make a big difference to thetransmission risks associated with the case.49xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVE28 Therefore, officials continue to advise that the modelled scenarios should beconsidered in conjunction with case-specific information. Emergent case-specific information should be used as an early indicator of whether R is likelyeffto trend to the upper or lower end of the estimated range. Poorer simulatedoutcomes are more likely to eventuate where:d28.1 there remains a significant number of undetected cases in thecommunity; e28.2 new cases have periods where they are likely to be infectious in thescommunity; anda28.3 new cases are infectious in the community – more likely in higher-risksettings where there are numerous, hard to trace, contacts.eActing Director-General of Health’s interim assessment against the healthfactors leLikelihood that Auckland outbreak is contained29 The Auckland outbreak is not contained. This is because there are currentlyRactive clusters or outbreaks in other regions of New Zealand (Waikato).30 The number of new daily cases reported in the Auckland region indicates thatcase numbers are gradually increasing, but the growth rate is not yetyexponential. There is a relatively high prevalence of cases reported in SouthAuckland, although there has been a dispersion of cases across Auckland overlthe past 14 days. Suburbs of interest include Clover Park, Favona, Māngere,eManurewa, Mount Wellington, Henderson, Papakura and Red Beach. TheSouth Auckland subclusters are not currently contained.v31 There is an emerging cluster within the Waikato region, with 22 cases linked toithis subcluster. The first Waikato case was reported on Sunday 3 October.tThere is potential for undetected community transmission to be occurring in thiscregion, and additional linked cases are probable because one of the positivecases likely contracted the virus at a party held on the weekend of 2-3 October,awhich was attended by approximately 50 other people, who were not all locals.The outbreak in Waikato region is currently not contained.o32 The single case previously identified in Palmerston North is considered low risk.rThis is due to there being few locations of interest and the rapid isolation of theindividual involved. Advice from the Mid Central DHB is that the case has beenPhighly cooperative and is complying with all necessary isolation and contacttracing requirements.33 A case that was under investigation after returning a weak positive result froma test in Whangarei earlier this week returned a positive test result in Aucklandon Thursday 7 October. It is possible the original test was taken in the earlystage of the individual’s infection, which would help limit any potential spreadof infection from the case.59xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVEUpdate on unlinked cases and sub-clusters of concern34 At present, infections seem to be following a course consistent with aReproduction Rate of 1.2 (meaning a 20 percent increase in cases every fourdays). Significant numbers of the new cases being detected have not previouslybeen identified as contacts, meaning they were not self-isolating prior to testingdpositive. This raises the potential for undetected transmission to occur.e35 There are 10 active subclusters within Auckland, an increase from five at thetime of the last risk assessment on 30 September. Although growth in cases isnot exponential, case counts are continuing to grow and there hass been atransition from complex households being the main focus for concern to the riskposed by growth amongst various forms of residential houasing includingtransitional and emergency housing.e36 The housing situation involves a number of transient accommodationarrangements across several suburbs of Auckland. There are 7 transitionallhousing facilities currently involved. Other accommodation arrangementseinclude rough sleeping, transient rentals (whereby the renter may then have anumber of other people residing in their room but without the landlordRnecessarily having details of these individuals), motels, and temporary andemergency housing. A rapid enhanced testing plan has been developed byARPHS for the 7 transitional housing facilities. There is an AOG, multi-agencyresponse involved along with Māori and Pacific providers and communityyleaders and also involving senior gang members where appropriate. ARPHShas been provided with social workers and MSD is closely involved.le37 The Waikato subcluster currently contains 22 active cases. All these cases aregenomically and epidemiologically linked and there is a very strong direct linkvto one of the Auckland sub-clusters. Cases are spread across Raglan, Kawhia,Lake Karapiro, and Hamilton. The exposure events (one involving around 50ipeople) associated with these cases have sometimes been related to peopletwho have declined to reveal their personal movements. Consequently, knowncpublic locations of interest have been limited so far and there is the potential forundetected transmission to be occurring.aTesting rateso38 There is confidence in the capability and capacity of the laboratory testingsystem. National surge capacity has increased and laboratories are prioritisingrprocessingsamples from people who are symptomatic, close contacts or whoP have been in locations of interest. There are no concerns with supply chain forreagents, consumables and swabs.39 Enhanced surveillance testing is underway in the Auckland region. Thisincludes specific testing efforts in South and West Auckland and in residentialhousing facilities. There were 13,331 tests in the metro Auckland area(excluding both MIF guest and MIF worker testing) on Tuesday 5 October.Following confirmed in-facility transmission event at Crowne Plaza Auckland(most likely source of current community outbreak), increased surveillancetesting of quarantine and isolation workers is being implemented.69xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVE40 The number of tests processed in the last seven days is 89,315 which is a 7-day moving average of 4,379 tests per day. There has been increased levels ofessential worker testing. Since Monday 20 September, 56,323 tests onessential workers have been conducted. On Wednesday 6 October 4,379essential workers were tested.d41 The Waikato DHB increased their testing capacity following the announcementof local positive cases. As of 7 October, 8 total community testing centrese(CTCs) were open: 1 permanent CTC and 7 pop-up CTCs. CTCs are alsosupported by primary care, with a number of GP practices in the area offeringsCOVID-19 swabbing to both enrolled and unenrolled patients.42 There are no unexpected wastewater surveillance testing resultas to report.Vaccination ratese43 Vaccination rates are increasing overall since the previous risk assessment onl30 September. Nationally, 80 percent of eligible people have received their firstedose of the vaccine and 51 percent have received both doses of the vaccine.44 There are still inequities in coverage by age group and ethnicity. VaccinationRrates for Māori and Pacific Peoples are still low for the 12 – 19, 20 -34 and 35-49 age groups, and particularly for second doses. Vaccination rates for suburbsof interest in Auckland are also incre asing, particularly among Pacific peoples.y45 The drive to increase vaccination rates in Auckland should continue, particularlyin the 12-19, 20-34 and 35-49 age groups, and for Māori and Pacific peoples.leHealth system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systems46 There are 23 current hospitalisations. These cases are in Middlemore Hospitalv(11 total, 4 in ICU/HDU), Auckland City Hospital (10), Starship Hospital (1), andWaikato Base Hospital (1). One death was recorded in the week commencingi4 October.tc47 The Ministry of Health's National PPE and Critical Medical Supply Chain hasgood stocks of PPE, with at least a month's reserves to meet high pandemicademand. Orders continue to be confirmed and shipments of more PPE receivedevery week. We are working with our government partners to minimise impactsooffreight delays.r48 There is good capacity in the quarantine system. Urgent work is being done toestablish a quarantine facility in Hamilton, should this be required. The MinistryPof Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) has put all other regions onnotice to identify potential quarantine facilities and plans to stand these up atshort notice should these be required. Work is also underway for a homequarantine option in the event that cases emerge in locations where there is noeasy access to MIQ facilities.49 As at 9am Thursday 7 October, there were 41,973 contacts identified in relationto the current outbreak recorded in the National Contact Tracing Solution. Ofthese 41,973 contacts, 1,796 are Household contacts (96% have beencontacted), 423 are Close Plus contacts (96% have been contacted), 35,19879xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVEare Close contacts (91% have been contacted) and 4,556 are Casual Pluscontacts (55% have been contacted).50 Case and contacts management has recently become more complex. This isbased on the communities that have been affected and the associated level ofsupport that is required to ensure that they understand the public health advice. dThis is putting significant strain on the current workforce undertaking this work.Additional support is being provided by public health units outside of Auckleand,the National Investigation and Tracing Centre surge capacity has beenactivated and preparation for reactivating additional call centres is underway.s51 As previously reported, the workforce in Auckland is stretched and fatigued.aWork has been shared across the country, recruitment is underway to findcritical resources and ARPHS are developing resourcing plans for the next twoemonths as this outbreak is expected to have a significant tail. If there wasanother significant incursion/outbreak in the next two months New Zealandwould struggle to respond like it has in this August olutbreak.e52 As at Thursday 7 October, there were 3.3 million registered users of the COVID-19 Tracer App (2,252 registrations that day).R There had been approximately 2.4million QR code scans that day, and 2.2 million people had activated Bluetooth.Acting Director-General of Health’s conclus ionsy53 In light of the above, the Acting Director-General recommends that from11.59pm Tuesday 12 October:le53.1 Auckland should remain in stage one of the modified Alert Level 3 (ratherthan moving to stage two at this time), with a further risk assessment tobe held on 14v October; and53.2 The resti of New Zealand (excluding the Waikato and Northland AlertLevel t3 areas) should remain at Alert Level 2, noting that any move toAlecrt Level 1 should not occur until Auckland is at Alert Level 2.54 Furthaer risk assessments will be held on:54.1 Monday 11 October, reviewing the situation and appropriate Alert Leveloin the Waikato and Northland areas; andr54.2 Thursday 14 October, reviewing the situation and appropriate AlertP Levels for Auckland and the rest of New Zealand.55 Regarding the proposed reopening of educational entities on Monday 18October, public health officials remain concerned about potential transmissionrisks association with reopening of these facilities if appropriate public healthmeasures are not in place. The Ministry of Health will provide advice on 14October on modelling to understand the potential impacts of reopening schools,and on appropriate public health controls to support reopening.89xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVEProposal regarding Alert Levels56 On the basis of the latest public health risk assessment and the Acting Director-General of Health’s interim advice, I propose Cabinet agrees to:56.1 keep Auckland at Alert Level 3 settings, with the current step-onedreduction in settings continuing to apply for a further week; and56.2 keep the rest of New Zealand outside the Alert Level 3 areas at eAlertLevel 2.s57 The Director-General will provide an oral update on the latest situation andappropriate Alert Level settings for the Waikato and Northland Alert Level 3aareas today.58 I propose these settings are reviewed by Cabinet on Moneday 18 October.59 I do not recommend making any further amendmenlts to loosen the Alert Level2/3 boundary permissions (to support future reopeening of Auckland educationentities or to enable building and construction of infrastructure that contributesto government priority projects) today. Health officials advise that any increasedRmovement across the boundary increases the risk of further spread to otherparts of New Zealand. Further advice on these amendments will provided toCabinet on 18 October.y60 Due to the spread of cases beyond the Auckland boundaries I will ask theDirector-General to provide a verbal update at this meeting on whether Cabinetlshould consider tighteninge boundary restrictions.What will be required to shift Auckland to stage two of the reduced Alert Level 3vsettingsi61 On Monday 4 October Cabinet agreed to a staged approach to reducing AlerttLevel 3 settings in Auckland, to enable greater activity while still managingcpublic health risk. We also agreed to the settings at each step, and to shiftAuckland to step one [CAB-21-MIN-0407 refers].a62 Communications and announcements about the three-staged reduction in AlertoLevel 3 settings in Auckland have emphasised that decisions to move downeach stage will be informed by public health risk assessments and only maderwhen it is safe to do so. Despite this, there will be a public expectation that therewill not be long delays between shifts.P63I do not propose shifting Auckland to the second stage of reduced Alert Level 3settings today but I have asked officials to consider criteria for further relaxingrestrictions in Auckland, given differing risk tolerances for case numbers,including any potential transition towards a traffic light framework.Reopening of Auckland schools and early learning services to all students64 On 4 October, Cabinet noted advice from officials that Auckland schools couldreopen to all year 1 to 13 students from Monday 18 October, subject to thelatest public health and appropriate public health controls being in place [CAB-99xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVE21-MIN-0407 refers]. From Wednesday 6 October, more children were able toreturn to early learning services, with children in bubbles of ten.65 Public health officials remain concerned that without appropriate public healthmeasures re-opening could accelerate the transmission of COVID-19 in theAuckland area. There are ongoing concerns about the potential transmission drisks associated with increased movements of students, parents and staff toand from schools, in addition to the risk of transmission at schools themseelves.The Ministry of Health is commissioning modelling from Te Pūnaha Matatini tobetter understand the potential impacts of reopening schools with thesappropriate public health measures to enable schools to reopen safely.a66 The public health advice concerning education settings is due on Thursday 14October. Given the need for schools to prepare to operationalise amendedesettings, I do not expect schools to reopen until Tuesday 26 October. Irecommend that Cabinet confirms these arrangements on 18 October, subjectto the latest public health advice. le67 I have requested further advice on whether a vaccination threshold should applybefore schools can reopen and the feasibRility of doing this at an individualschool community level. While we are not ready to confirm the decision aboutwhen schools and early learning services can reopen for all, I think it isimportant to provide the sector, par ents, caregivers, and children with clarityabout the public health controls ythat will be required when they are able toreturn.l68 When children and young epeople are able to return to school and early learningservices, physical distancing and bubble requirements will be removed but allother Alert level 3 revquirements will be retained. This will include a requirementfor all staff and year 9 to 13 students to wear face coverings indoors.i69 Additional putblic health controls have also been considered by officials, toreflect the current public health risk in Auckland and other Alert Level 3 areas.cThe Minister of Education is bringing a companion paper seeking agreement tovaccination and testing requirements for the education workforce. This includesaa requirement for schools to maintain an up to date register with the vaccinestatus for all eligible students and staff (fully, partially, exempt or no informationoprovided).Auckland schools will be expected to seek information from alleligible students and staff. This information will be sought once schools restart,randis expected to be collected within two weeks. This would enable publicP health controls to be varied by the level of vaccination in a school. For example,removing the requirement to wear face coverings when there is sufficient levelsof vaccination.70 Further to vaccine and testing requirements, other public health controls1 havebeen identified by officials to mitigate transmission risk in schools and earlylearning services, including:1 Some of these measures were included in the previous Cabinet paper.109xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVE70.1 face coverings will be required on school transport for people aged 12and over (school transport services are currently exempt from publictransport face covering requirements)70.2 time outdoors for students and staff will be maximised, includingbreaks, lunch, before and after school (unless the weather does not dallow), and rooms will be aired during breaks;e70.3 exercising and singing will take place outdoors;s70.4 groups meeting indoors, including assemblies or staff meetings, will beavoided;a70.5 exams will go ahead, but physical distancing will be maximised withinthe space available, with a minimum of 1.5m betweeen desks; and70.6 schools or early learning services near suburbs and clusters of concernlwill be closed if required. e71 The Ministry of Education notes a risk that schools may see a large cohort ofRstudents not attending onsite due to a fear of COVID-19 and other factorsassociated with remaining at Alert Level 3 keeping them home. Delivering amixed model of learning for students located both onsite and at home will bevery difficult to maintain. If this mixed model approach were taken for anyextended period, it could have serious implications for both student learningand staff wellbeing.le72 Opening up schools to all year levels will also require changes to thepermissions to travel across the Auckland Alert Level 3/2 boundary, includingvfor teachers and students who are currently outside of the Alert Level 3 areaand will need to cross the boundary to return to school either on a long-termi(students returning to school) or short-term (teachers travelling across thetboundary daily to work) basis. In line with the original policy intent to allowcstudents to return from school, I propose to permit travel across the Aucklandboundary so that students who board in hostels on the other side of theaboundary, and are currently at home for the holidays, may make one move tothe hostel and stay there until restrictions are withdrawn. Officials will provideofurtheradvice on proposals to amend the Alert Level 3/2 boundary permissionsto facilitate short term education related movement.r73From 18 October, children in years 1-10 will continue to be able to attend schoolPwhen their parents or caregivers have to go to work and there are no options tocare for them at home. Children will also be able to attend early learningservices based on the capacity of the service to accommodate bubbles of tenchildren and meet other public health controls.Assessment of the proposed measures/options against the non-health factors74 I have assessed the proposed measures against the non-health factors agreedby Cabinet, as set out below. It is positive that high-frequency economicindicators point to a continued rebound in Auckland’s activity since moving119xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVE79 When fully implemented, the Treasury estimates that these changes wouldreduce the economic impact of Alert Level 3 in Auckland from $210 million perweek (4% of national GDP) to approximately $40 million per week (1% ofnational GDP), a level similar to if ‘Delta’ Alert Level 2 was applied.Updated information about uptake of grants and benefits d80 The Wage Subsidy Scheme August 2021 has had strong uptake with $2,954emillion paid over four payments as at Tuesday 5 October, though uptake hasfallen with each subsequent fortnightly payment. Overall, the payments havessupported 1,255,272 jobs, of which the vast majority are for businesses withunder 500 employees. The August 2021 Resurgence Support PaymentaScheme has also had strong uptake with $906 million paid across the twopayments as of Wednesday 29 September. The vast majority of support (93%eof recipients) has been for businesses with fewer than 10 employees.81 The number of people on a main benefit increased lafter lockdown, peaking at10,401 higher in the week of Friday 17 Septembere. However, it has fallen since,with 8,613 more people now on main benefit than before lockdown. Food grantsincreased significantly in the first two weeks Rafter lockdown but have fallen eachweek since and as at Friday1 October are 10% lower than before lockdown.The Auckland region is now receiving 32% of all food grants, the same as theweek before lockdown, after peaking at 38% in early September.y82 The August 2021 Resurgence Support Payment Scheme has also had stronguptake with $943 million palid across the two payments as of Wednesday 6October. The vast majoritye of support (around 93% of recipients) has been forbusinesses with fewer than 10 FTEs.vImpacts on at risk populations83 The issues raisied in previous Alert Level reviews continue to persist despite thetgradual easing of Alert Level restrictions across most parts of the country.These incclude, but are not limited to ongoing restrictions on earning capacity;inequitable access to material essentials; issues related to education andlearnaing; strong and ongoing demand for mental health support services; andcontinued discrimination targeted towards Pacific peoples and disabled people.o84 Additional updates on population impacts from the past week include:r84.1ongoing restrictions and future uncertainties are negatively impactingPMāori whanau and business stress, resiliency and future planningcapabilities. It will be crucial to engage with Māori, and providereassurance about, strategies to safely return to school when Aucklandschools reopen.84.2 there continue to be concerns from ethnic communities around theimpact of prolonged restrictions on mental health and wellbeing. This hasbeen magnified by the uncertainty around when Alert Levels will de-escalate in both Auckland and the rest of New Zealand. Timely andbespoke communications will be important to ensure communities are139xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:06:22SENSITIVEaware of what is permissible at each Alert Level, particularly thegraduated Alert Level 3 settings for Auckland.84.3 progress is being made on increasing vaccination rates of Pacific people.This is being achieved through a range of tailored, Pacific community-led initiatives, such as ethnic-specific drive-through vaccination stations. d84.4 the level of harm and nature of the violence where incidents of family andesexual violence are occurring is high. Increased support is beingprovided for MIQ facilities, following reports of family harm incidents inssome of these facilities.a84.5 there was a 14 percent increase in the number of incidents reported byYouthline Helpline this week, with 117 incidents reported (compared to103 last week). Fifteen incidents required external eintervention.84.6 More frequent adjustments to Alert Level settlings is resulting in reducedclarity and certainty for older people. Theere is a risk that some olderpeople’s confidence to leave their homes will reduce as a result, leadingto increased loneliness and isolation, Rpossible delays in seeking medicaladvice, and reduced ability to participate in usual activities (such asvolunteering at community organisations). Older people are also seekingreassurance about the releva nt risks and impacts of becoming COVID-19 positive under the cuyrrent vaccination programme, and whetherbooster shots are necessary.l84.7 Disabled people coentinue to experience issues relating to face coveringexemptions. Work is continuing on communications and engagement toensure disabled people with exemptions are treated with respect. Workvto promote disabled people’s access to vaccinations is also ongoing.iPublic attitudes and compliancet85 A social mcedia scan following the Monday 4 October Alert Level announcementindicated mixed reactions. Some members of the public continue to voiceconcaern about Alert Level restrictions easing, with others believing restrictionshave been too enduring. Regarding the three-stage reduction in Auckland’soAlert Level 3 settings, feedback was that the plan was unclear and complicated,with many concerned about increased risk and potential to undermine efforts todate, and resulting in increased pressure on the health care system. Somercommentedthat they were frustrated by enduring restrictions and felt thePGovernment was continuing to move the goal posts.86 Between 11.59pm Tuesday 21 September and 5pm Wednesday 6 October,New Zealand Police have undertaken 8,471 pandemic-related events inAuckland and the Waikato Alert Level 3 area. A total of 2,589 online 105 breachnotifications were received from members of the public over the same period(2,538 in Alert Level 3 areas and 51 in Alert Level 2 areas).87 Since Wednesday 22 September, 591 pandemic-related infringement noticeshave been issued by Police, with non-compliance principally relating to stay-at-home orders and failure to maintain physical distancing requirements.

COVID-19 Vaccine Certificates (CVCs) have been identified as a tool to help support thebroader public health response to COVID-19 while vaccination rates are lower than optimal.CVCs are likely to be most effective in settings where there is greater risk of communitSytransmission, such as large and high-risk settings.A2. Public health advice is that mandating CVCs at very large, high-risk events would reducethe risk of super-spreader events and protect vulnerable persons present. There would alsoEbe a public health benefit in extending the use of CVCs to a wider range of venues in theevent of a community outbreak. Public health advice is that there is a benefit in people beingvaccinated at all high-risk settings, especially when other public healLth measures may beimpractical, such as settings where face covering cannot always be worn (i.e. when eatingand drinking, singing or exercising). We have indicated how theEse wider mandates might sitwithin Alert Levels at Attachment A.R3. Officials have undertaken consultation with sector representatives, business and communitygroups during the week of 4 October. A stakeholder engagement summary, including the listof stakeholders consulted with, is at Attachment B. Key messages from this engagementYinclude:a) Operators are wanting a clear framework with easy to understand rules and guidance asto which events and venues should or Lshouldn’t use CVCs.b) There is broad support across sectors for the use of CVCs if it is accompanied by cleardirectives on where CVCs will be Emandated to make it easier for operatorsc) The majority supported the exemption framework for individuals who could not bevaccinated because of healVth reasons and for children ineligible for vaccination.4. Having considered the public health advice and input from stakeholder consultation, officialsIconsider there are several options for mandating the use of CVCs, which can be closelyTcorrelated to the risks of COVID-19 in the community. These options are outlined in therecommendations above.C5. Vaccine requirements cannot be imposed on those who are ineligible to be vaccinated dueto medical Areasons or age (i.e. under 12). Officials propose that exemptions from vaccinerequirements in these settings be applied rather narrowly and recommend limitingexemptions to those on medical grounds and under 12 years and 3 months (to allowOsuitable time for 12 year olds to be vaccinated).s9(2)(h)6.RP7. To preserve the privacy of those with exemptions, the CVC will be constructed so that thosewho are fully vaccinated and those with legitimate medical exemptions will appear equallyauthorised to the verifier/venue staff. The CVC itself therefore will not be digital proof ofvaccination, as there will be no distinction between those vaccinated and those with anCOVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 7 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEexemption.8. In future, should a wider range of settings wish to use the CVC to prove vaccination, theywould be required to accept the same exemption categories as accepted for use of theCVC. This would mean that in some higher-risk settings a CVC may not be suitable as proofDof vaccination (i.e. border work), however it may be suitable in other lower-risk settings.E9. At present, vaccine requirements in certain settings may be mandated through secondarylegislation, however primary legislation would need to be updated to add an avoidance ofdoubt clause in the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020. Primary legislation isS alsorequired to prohibit the use of CVCs in certain settings, and to enable the use of CVCsthemselves as a mandatory form of evidence. Further detail on the legislative reqAuirementsand processes will be provided next week.EBackgroundL10. You previously received advice on the use of CVCs as public health measure to reduce therisk of spread of COVID-19 [DPMC-2021/22-324 refers]. Following this advice, you directedEofficials to develop further advice on using CVCs at high-risk events and venues, and awider set of lower-risk settings.R11. DPMC and Ministry of Health previously advised on the use of CVCs in high-risk settings[DPMC-2021/22-412]. You agreed to a series of parameters around the use of CVCs for thepurposes of consultation. Officials have now concluded this consultation and have revisedYthe proposed framework for categories in which CVCs should be used domestically. Thereare also proposed changes to the exemption categories and requirements for CVCs.L12. Previous advice indicated the public health benefits of CVCs, depend on the level ofvaccination coverage, whether an ouEtbreak is occurring, and the number of COVID-19cases. CVCs could mitigate the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in some settings and protectvulnerable populations by reducVing the risk of COVID-19 spread.Consultation and stakeholder engagementIT13. You directed officials to consult on a draft framework of where CVCs would be required,optional and prohCibited and an exemption framework. DPMC and government departmentsengaged with a range of representatives and received a substantial level of feedback. Wehave summarised the key messages below and greater detail is provided in Attachment B.AEngagement with Māori as the Treaty PartnerO14. Through targeted engagement at the National Iwi Chairs Forum, DPMC Community Paneland Māori-event organisers such as Te Matatini and Waka Ama NZ, the main feedbackRreceived was that communication on the use of CVCs should be provided by Māori, andmarae leaders should have the authority to make their own decisions on using CVCs. Clearcommunication is needed to continue to support vaccine rollout. The CVC itself should alsoPbe accessible, considering digital equity concerns and Māori health providers. Engagementhas not included marae leaders and regional Māori representatives at this stage.Community representatives15. Through engagement with several different communities, including people with disabilities,LGBTQI+, seniors, youth, and ethnic minorities, there was a general acceptance of the useof a CVC as a measure to protect communities against the impact of COVID-19. The keyCOVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 8 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEfeedback was ensuring a CVC does not differentiate between those who are vaccinated andthose who are exempt for privacy reasons, and ensuring communication is clear andaccessible for a range of needs.16. We received mixed feedback from religious organisations. Some strongly opposed anyDmandatory use of CVCs or negative COVID-19 test to enter their premises as this wouldimpact the freedom of religious expression. Others were interested in having an option toEintroduce vaccine requirements, should they wish to. We do not propose mandating CVCuse in regular religious services or other social gatherings but instead providing the use ofCVCs as an option instead of the present number cap on such gatherings. SBusiness representativesA17. By engaging with tourism, hospitality, events and a range of sector representatives, it wasclear that there was overall support for the use of CVCs in particular settinEgs:a) Operators want a clear framework with easy to understand rules and guidance as toLwhich events and venues should or should not use CVCs.b) There is broad support across sectors for the use of CVCs if it is accompanied by clearEdirectives on where CVCs will be mandated to make it easier for operatorsc) The majority supported the exemption framework for individuals who could not bevaccinated because of health reasons and for childrenR.d) There was support for preventing the use of CVCs in key human-need settings andbroad agreement that this category should be q uite tight to protect workers in thosesettings (e.g. supermarkets) Ye) Clarity is needed on how CVCs link with employment matters, including expectations foremployees working at high-risk events and links to workplace vaccination requirements.L18. Officials also consulted with the COVID-19 Continuous Improvement Advisory Group, led byESir Brian Roche. They recommended a two-phase approach, starting with a broadapplication of the vaccination requirement to incentivise vaccination, followed by a periodVwhere the requirement could be scaled back to a smaller group of higher risk settings, oncehigh vaccination rates have been achieved.IData and digital elements oTf CVCs19. There was also feedback on the data and digital features of the CVC. This included seekingCclarity on what data would be collected and how it would be used, protection against fraud,and the continuity of the process in the event of a CVC system failure. Stakeholders wouldalso like claArity on how international vaccinations will be incorporated into a CVC system.Domestic settings for use of CVC requirementsOPublic Health advice on domestic settings for use of CVCsR20. Public health advice is there is a public health benefit to mandating a CVC at very largehigh-risk events. These events and settings have the greatest likelihood of becoming aPsuper-spreader event during a community outbreak. Public health considers that the riskiestevents and venues are those where there are large numbers of people, which continue for along period of time, where there is close interaction between attendees, and whereventilation is poor.21. Vaccinated close contacts are much less likely to become a positive COVID-19 case thanan unvaccinated close contact. This has flow-on benefits, in that it likely reducesCOVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 9 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEtransmission of the virus and also reduces the number of people who may eventually enterthe contact tracing system as contacts.22. There is a public health benefit in people being vaccinated at all high-risk settings, especiallywhen other public health measures may be impractical, such as settings where faceDcovering cannot always be worn (i.e. when eating and drinking, singing or exercising). Whenthis benefit is considered, there would also be a public health benefit in extending the use ofECVCs to a wider range of venues in the event of a community outbreak. Public heath advicenotes that depending on the incidence of COVID-19 in the community, a CVC would need tobe considered alongside other public health measures. S23. Public health advice also notes that while CVCs will reduce risk of transmission iAn aparticular setting, they will not eliminate this risk entirely, and in the event of a communityoutbreak, further measures may need to be implemented to address this risk.E24. Additionally, as the use of CVCs cannot fully eliminate transmission within a setting, CVCsalso will not prevent a vaccinated person who is infected with COVIDL-19 at an event,transmitting to non-vaccinated community members outside of the event, potentially leadingto a community outbreak. ERDomestic settings for mandated CVCs25. Officials note it will be important to balance the pub lic health rationale of CVCs withoperational concerns and interest in introducing Ythem more widely, while maintaining sociallicence and ensuring human rights are appropriately considered.L26. To account for the alternate measures when there is lower risk of transmission of COVID-19in the community, officials recommend mandated wider use of vaccine requirements be tiedEdirectly to Alert Level settings, and by proxy, risk of transmission of COVID-19 in thecommunity. CVC settings can be incorporated and aligned to any future decisions on newVframeworks, such as the proposed ‘traffic light’ framework.27. Officials have identified pIotential settings where CVCs could be mandated, as illustrated inTable 1. Officials haveT considered public health advice on CVCs, incorporated feedbackfrom stakeholders, and identified discretionary, non-essential settings where a CVC couldbe introduced in tChe event of a community outbreak.28. It is likely that as vaccination rates increase and the chances of moving to or remaining atAescalated Alert Levels decreases, the public health rationale and social licence for vaccinemandates in a wider range of settings diminishes. Public health advice is that vaccineOmandates should be considered as a temporary measure. Any introduction of CVCs willneed a review point, with officials identifying early 2022 as an appropriate point.R29.

In deciding how CVCs could be mandated at very large high-risk events, officials haveidentified two options:COVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 11 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCE• Mandating at Alert Level 1 only – this would minimise the likelihood that an event couldbecome a super-spreader event, however would not allow events to operate atescalated Alert Levels as they would likely still be subject to other public healthmeasures• Mandating at Alert Levels 1 and 2 – this would reduce risk of event being super-spreader Devent, while providing certainty to event organisers and patrons than an event has couldoperate. In some settings, additional public health measures may also be suitable.E31. Public health advice is that very large high-risk events should not be permitted to operate atAlert Levels higher than 1 or 2 even with a CVC due to the associated health risks. SHigh-risk indoor settingsA32. In mandating CVCs in high-risk indoor settings, this could be approached in several ways. Itis not recommended that CVCs be mandated at Alert Level 1, as there is inEsufficient publichealth rationale to justify the measure outside when community transmission is notoccurring.L33. CVCs could be mandated in high-risk indoor settings as specified above during Alert LevelE2. In Alert Level 2, CVCs could be considered in lieu of additional public health measuressuch as social distancing and face coverings. While risk of community transmission isRpresent, but lower than at Alert Level 3, CVCs can serve to add protection, particularly insettings where face coverings and distancing are not always practicable.34. Alternatively, they could be introduced alongsideY existing public health measures, and act asan additional public health measure to prevent transmission. This approach may result infewer businesses adopting CVCs at Alert Level 2, as they may consider them an additionalLcompliance cost without creating certainty for them and staff.E35. You may also wish to consider mandating CVCs at high-risk indoor settings during AlertLevel 3. At Alert Level 3, CVCs should only be considered alongside additional public healthVmeasures, such as capacity limits and social distancing. There is additional public healthrisk in this option, as it would enable a greater range of businesses to operate at escalatedAlert Levels. For instanceI, hospitality venues may be able to open with a vaccine mandateand additional public heTalth measures in place.CVCs should be prohCibited for patrons in specific venues and settings36. Given that businesses are legally able to implement a vaccination entry requirement forAcustomers, and that this could apply quite broadly, officials propose that the use of CVCs isprohibited in certain settings, to ensure that unvaccinated people are not prevented fromOaccessing basic life-preserving services.37. We consider that the Alert Level 4 services set out in Schedule 2 of the COVID-19 PublicRHealthResponse (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 11) 2021 are too broad to serve asa proxy for settings where CVCs should be prohibited for patrons. This is because certainPservices in Schedule 2, such as courts and judicial settings, may seek to use CVCsalongside other public health measures to continue operating. Also, prohibiting the use ofCVCs in a broad range of settings could outweigh the public health benefit of introducingCVCs to reduce the impacts of COVID-19 transmission.38. The primary legislation will need to be centred around an enabling provision, with furtherdetails on specific venues to be addressed in either secondary legislation or amendments.COVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 12 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEWe have suggested an initial list drawing from the Alert Level 4 businesses and services, asa list of settings where there is not a viable alternative option available, where patronscannot be required to present a CVC to enter. This includes:a) supermarketsb) pharmacies Dc) health services (other than pharmacies)d) food banksEe) petrol stationsf) entities required to provide learning for primary and secondary education - in teachingsettings and for students only except as part of the management of a case or outbrSeakconnected with or in the facilityA39. There will need to be further work on the extent to which CVCs are prohibited in classroomand teaching settings, as there may be a range of education settings captured in the higherEAlert Level categories unintentionally. Additionally, there may be some school basedsettings, such as concerts and graduations, where a CVC may wish to be considered. Wewill continue to engage with the Ministry of Education on these matteLrs and how best todifferentiate education settings.E40. CVCs will not be prohibited in other government services at this time, as there are a rangeof settings where it may be suitable to introduce a CVC. FRor example, the Ministry of Justiceadvises that will be important to provide an assurance of safety for those people who arecompelled to attend court, and we do not intend to impose a CVC requirement on peoplewho are compelled to attend court. However, the Ministry of Justice would like someYflexibility to require a CVC from others, if that was considered necessary to ensure publicsafety – for example, it may be appropriate to require a CVC from members of the publicLwho want to attend court.41. In creating a more enabling provisionE in the primary legislation, there is the option to expandthe prohibited category to include government services as appropriate. We will continue toengage with the Public ServiceV Commission on CVCs in government services.42. Prohibiting the use of CVC in specific venues and settings would apply to customers andIattendees only. WorkerTs would be subject to any applicable vaccine requirements toundertake work in certain settings, including those where CVCs are not permitted forpatrons. Mandating vaccines for types of work will progress through a risk-based frameworkCto determine vaccination and testing requirements for all work, which MBIE is developing inparallel.AOther settings can choose to implement a CVCO43. Officials had previously indicated that there was a broader ‘optional’ category, whereguidance would be provided for any operator to, at their discretion, implement a vaccinerequirement through CVCs.R44. There is still optionality for businesses and operators not specified in the settings framework,P however this is not explored in depth in this briefing. Feedback from stakeholders was thatthere was more need for a clear line as to where government saw CVCs being required. Ourapproach in seeking agreement on settings for mandating and prohibiting CVCs is intendedto clearly signal the settings where there will be legal requirements around the use of CVCs.45. We propose government develop guidelines to support uptake of vaccine requirements inother settings. Some businesses and operators have already signalled their plans toCOVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 13 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEintroduce their own vaccine mandates; and further advice will explore how they can beappropriately empowered and protected to do so.46. Guidance will need to make the legal position clear: that private bodies can limit the generalpublic from accessing their premises, as long as this does not amount to unlawfulDdiscrimination. This guidance will also need to include examples of what lawful/unlawfuldiscrimination might be. A clear statement of the legal position and how this translates toEreality will ensure any guidance is of practical use to businesses, and reduce the need forthem to seek their own advice (which could be onerous for smaller businesses).S47. There has been mixed interest from operators in lower risk settings (e.g. retail). Mandatingthe use of CVCs in these settings does not have a significantly strong enough puAblic healthrationale at this time, as alternate public health measures and social distancing are easier toimplement and enforce. In these contexts, government would provide the tools forEbusinesses and other parties to enable, appropriately limit and implement a vaccinationrequirement if they choose to put one in place – for example, providing documentation ofexemptions, and guidance – and monitoring the effectiveness and eqLuity of the use ofCVCs. There would also need to be an avoidance of doubt provision legislated to protectthose who may wish to implement CVCs. EPatron exemptions from vaccine requiremenRts in CVC settingsExemptions from vaccination entry requirements would be limited to those withmedical/health reasons and children under 12 years and 3 monthsY48. New Zealand’s COVID-19 vaccines have bLeen demonstrated to be sufficiently safe andeffective to be recommended for all from 12 years of age. There are very few situationswhere a vaccine is contraindicated anEd as such, medical exemption is expected to berarely required.49. The Ministry of Health recommeVnds permanently exempting a small number ofindividuals with clear contraindication to the Pfizer vaccine, according to the Medsafedatasheet and known preIcautions. The size of this group should decrease if a secondvaccine becomes availTable to offer the public. The size of this group is likely to bebetween 100-200 individuals and will rely on a robust process for providing medicalexemptions for geCnuine medical reasons.50. A small number of other people could be temporarily exempted for other reasonsincluding thAe following:• A severe reaction to dose 1• A severe reaction with no identifiable causeO• Post infection• Undergoing acute major surgeryR• A severely autistic person who injured themselves during prior administration of thePfizer vaccine and needing delay for additional resources to facilitate a safeadministration of a second doseP51.The Ministry of Health does not recommend exempting people outside of the groupabove, even if they have had negative reactions or experiences with other vaccines in thepast. It is likely that these people can be safely vaccinated with extra precautions andcare for their wellbeing.COVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 14 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCE52. People with disabilities will not be exempt unless they have a clear contraindication tohaving the Pfizer vaccine. As is the case generally, the benefits of receiving the vaccineoutweigh any risks.53. Officials are considering the process through which a person could apply for anDexemption. One possible process would be for a person to request their generalpractitioner to write to the Ministry of Health. The request would then be processed by anEexemptions team and, if successful, the exemption status would be registered in theCOVID Immunisation Register and a CVC issued. Provided the total number of exemptedpersons in the country remains in the low hundreds, the processing of the exemptions Swould not be overly administratively burdensome.A54. By exempting those under 12 years and 3 months, we are assuming a high-trust model.As there may be operational challenges with requesting identification from adolescents,Evenues will need to use their discretion when requesting supplementary identificationfrom those under 18.LAlternate measures for those exempted from CVC requirements, such as a negative COVID-19 test, are no longer recommended E55. We propose that due to the very small number of people Rexpected to be legitimately exempt,that an alternative measure, such as a negative PCR test, is not recommended. There arefeasibility issues with enforcing a testing measure on children, and the projected number ofthose with legitimate health exemptions is relatively small, and therefore reasonably low risk.YAt this stage, we do not recommend using proof of recovery from COVID-19 as analternative measure, as at present, there has not been widespread COVID-19 infection inNew Zealand, meaning this would not be aLvailable for most people. This may need to berevisited in future.Es9(2)(h)Vs9(2)(h)56.ITCs9(2)(h)57.As9(2)(h)58.ORPs9(2)(h)59.COVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 15 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEs9(2)(h)DESAEL60. s9(2)(h) ERYExemptions framework61. On the basis of the above approach, officiaLls have developed the following exemptionsframework:EExemption from Evidence to V Rationaleusing CVCs present for entryChildren under the Not requirIed Children under the age of 12 are not eligible for vaccination inage of 12 years T New Zealand.

The CVC will be constructed so that those who are fully vaccinated and those with legitimatemedical exemptions will appear equally authorised to the verifier/venue staff. The Ministry ofHealth is developing a verifier app that will allow event organisers and venue security toDscan the QR code on the vaccine certificate to confirm its validity, with either a mobile phoneor a scanning device. Confirmation would be displayed as a green tick or a red cross. Thegreen tick would either mean that the person was vaccinated or exempt. The QR code will Ebe available digitally, with a paper option to ensure accessibility. Data from the QR code willnot be stored by the verifier, to ensure privacy is preserved. S63. The Ministry of Health has consulted with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner whoArecommended that the app should be designed to be as privacy-preserving as possible. Asthe scanning of apps is likely to be undertaken by event and venue security guards,restaurant and café staff, and others, there is a strong case for the confirmEation green tickbeing identical for both vaccinated and exempt people. This would:• avoid scanning staff seeing attendees’ private medical informatioLn,• eliminate the possibility of scanning staff asking for further information about attendees’exemptions, and E• prevent businesses from discriminating against exempted persons.R64. Should this approach be adopted, CVCs could not by proxy prove if an individual has beenfully vaccinated. Rather, they would demonstrate that an individual is authorised to enter asetting by either being fully vaccinated or legitimately exempt from vaccination based onYhealth or medical grounds. In settings where there is a vaccine mandate with noexemptions, a CVC would not be a useful tool to determine vaccination status should thisapproach be adopted. In settings where thLere may be a vaccine mandate, such as toundertake certain types of work, it is anticipated that alternative proof of vaccination couldbe presented. E65. Vaccination information should not be collected, held or used by venues. The Ministry ofVHealth will provide further advice on how this will be accounted for in the CVC and verifierecosystem.ITOverseas vaccinations66. Work is underwayC to establish policy and pathways for people who have been vaccinatedoverseas to obtain a domestic CVC. This relates to which overseas administered COVID-19vaccinations can be recorded against an individual’s health record for people now living inANew Zealand, and how domestic vaccination certificates can be issued to people who arevisiting New Zealand for a short period.O67. For domestic CVCs, key policy considerations include:a) Whether CVCs would be issued to anyone who has been fully vaccinated againstRCOVID-19 overseas, with any vaccine. Under the new 1 November 2021 pre-entryrequirement for non-New Zealand citizens to be vaccinated against COVID-19 prior toP arrival to New Zealand by air - any vaccine that has been approved a government or anauthority (or an approved combination of those vaccines in their origin country) would beaccepted at the border. This list was intentionally broad given the issues of vaccineequity and that all arrivals will undergo testing and 14 days MIQ. Currently there are 22such vaccines on this list. Officials are seeking public health advice on whether all ofthese, or only a subset, would be acceptable for a domestic certificate, where the aim isCOVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 17 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEto reduce the risk of transmission in high risk settings.b) What form of proof of vaccination would need to be shown, and to whom in order toobtain a domestic CVC. Currently, there is considerable variation in vaccinationcertificates being issued internationally. Most of which are paper based, may or may notDbe in English, and have no security features, which make them prone to fraud andfalsification. A small but increasing number of countries are now issuing verifiable digitalEcertificates (with a scannable QR code) to prove a COVID-19 vaccination or test result.Further work is required to determine if other forms of proof, including letters or cards,will be accepted so as to be issued with a domestic CVC. Proof that can be electroSnicallyverified is considerably more scalable, but will need to be supported with accessible non-digital options. Key considerations are the trade-offs of a high trust and high iAnclusionapproach versus a low trust and high exclusion approach.E68. There are several options for how people who have received their COVID-19 vaccinationoverseas might be able to request a domestic CVC.a) For people already in New Zealand, officials are investigating sevLeral methods forconverting an international record of vaccination into a CVC, and/or adding that record toa person’s health records (in the COVID Immunity Record).E This includes leveragingdigital self-service channels like My Covid Record, supported by assisted servicechannels like call centres and GPs. Rb) In future, for people entering New Zealand there is a possible integration with the TravelHealth Declaration System being developed by Customs NZ. This would allow a personYentering New Zealand with proof of vaccination to be automatically issued with adomestic CVC. The Travel Health Declaration System is expected to be in place at theend of the first quarter 2022. LETimeframesV69. The Ministry of Health is working to the following timeframes for implementing the CVC:Phase 1 I • Online portal to view COVID-19 vaccinationT recordsMy COVID Record & interim period• Targeted invitations to domestic individuals(12 Oct – early November)C with first or second vaccination• Manual support channels availablePhase 2 • Vaccine certificate via email in PDF formA• Verifier app that can read certificates andPiloted non-mandated usecommunicate authorisation to enter venue(early NOovember)• Operational framework for Verifier appusage• Pilot ticketed eventsRPhase3 • Events and/or environments that meetdefined Verifier requirements mayP General non-mandated useparticipate(late November)Phase 4 • Events and/or environments that meetdefined Verifier requirements mustGeneral mandated useparticipate - assumptionfollowing product testingCOVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 18 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCE70. The Ministry of Health advises that consideration should be given to building in a short gapbetween the launch of the technical solution and mandating use. A short gap would allowany issues with public and business understanding of how to use the CVC product to beDresolved and certificate requests where human intervention is needed to be processed(there will likely be a subset of NHI’s where matching and data quality issues may requirehuman intervention). This gap would also give time for exemptions to be processed by GPs Eand health professionals, and the Ministry of Health exemption team; and for businesses tobe operationally ready to use the product. SWorker vaccination requirements across domestic settingsA71. Public health advice remains that workers in settings where a CVC is required for theEgeneral public/customers should also be vaccinated, to maintain the intention of themeasure.LThere should be a duty on both workers and their employers/Person Conducting a Business orUndertaking (PCBUs)E72. We recommend a double-barrelled duty, similar to the approach taken for border and MIQworkers. In other words, there would be a duty on workerRs not to work at high-risk eventsand settings without being vaccinated, and also a duty on PCBUs/employers not to allowworkers to work at high-risk events and settings without being vaccinated.PCBUs/employers could also be required to cooYperate with PCBUs who are running theevent/venue to ensure workers do not undertake specified work without being vaccinated.L73. Similar to the requirements for attendees, workers who have a medical reason for not beingvaccinated would be exempt from the vaccination requirement. We consider it also desirableEto allow one-off exceptions in certain circumstances. The threshold for this should be thesame as in the Vaccinations Order for border and MIQ workers: that work is unanticipated,necessary and time-critical andV cannot be carried out by a person who is unvaccinated, andmust be carried out to prevent the ceasing of operations. Further work is needed on whocould approve these exceIptions, and appropriate checks on approvals.TWorkers will not need CVCs to prove they are vaccinatedC74. While members of the public will need to use a CVC to enter high-risk events and venues,workers will not necessarily need to do the same. Instead, they may need to prove that theyare vaccinaAted (or medically exempt) to their PCBU/employer. A CVC, which will notdistinguish between vaccination and medical exemptions, may not be sufficient in somecircumstances.O75. Employers/PCBUs will likely need to retain their own records about workers’ vaccinationRstatus. A centralised register (as with border and MIQ workers) is neither needed norfeasible given the likely scale of high-risk events.P Employment law will determine the outcome for unvaccinated employees76. Based on information available, we have not been able to assess the potential size of theworkforce covered by this proposal.77. Unvaccinated employees may face changes to their work duties/arrangements (egredeployment to non-high-risk work) or need to take leave. Employers and employees canagree any option among themselves that is lawful. However, stakeholders have saidCOVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 19 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEredeployment options are limited within the workplaces covered. This could mean thatredundancy or termination of employment are likely when the requirement comes into force.78. For some workplaces where CVCs are mandatory for customers and workers, it is likely thatCOVID-19 vaccination will become a condition of new employment, and that employmentDwill not be offered without proof of vaccination. Discrimination on an individual basis can stillbe challenged if unlawful.EA framework for vaccination and testing requirements for all workS79. More broadly, MBIE is leading work on a single public health risk-based framework todetermine vaccination and testing requirements for all work. Further work on vaccinationrequirements for workers at very large high-risk settings and high-risk indoor settAings will beprogressed through that work, in alignment with the specific definitions of high-risk eventsfor CVCs. ELegal mechanisms and enforcement [legally privileged]Ls9(2)(h)80.ERs9(2)(h)81.YLEs9(2)(h)82.VITCs9(2)(h)83.AOTRe Tiriti o Waitangi considerations84. In developing approaches to CVCs, we have considered the distinct rights and interests ofPMāori to understand Te Tiriti o Waitangi considerations. We have informed where distinctMāori interests arise from through feedback from Te Arawhiti, Te Puni Kōkiri, DPMC’sCommunity Panel and at a ministerial level, the National Iwi Chairs Forum (NICF). Theseinterests include the Crown’s duty to protect Māori health equitably and actively, protectMāori cultural activities and the Crown’s responsibility to address the disproportionately lowvaccine uptake by Māori. Engagement with Māori as the Treaty Partner has occurred on aCOVID-19 VACCINE CERTIFICATES – SETTINGS FOR DOMESTIC USE Report No.4446564DPMC-2021/22-585 Page 20 of 28IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEtargeted limited basis as summarised in Attachment B.85. The use of CVCs would positively impact the Crown’s duty to support equitable healthoutcomes for Māori by providing another tool to support the public health response toCOVID-19. The development of where CVCs should be applied considers the heightened Drisk of negative health impacts of COVID-19 transmission disproportionately affecting Māorito reduce the impact of COVID-19 transmission with the use of CVCs and other publicEhealth measures. This could provide opportunities for Māori organisations and businessesinterested in opportunities provided by CVCs to operate and to support safety of attendees.S86. Currently, the disproportionately lower vaccination levels for Māori means that distinguishingaccess to domestic settings based on vaccination status would have greater restArictions onpersonal freedom for Māori on an individual and collective basis. The option to introducerequirements for very large high-risk events (e.g., music festivals) would minimise the levelEof restriction due to being for a focused list of events. It would have an impact on large,Māori-organised events (e.g., Te Matatini, Waka Ama Sprint Nationals). The NICF andDPMC Community Panel recommended that Marae, Māori businessLes and event organisersshould decide how to operate with CVCs, for example through developing guidance, andhow to communicate the use of CVCs. Te Matatini organisers hEave already been proactiveby introducing vaccination requirements for attendees.R87. A use of CVC requirements in a broader set of high-risk indoor settings (e.g., hospitality)would support reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission alongside other public healthmeasures but has even greater restrictions on Māori in their ability to access venues andYevents. This could negatively impact the trust that has been built for the COVID-19vaccination rollout and could enhance vaccine hesitancy. To reduce the impact of this, aLcommunication strategy could be developed to work with Māori to support the use of CVCs.It was also raised through the DPMC Community Panel that Māori-led communicationsEcould better support trust and ability to build understanding about using CVC as a publichealth tool against COVID-19.V88. For the operationalisation of CVCs, the Crown should ensure that there are minimal barriersfor people to have a CVCI, addressing digital equity concerns and proactively addressingprivacy and data soverTeignty issues should they arise. This would also address privacyconcerns on the use of data, although note that the proposed use of CVCs will not storedata. CFinancial ImplicationsA89. There are no financial implications with the proposals in this paper.ONext StepsR90.

There were 51 new cases identified in thercommunityin the 24 hours to 9am Sunday 17 October, 47 in Auckland and 4P in the Waikato. There were no new cases identified in Northland.7 The 14 October Public Health Risk Assessment notes a high risk ofcommunity transmission in Auckland, with the outbreak now becoming morewidespread, affecting more ethnic groups, with more exposure events per dayand with more exposure events occurring outside of the home and essentialworkplaces. Case numbers are currently growing with an R value of between1.2 and 1.3. The risk of community transmission in the rest of New Zealand(excluding Waikato and Northland) remains low.1SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VE8 The Director-General of Health’s interim public health advice notes that, giventhe increase in unlinked cases, caution is advised regarding the outbreakwithin the Auckland region and continued close monitoring is required. Toensure the outbreak is contained, it is critical to retain the current Alert Level 3restrictions. The potential for COVID-19 to leak outside the Alert Level 3/2boundary means Alert Level 2 restrictions must continue to be reinforced dacross the rest of New Zealand.e9 On the basis of the latest public health risk assessment and the Director-General of Health’s interim advice, I propose Cabinet agrees to:s9.1 keep Auckland at the current Alert Level 3 (the first stage of the three-astage reduction); and9.2 keep the rest of New Zealand outside the Alert Leveel 3 areas at AlertLevel 2.l10 The Director-General will provide an oral update teo Cabinet today on thesituation and appropriate Alert Level in the Waikato and Northland AlertLevel 3 areas. I propose the country’s Alert RLevel settings are next reviewedby Cabinet on Monday 1 November.11 On Monday 11 October, Cabinet agr eed to confirm the arrangements andconditions for the reopening of Auckland education entities (schools and earlyylearning services) from Tuesday 26 October at today’s meeting [CAB-21-MIN-0415 refers]. The interim public advice is to defer the reopening of theseleducation services until afeter Tuesday 26 October because of the upwardtrajectory of cases in Auckland, increased transmission risk in educationsettings and their associated movement across the region, and deferredveffectiveness of vaccines. In light of this, I propose we defer the full reopeningallow more children and young people to return to education entities iniAuckland unttil 1 November at the earliest, subject to updated public healthadvice. But given the proximity of exams, I would like us to carefully considercwhether the benefits of secondary students, who are eligible for vaccination,returaning to school earlier are outweighed by the risks of increasedtransmission.o12 There has been some uncertainty and confusion from the public and impactedsectors about what businesses and services will be able to operate at stagertwoof Auckland’s reduced Alert Level 3 settings. I am not recommendingP Auckland shift to stage two this week. However, I propose we signal that ashift to stage two is unlikely in the near term, but reassure the public that moredetailed information about the stage two settings will be communicated priorto any shift occurring.13 Given the high risk of transmission within Auckland and the need to ensureCOVID-19 is not transmitted outside of the Alert Level boundary, I do notpropose to enable more permissions for crossing Alert Level boundaries atthis stage. Further advice on permissions for building and construction andeducation will be provided at the next Alert Level review.2SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33desaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VEThese scenarios are defined in terms of their starting R values in the weekeffcommencing 6 October, but the R decreases over time to capture theeffbenefits of increasing rates of vaccination within Auckland.119 In reality, R will not behave this way over time. There are a number ofefffactors which will drive R (which each come with time lags before they will deffinfluence daily case numbers) including:e19.1 vaccination rates increasing (included in this model);s19.2 Alert Level changes in response to public health risk;a19.3 compliance potentially falling over time;19.4 changing testing rates and degrading performancee of contact tracing(crudely included in the model, creating the “kink” in Fig 0);l19.5 changing demographic structure of the infected population; ande19.6 societal concern about the risk of being infected changing behaviour.R20 These scenarios show that:20.1 If a low R (i.e. less than 1.2 and decreasing) is achieved over theeffycoming weeks then the vaccination campaign will support a gradualreduction to very low caseloads. In these scenarios, new daily caseslmay be in the region of around 10 per day by mid-December.e20.2 If R maintains a level at or above 1.3, even as vaccination rateseffincrease, thenv the vaccination campaign cannot be expected tomaterially restrict an exponential growth in cases into the medium-term,leading tio hundreds or thousands of cases a day by late Decemberwithoutt additional interventions.c20.3 Based on current estimates of R , and current expectations for theeffabenefits of increasing vaccination coverage, (the “R = 1.3” scenario),effvaccination may act to limit transmission in the medium term such thato ongoing caseloads remain fairly stable, in the region of 100 new casesper day.rP1 The chart includes a “kink” which relates to an assumption of contact tracing performance degradingafter a point.4SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33desaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VEDirector-General of Health’s assessment against the health factorsLikelihood that the Auckland outbreak is contained24 The Auckland outbreak is not contained. There remains a heightened risk ofcases being seeded from Auckland to other parts of New Zealand, as shown dby the community cases detected in Waikato, Northland and PalmerstonNorth. e25 As at 9am Wednesday 13 October, there have been 1,665 cases in thesAuckland region and 493 of these cases remain active. This month there hasbeen an exponential growth of cases with the effective reproductive numberanow around 1.3. Over the past fortnight there has been a dispersion of casescross Auckland (rather than occurring mainly in South Auckland). Ethnicallyethe greatest proportion of cases are Māori, followed by European/Other.26 As at 11am Wednesday 13 October, there have beeln 37 cases reported ineWaikato. The source of infection was unknown and the risk of communitytransmission within Waikato was considered medium. There has been onepositive case detected in Northland and theRre remains a risk of transmissionoccurring.27 There have been no positive cases d etected in the rest of New Zealand(excluding Waikato and Northlandy) since an essential worker in PalmerstonNorth tested positive on Sunday 3 October.leUpdate on unlinked cases and sub-clusters of concern28 There has been a sivgnificant increase in the number of unlinked cases inAuckland. The increase in unlinked cases is in part due to there being lessinvestigation ofi the source of infection as the Auckland Regional Public HealthService movets to a more sustainable case investigation model as casenumbers icncrease. However, there is likely to be an actual increase inunlinked cases.a29 As at Wednesday 13 October, there were a total of 30 subclusters, 16epidemiologically linked subclusters (four active, one contained and 11odormant)and 14 epidemiologically unlinked subclusters (four active, onecontained and nine dormant).rP30Cases associated with the original clusters are decreasing. In late August,three new sub-clusters emerged and have provided the majority of new casesover the last two weeks. During October, the proportion of cases infectious inthe community has been consistently about 50 percent.31 Of the 1,719 community cases identified as at 9am Wednesday 13 October,NCTS reports 1,612 (94 percent) are epidemiologically linked or connected toa cluster, 107 are unlinked to the initial clusters with investigations for a linkongoing, and 75 cases are unlinked within the last 14 days.6SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VETesting rates32 There is confidence in the capability and capacity of the laboratory testingsystem. Since the move to Alert Level 4 on Wednesday 18 August, 1,073,515tests have been processed in the laboratories across the country as atmidnight Tuesday 12 October. The median processing time between when a dtest is taken and the result is produced is 17 hours.e33 Overall, testing rates have been high in the Auckland region, particularly in thepopulations most impacted by the outbreak. In Auckland, rates of testing havesbeen reasonably stable with a dip in weekend testing rates which is usuallyseen. In the rest of the country the testing rates have been either stable oradecreasing, except for Waikato which has increased markedly.34 Enhanced surveillance testing continues in the Auckland eregion. Thisincludes specific testing efforts in South and West Auckland and in residentialhousing facilities. On Tuesday 12 October, 12,965 pleople were tested acrossthe Auckland Metro region (excluding both MIF gueest and MIF worker testing),with a 7-day rolling average of 12,834. There has been increased levels ofessential worker testing. Since 20 September, 90,820 essential workers haveRbeen tested. On 12 October, 4,216 essential workers were tested.35 As at 5pm Tuesday 12 October, there were ongoing wastewater surveillancedetections at multiple sites across Auckland. There have been no unexpectedyrecent wastewater detections outside the Waikato, Auckland and PalmerstonNorth areas.leVaccination ratesv36 Vaccination rates are increasing overall since the previous risk assessmenton 7 October. As of Sunday 17 October, 89 percent of the eligible populationiin Auckland have received one dose, and 71 percent have received both.tHowever, the full impact of vaccination will not be realised until two weekscafter the second dose.a37 There are still inequities in coverage by age group and ethnicity. Lowervaccination rates for Māori under the age of 50 can be observed across theocountry.For Pacific peoples, there are lower vaccination rates for those aged12 to 34 across the country. For other ethnic groups, there are lowerrvaccination rates for those aged 12 to 34 outside of Auckland. The Ministry ofP Health are working to address these inequities and will provide more advice toCabinet on progress to improve Māori and Pacific vaccination rates as part offuture updates. Targeted vaccination events such as “Super Saturday” arehoped to increase vaccination rates across all ethnicities and ages.38 An overview of vaccination rates, broken down by District Health Board, ageand ethnicity is provided at Appendix 1.7SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VEHealth system capacity including surveillance and contact tracing systems39 As at 9am Sunday 17 October, there are 29 hospitalisations associated withthe current outbreak (26 are active cases and three are recovered), with fiveof those in ICU/HDU and two requiring ventilation. ICU occupancy as at15 October is 66.8 percent, with 17.7 percent of ventilators in use. Across dAuckland, ICU occupancy is 75.5 percent at Auckland DHB, 32 percent atCounties Manukau DHB, and 42.9 percent at Waitematā DHB.e40 The Ministry's National PPE and Critical Medical Supply Chain has goodsstocks of PPE. There are no concerns with supply chain for reagents,consumables and swabs.a41 There have been a total of 39,368 contacts associated with this outbreak todate. Of these 39,368 contacts, 36,517 are Close contactes (33,245 or 91percent have been contacted and advised to isolate and be tested), 2,334 areHousehold contacts (2,241 or 96 percent have beenl contacted and advised tobe isolated and tested) and 517 are non-househoeld Close Plus contacts (482or 93 percent have been contacted and advised to be isolated and tested). Asat Sunday 18 October, there are 1,896 open contacts.R42 As of Friday 15 October, a revised strategy for the management of casualplus contacts was implemented. The advice to casual plus contacts willremain the same but casual plus contacts will be advised to self-manage andywill not be entered into the National Contact Tracing Solution. As a result,casual plus contacts are no longer be reported on.le43 As signalled previously, case and contacts management has become morecomplex due to the communities that have been affected and the associatedvlevel of support required to ensure necessary engagement with the publichealth advice. Public health units advise that each of these cases is taking upithe time of two less complex cases, placing strain on the workforce. Additionaltsupport is being provided by public health units outside of Auckland andcNational Investigation and Tracing Centre surge capacity has been activated.a44 Health workforce for MIQs in Auckland is reaching its limits and work isunderway to redeploy staff from across the motu. The number of cases fromothecommunity being managed within the MIQ systems is presentingadditional stress on the system. As at 8am Thursday 14 October, there arer265 MIQ rooms and 35 close contact rooms available across the country.Officials are considering options to free up capacity in MIQ facilities. ThesePinclude options of self-isolation, reduced quarantine period and short stayoptions.Director-General of Health’s conclusions45 Based on the most recent public health risk assessment completed onThursday 14 October, the Director-General’s interim health assessment is:45.1 The risk of community transmission in Auckland remains high as thereis a likelihood of undetected community transmission across Auckland.8SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VE45.2 The risk of community transmission for the rest of New Zealand(excluding Waikato and Northland) is low, but there is potential forCOVID-19 to seed outside of Auckland.46 The Director-General’s interim public health advice is therefore that:d46.1 Auckland should remain at Alert Level 3 (stage one of the three-stagereduction in restrictions);e46.2 the rest of New Zealand outside of the Alert Level 3 areas shouldsremain at Alert Level 2; anda46.3 a continued drive to increase vaccination rates (particularly for agegroups and ethnicities with currently low rates) is needed, as iscontinued active testing, targeted communications eto reinforce andimprove compliance, and continued encouragement for the public to betested if they are a contact or have COVID-1l9 symptoms.eProposal regarding Alert LevelsR47 On the basis of the latest public health risk assessment and the Director-General’s interim public health advice, I propose Cabinet agrees to:47.1 keep Auckland at the curreynt Alert Level 3 (the first stage of the three-stage reduction); andl47.2 keep the rest of Neew Zealand outside the Alert Level 3 areas at AlertLevel 2.v48 The Director-General will provide an oral update on the latest situation andappropriate Alert Level in the Waikato and Northland Alert Level 3 areasitoday.tc49 I propose these settings are reviewed by Cabinet on Monday 1 November.aAssessment of the proposed measures/options against the non-health factorso50 I have assessed the options against the non-health factors agreed by Cabinet,as set out below. On balance, the assessment supports the proposals in thisrpaper.P51It is positive that high-frequency economic indicators point to increasedeconomic activity in Auckland since moving down to Alert Level 3, but activityis reducing in the Waikato Alert Level 3 area. Improved economic activity islikely contributing to a fall in the uptake of most grants and benefits across thecountry.52 I remain concerned about the social impact of enduring Alert Levelrestrictions, noting that impacts on at risk populations persist. There are mixedreactions to new requirements and adjustments to Alert Level restrictions.9SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33desaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VEsimilar level to before lockdown. The Auckland region is now receiving 31percent of all food grants, similar to the week before lockdown, after peakingat 38 percent in early September.57 The August 2021 Resurgence Support Payment Scheme has also had stronguptake with $1.1 billion paid across the three payments as of Wednesday d13 October (the third payment opened on Friday 8 October). Most support(around 93 percent of recipients as of 8 October) has been for businessesewith fewer than 10 FTEs.sImpacts on at-risk populationsa58 The issues raised in previous Alert Level reviews continue to persist despitethe gradual easing of Alert Level restrictions in some parts of the country.eThese include, but are not limited to: ongoing restrictions on earning capacity;inequitable access to material essentials; issues related to education andllearning; issues related to face covering exemptions, particularly for disabledepeople; strong and ongoing demand for mental health support services; andcontinued discrimination targeted towards Pacific peoples and disabledpeople. R59 Additional updates on population impacts from the past week include:59.1 Māori businesses and servyices are grappling with how to responsiblyhelp their employees get vaccinated, while managing Alert Level-related business stresls, reduced resiliency and ability to plan for thefuture. Access to diegital education resources and tools is also aconcern for Māori, particularly as school closures endure. Shifting tomore sustainavble and manageable ways of working and supportingMāori communities and services is needed.i59.2 Progretss continues to be made on increasing vaccination rates ofPaccific people. The Ministry for Pacific Peoples continues to delivertargeted information campaigns to Pacific communities nationally. Thisaincludes regular information about locations of interest, Alert Levelssettings, getting tested, and vaccinations in English and nine PacificLanguages.o59.3Concern from ethnic communities around the impact of prolongedrrestrictions on mental health, wellbeing and isolation (especially forP older people) is becoming more pronounced, especially as new casesemerge outside of Auckland.59.4 Disabled people will likely be relieved by the new mandatoryvaccination requirements, but may also be concerned about thepotential impact of this requirement on supports if carers choose not tobe vaccinated. The Disabled Persons Assembly is reportedly finding itdifficult to keep up with requests for face covering exemption cardsbecause access to these cards is being abused by people who areopposed to face coverings.11SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VE59.5 Older people are experiencing reduced clarity and certainty followingmore frequent adjustments to Alert Level settings. Some older peoplemay be less likely to leave their homes as a result, leading to increasedloneliness and isolation and reduced ability to fully participate in society(e.g. to seek medical advice and to participate in social activities). Clarityaround the need for booster vaccination shots also continues to be dsought by older people.e59.6 As reported last week, the level of harm and nature of the violence whereincidents of family and sexual violence are occurring continues to beshigh. Increased support is being provided for MIQ facilities, followingreports of family harm incidents in some of these facilities.a59.7 There was a 30 percent decrease in the number of contacts witheYouthline Helpline this week compared to last week, from 490 to 343.The number of incident reports has also decreased by 44 percent, from117 to 66 this week, of which nine required lexternal intervention. Thisetrend is expected during the school holidays, when young people aregetting more support from, and communicating more regularly with,whānau and friends. RPublic attitudes and compliance60 Research conducted over the pasyt week indicated continued confusion aboutAuckland’s staged reduction in Alert Level 3 settings. This confusion is addingto the ambiguity of what Newl Zealand’s overall COVID-19 strategy is. Moreeinformation about the adjusted Alert Level 3 settings, including specificexamples about permissible activities, was recommended by researchparticipants. In genevral, people in Auckland are disheartened by those notcomplying with Alert Level restrictions and are feeling tired of living “week toweek”. it61 Social mecdia about mandatory vaccination for workers in the health, disabilityand education sectors indicated mixed reactions. Some people expressedhappainess and a desire for the mandate to be expanded to other sectors, withothers perceiving the decision as a backtrack on Government’s word not toomandate vaccinations in New Zealand. At the same time, others arediscussing vaccination certificates, with some noting that they booked theirvaccination in anticipation of their introduction.rP62Between 11.59pm Tuesday 21 September and 5pm Wednesday 13 October,New Zealand Police have undertaken 12,083 pandemic-related events inAuckland, Northland and parts of the Waikato (up from 8,471 last week). Atotal of 3,691 online 105 breach notifications were received from members ofthe public over the same period (up from 2589 last week, with the 3,691notifications made up of 3,406 in Alert Level 3 areas and 285 in Alert Level 2areas).63 Since Wednesday 22 September, 698 pandemic-related infringement noticeshave been issued by Police (up from 591 last week), with non-complianceprincipally relating to stay-at-home orders and failure to maintain physical12SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VEdistancing requirements. Over the same period, 20 people have beenprosecuted and 25 people have received warnings.64 Generally, compliance at the boundary remains high and motorists arecarrying the required evidence to demonstrate their permitted reason totravel. Overall, only around one percent of vehicles have been turned daround. Compliance is lower for heavy motor vehicles with 3.4 percent of the33,521 heavy vehicles stopped at the boundary over the week to 12 Octobeerbeing turned around.sAbility to operationalise Alert Level restrictionsa65 I am not proposing any changes to Alert Level settings or Alert Level 3/2boundary permissions in this paper. The proposals do not present additionaloperational challenges. Operational pressures on Police ceontinue as AlertLevel restrictions endure, especially considering the resource required in MIQand at checkpoints. With increasing numbers of poslitive COVID-19 cases,Police is playing a greater role in investigation of bereaches and locatinguncooperative individuals. This is requiring a trade off in investigativecapability. R66 There will be operational impacts when education entities reopen in Auckland.Officials will provide advice on opera tional implications of reopening educationentities in Auckland when decisioyns to confirm reopening dates are sought.These will require a lead in time to operationalise.leAlert Level BoundariesvUpdate on current boundaries67 Alert Level bouindaries have remained in place whilst both Northland and thetWaikato have been at Alert Level 3, to continue minimising movementsacross Alecrt Level areas and between the three Alert Level 3 areas.68 Sincea Monday 6 September, when Cabinet initially agreed settings for an AlertLevel 3/2 boundary, permissions have been amended on an ongoing basis.oPermissions are largely limited to people undertaking essential and permittedwork, and a small number of permissions for individuals to cross the boundaryfor non-work purposes, including permanently relocating, shared caregiving,randemergencies.P69On average, Air New Zealand carries 355 passengers out of, and 327passengers into, Auckland each day under Alert Level 3/2 settings.70 As at 8am Thursday 14 October, there had been 16,669 requests for personalexemptions, with 16,043 decisions made and 2,934 approved. Most approvalsrelate to funerals/tangihanga, visiting a dying person, and need for mentalhealth support.13SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VEAmendments to Alert Level boundary permissions are not recommended at this point71 On 11 October, Cabinet noted that officials would provide further advice onMonday, 18 October 2021 on:71.1 proposed amendments to Alert Level 3/2 boundary permissions todenable building and construction of infrastructure that contributes togovernment priority projects; ande71.2 any outstanding issues, including seeking agreement to amended AlertLevel 3/2 boundary permissions, to support any decision to resopenAuckland educational facilities for all students in the coming weeks.aAdditional permissions for building and constructione72 The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is continuing towork with the building and construction sector to understand and mitigate thelpressures facing the industry. The ongoing inabiliety to have workers crossboundaries is delaying the building of infrastructure, including that connectedto government priorities, and impacting the viability of some businesses.R73 MBIE want to expand the permitted movements to more projects that arenationally important, and to allow workers to collect tools and materials thatare stranded on the other side of the Alert Level boundary.y74 However, given the risk of community transmission in Auckland is high, thelPublic Health Risk Assessment does not support the expansion of permittedemovements across the Alert Level 3/2 boundary at this time. Accordingly, Irecommend that Cabinet defer decisions on the expansion of Alert Levelvpermissions for building and construction until the next review of Alert Levels.iAdditional permissiotns for educationc75 In order to enable the re-opening of schools, kura and early learning services,additional permissions to cross Alert Level boundaries will be required for dayastudents, children, teachers and support staff who live on the other side of theAlert Level boundary from their place of learning.4 Parents or caregiversowouldbe able to accompany children across Alert Level boundaries throughthe existing permission to “accompany any person… if it is reasonablyrnecessary” under item 19 of schedule 5 of the Alert Level Order.P76Accordingly, I propose that when Cabinet considers the reopening ofeducational facilities, we consider adding students, teachers and support staffwho live on the other side of an Alert Level boundary to their educationalfacility to the list of individuals permitted to transit Alert Level boundaries.

Thisillustrates the challenges we face with declining social licence and complianceamongst sectors of the Auckland community.83 One option could be to restrict the number of bubbles able to join together asan extended bubble (e.g. a maximum of two or three households). Thedefinition of “extended bubble arrangement” in clause 4 of the COVID-19Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 12) 2021currently permits “two or more” homes or places of residences to jointogether for the purposes of keeping connections with family or whānau,enable caregiving or to support people living alone or otherwise isolated.15SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VEDespite this, it is likely most people assume an extended bubble can only bemade up of up to two households.84 Further, the increase in gatherings that are not permitted suggests tighteningrules (or returning to Alert Level 4) would not necessarily have the intendedeffect, and that enforcement and public communications remain critical. dContinuing to provide as much clarity as possible about what is and is notpermissible is especially important, as is ensuring the right support is eavailable for those feeling isolated.sFurther advice on reopening of Auckland schools and early learning servicesto all students aEducation decisions that have already been taken e85 At Alert Level 3, children and young people in years 1 to 10 can only go tolschool if their parents are required to work and there is no other optioneavailable. This means that only a very small number of children and youngpeople will go back to onsite learning at the beginning of term 4 today.RFollowing Cabinet decisions on 4 October, children are able to attend earlylearning services, but this is limited by the capacity of individual early learningservices to maintain separate bubbles of ten children [CAB-21-MIN-0407refers]. Tertiary settings are open at Alert Level 3 if delivery is not possibleyonline, they can operate in bubbles of 10 or less, and can meet health andsafety restrictions.le86 On 4 October, Cabinet noted advice from officials that Auckland schools couldreopen to all year 1 to 13 students from Monday 18 October, subject to latestvpublic health advice and appropriate public health controls being in place[CAB-21-MIN-0407 refers].it87 On Monday 11 October, Cabinet agreed to delay decisions on schools and tocconfirm the arrangements and conditions for the reopening of Aucklandeducation entities to all learners from Tuesday 26 October at today’s meetinga[CAB-21-MIN-0415 refers]. A set of public health controls were agreed to inprinciple, to mitigate the transmission risk associated with education servicesoresuming.r88 Cabinet also agreed that employees of education services (schools and earlylearning services), and workers who may have contact with children andPstudents when delivering an education service, will be required to receive theirfirst dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by 15 November 2021 and be fullyvaccinated by 1 January 2022. For Auckland and any other Alert Level 3areas, individual early learning and school staff will be required to be testedby 26 October before they physically return to work, and be tested weeklyuntil they are fully vaccinated [CAB-21-MIN-0414 refers].89 It was further agreed by Cabinet that education services will be required tomaintain an up-to-date register of the vaccination status of all staff and, for16SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VEsecondary schools, eligible students (fully, partially, exempt or no informationprovided) to be sought once schools restart [CAB-21-MIN-0414 refers].90 Over the last two weeks, the Ministries of Health and Education have workedtogether to refine public health measures that would need to be in place whenchildren and young people return to school and early learning services. Most dof these measures are already included in Alert Level 3 guidance, includingrecommending that children, young people and staff at higher risk of seveereillness from COVID-19 should stay at home, unless fully vaccinated;mandatory face coverings for staff and learners in years 9 to 13; and recordskeeping for contact tracing purposes. At last week’s Cabinet meeting, weagreed to additional measures including mandatory face coverings on schoolatransport, maximising time and activities outside, and physical distancing forexams [CAB-21-MIN-0415 refers].eInterim public health advice about reopening Auckland schools and early learninglservices further e91 The interim public health advice is to defer allowing all children and youngRpeople to return to education services (schools and early learning services)until after Tuesday 26 October 2021, based on the:91.1 case profile in Auckland and the upward trajectory of cases;y91.2 increased risk of transmission that may result from reopeningeducation services prlimarily due to the related increased movementacross the city; ande91.3 deferred effecvtiveness of vaccines for at least two weeks after a personreceived their second dose.itReopening considerations and optionsc92 The decision about whether to allow all children and young people to return toschoaol and early learning services is a finely balanced one requiring difficulttrade-offs between improving education outcomes and increasing potentialhealth risks for children and young people. For many parents, there is also aosignificantconcern about children and young people transmitting COVID-19 tomore vulnerable members of their whānau, particularly older people or thoserwithco-morbidities.P93The reopening decision is made more difficult because there are nograduated options to enable more children and young people to go back toschool. Education sector stakeholders have provided very strong feedbackthat they cannot successfully manage to deliver both onsite face-to-face anddistance learning at the same time, without compromising education quality.Bubbles and 1 metre physical distancing cannot be accommodated if allchildren and young people return to school.94 The decision to maintain distance learning for children and young people willhave a disproportionately negative impact on Māori, Pacific, and disabled17SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VElearners, and learners from disadvantaged backgrounds. It will also be moredifficult for learners in years 11 to 13 who will be sitting exams.95 Given that young people over the age of 12 are eligible for vaccination manyhave been partially or fully vaccinated in Auckland (85 percent first dose and57 percent second dose for ages 12 to 19 years, as at 17 October 2021), I dwould like us to consider whether the education outcomes outweigh thepotential risk of additional transmission for years 9 to 13. There are two eoptions we could consider:s95.1 allowing all young people in years 9 to 13 to return to school for face-to-face onsite teaching from 26 October; ora95.2 only allowing young people in years 11 to 13 to return to school forface-to-face onsite teaching from 26 October. e96 The first option would be easier for schools to operaltionalise as the deliveryfocus will be onsite teaching for all years. The seceond option would ensurethat young people with critical assessments this term are able to receive face-to-face learning onsite, and would reduce thRe proportion of young peopletravelling to school. However, schools have advised officials they are unlikelyto be able to operate on-site for some year groups while maintaining viabledistance learning for other groups. T he Ministry of Education will continue towork with schools to encourage aynd enable this, but the second option maymean some students in years 9 to 10 may be without viable learning optionsfor an extended period. In eilther option, schools expect that a proportion oflearners will not return to sechool for onsite learning even if they are able todue to fear of increased exposure to COVID-19 for the learners and theirwhānau. v97 Alternatively, in light of the interim public advice, we could defer reopening ofiall schools antd early learning services for all children until 1 November,subject to updated public health risk advice on Thursday 21 October. This iscthe cautious approach, acknowledging the increased opportunities fortransamission and household links associated with any broader resumption ofeducation services in Auckland.o98 I will report back to Cabinet with more detail about operationalisingprogressive options to allow more children and young people to attend onsiterreopeneducation services (early childhood and schools) in Auckland,P following engagement with education sector leaders. on Tuesday 26 October.The scope of this advice will depend on today’s decisions about years 9-13.99 When Auckland schools and early learning services reopen, consistent withpublic health advice, I propose that Out of School Care and Recreation(OSCAR) programmes are also permitted to open to support parents beingable to return to work. Resuming these programmes comes with risk(particularly due to increased intermingling of students from more than oneschool), so I propose extending the vaccination and testing requirements(outlined in paragraph 87), and public health controls (referred to in paragraph86), to employees in OSCAR programmes.

Asnoted above it also decided to mandate vaccination of education wosrkers.These mandates are to be put in place through an amendment to the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations) Order 2021 (the VacacinationsOrder) [CAB-21-MIN-0413 and CAB-21-MIN-0414 refer].e101 I consider that workers in prisons also provide services in a high-risk settingand this group should also be added to the Vaccinations Order and theladdition of this group should be progressed in conjunction with the healtheworkforce group.R102 The addition of work in prisons fits well with the health workforce changesbecause roles within prisons can require frequent contact with those providinghealth services – e.g. Corrections Officers working in Intervention and SupportUnits or escorting prisoners to and from the health centre in a prison.y103 Healthcare services in prison are also not limited to a single site within alprison such as the health centre. For example, healthcare services can beeprovided in other units such as high dependency units and Intervention andSupport Units, non-healthcare staff can be required to attend emergenciesvand provide medication in mainstream units, and health services such aspsychological treatment are provided in different locations throughout aiprison.tcPrisons are high-risk environments for the transmission of COVID-19a104 Mandating vaccination for work that takes place in prisons is an importantstep to protect the health of workers and people in prison. People in prisonoare some of the most vulnerable to COVID-19, due to the ease oftransmission that COVID-19 can have in prisons, and the existing healthrvulnerabilities of the prison population.P105A risk assessment completed by Corrections found that all areas of prisonenvironments and work undertaken within them should be considered “veryhigh” risk. Existing controls such as the use of PPE will not reduce the risksufficiently and vaccinations are a critical tool reducing the risk of COVID-19outbreaks in prison and justify any limitation there is on rights under the Bill ofRights Act (discussed below in paragraphs 119 to 124).106 Including work that takes place in prisons in the scope of the COVID-19 PublicHealth Response (Vaccinations) Order 2021 (the Vaccinations Order) is19SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33SEN SIT I VEconsistent with the intent of the Order to prevent harm from COVID-19 in high-risk settings.Proposal to amend the Vaccinations Order to require prison workers to bevaccinatedd107 I am seeking Cabinet’s approval to amend the Vaccinations Order to requireworkers who perform work in prisons to be vaccinated. e108 Specifically, I recommend Cabinet agree:s108.1 All roles that provide work or services for the Department ofaCorrections, and that require the worker carrying out that role to usuallyor regularly be admitted entry into a prison, should be included in theeVaccinations Order amendment alongside the inclusion of the healthand disability workforce-related changes.l108.2 This scope does not apply to anyone who ies visiting a prisoner, asopposed to visiting a prison for the purpose of conducting work.

These roles are also lessrlikely to come into frequent or close contact with healthcare staff.P110For these roles that are excluded from the scope of the Order, otheroperational mitigations will be taken to minimise the risk of COVID-19transmission in a prison, such as requiring people to wear PPE, physicallydistance, and have their temperature tested before entering a prison.This Order will apply to approximately 6,000 people111 The scope of the proposed amendment to the Vaccination Order will apply toroughly 840 healthcare staff (including doctors, nurses, and psychologists)and 5,500 other staff who are essential workers in prisons and who have20SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-10-22 09:07:33desaeleRylevitcaorPSEN SIT I VE116 As at Wednesday 13 October, the balance of the COVID-19 Response andRecovery Fund was $10.7 billion.Resurgence Support Payment August 2021117 A third round of RSP was opened on 8 October.

Our approach to controlling COVID-19 hasbeen based on tight border controls, an effective testing, contact tracing andYisolation system, and a well-accepted and coherent Alert Levels system forwhen community cases emerge.L4 As we reach high levels of domestic vaccination, we are now approaching aEpoint where the current strategy needs to change. There have been significantimpacts on people who have been separated by the border measures andVdomestic restrictions, including less contact with their families. Manybusinesses have experienced the negative effects of lockdowns andIdisconnection with the rest of the world. We have also learned from overseasTthat extended lockdowns, particularly in response to delta, lose their utility asa measure for controlling spread.C5 To support the next steps in our reconnection with the world, I am proposingto shAift the focus of our response from elimination to an approach based onminimisation and protection. The central element to this shift is the newCOVID-19 Protection Framework, which lays out our domestic responseOmeasuresfor a highly vaccinated population, without a reliance on lockdowns.Refreshing the domestic response framework marks a step-change in ourRresponse, and gives a clear signal to the public of the strategy reset.6 Minimisation means that we are aiming to keep the spread of COVID-19 at asPlow a level as possible. It means containing and controlling any outbreaks,and if practical to do so, stamping them out. It also means that there will morethan likely be some level of cases in the community on an ongoing basis.Protection means that we will protect people from the virus, with vaccination,management, and a response that focusses on minimising the significanthealth impacts of the virus.11chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVENew Framework7 Central to the new approach is the new framework. The COVID-19 ProtectionFramework that I have previously proposed to Cabinet features three levelsdesigned to control the spread in different circumstances. The goals of the Dframework that Cabinet previously agreed are based on vaccination, effectivetesting and isolation, and control of transmission.E8 Importantly, at all levels of the new framework, most businesses andSeducation entities can remain open on-site with mitigations in place, andpeople are not required to stay home, unless required to isolate. TheAframework also leverages the protections of vaccination by affording peoplegreater freedoms when they are fully vaccinated. I also expect the ability forvaccinated people to visibly enjoy greater freedoms will be a sEtrong spur forthe indifferent or hesitant to get vaccinated.L9 How the framework is used forms the basis of our new approach. The focuswill be on protecting people and minimising health impacts by containing anyEcommunity outbreaks. The application of the new framework will be moretargeted than the current Alert Level framework. The levels in the frameworkRwill be able to be applied on a regional basis, and will depend on the levels ofvaccination, population at greater risk of health impacts, and health systemcapacities. There will also be more targeted measures within regions, such asYeffective isolation of cases and their contacts, and school or workplaceclosures, or localised restrictions to limit movement within high risk suburbs orLlocalities.E10 Initial modelling from Te Pūnaha Matatini (TPM) suggests that with 90% of theeligible population fully vaccinated, and few if any pockets of low vaccination,the Orange level wouldV significantly slow the spread of any outbreak, but theRed level would likely still need to be used to be confident that case numbersreduce over timeI. The higher the vaccination rate, the greater confidence weTcan have in the measures in this framework to contain any outbreak, but thereis a risk that we still need to use frequent or widespread local lockdownsCsimilar to Alert Level 3 to control it. This is consistent with the experiences ofcountries that have moved away from tight controls with high vaccinationrateAs.TransitionO11 I have previously outlined what the new framework looks like, and theR measures that would be used at each level. We have broad agreement atCabinet and with our key stakeholders that a new framework is bothP necessary and welcome.12 The critical questions now are when we can move, and how we plot a path tothe new approach. Vaccination and health system readiness are the criticalenablers of the new approach. In order to shift to the new approach, we needto have confidence that our health system is as ready as it can be in the timeavailable and that vaccination rates are high enough to enable a shift.21chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVE13 I am proposing to use targets as a signal that we will have the confidence totransition to the new framework (estimated times when targets will be met areprovided in brackets). I am proposing that Auckland be treated separatelyfrom the rest of the country, due to the outbreak and boundary controls. Thetransition in Auckland would be first to Red once each DHB in Auckland has Dreached 90% full vaccination of those eligible (late November – earlyDecember). For the rest of New Zealand, the transition would first be to EOrange, once 90% full vaccination of those eligible has been reached in eachDHB. Consideration will be given to whether the South Island could moveSearlier if each of its DHB reaches 90% before the rest of the country. If theSouth Island remains COVID-free, they could also possibly move into Green.AEach option will be considered closer to the time.14 In addition to considering the overall vaccination rates, we neeEd to haveconfidence that the distribution of vaccination will not leave pockets of thepopulation vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19. TargetLing high vaccinationrates across each DHB will support more equitable outcomes.E15 There is a risk that some communities do not reach the 90% targets thatwould signal we have confidence to move. If thRis occurs, we need to haveconfidence that if we do transition, the health system and public healthcontrols will succeed in keeping it out and stamping it out of thesecommunities.Y16 Some will think that 90% is insufficient. The National Iwi Chairs Forum haveLrecommended that 95% of eligible Māori are vaccinated before the transitionoccurs. Epidemiologists and public health experts consulted on the frameworkEconsidered that vulnerable groups may require 95% coverage. We need towork hard to ensure that that intensive efforts continue to lift vaccination ratesVfor Māori and vulnerable groups before and after we transition.Next steps and report bIacksT17 I will announce the new framework and approach, and the targets fortransition Con Friday 22 October.18 The Minister for COVID-19 Response will report back to Cabinet on 26AOctober with detailed decisions for the implementation of COVID-19Vaccination Certificates.O19 The Minister for Health will report back to Cabinet in November on the newtesting, tracing and isolation strategies.R20Officials will continue to work on our operational readiness for a switch to thenew approach and its implementation. They will work closely with Māori andPMāori Ministers in the development of operational detail, implementation andtransition plans. The Minister for COVID-19 Response will report back toCabinet on Monday 15 November with a progress update on transition plansfor Auckland and the rest of New Zealand. There will be a second fuller reportback on transition in late November or early December beforeimplementation. As we do not expect to be able to fully switch to the newframework until at least early December, I intend that we start to introduce31chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVEaspects such as new testing and isolation strategies, and COVID-19Vaccination Certificates to allow entry in certain settings.21 Treasury officials will continue to work on implementation of new economicsupports to fit with the new approach. The Minister of Finance has an oralDitem at today’s Cabinet to outline the broad proposed approach, includingwhat support may be needed during the transition period to the framework.EThe Minister will then report back to Cabinet in November with a newapproach to economic supports. The Minister for Social Development andSEmployment will report back to Cabinet in November with a revised approachto welfare and community-based supports, including food and other essentialAwellbeing provisions.Introduction E22 This paper describes the new framework and approach for managing COVID-L19 in New Zealand. There are three main parts:22.1 An introduction to the new approach; E22.2 The new COVID-19 Protection framework and how it will be used; andR22.3 A plan for how we transition to the new framework.23 Cabinet previously considered the framYework on 4 October [CAB-21-MIN-0406]. It has since been updated after consultation with key stakeholders andTreaty partners. We have also taLken into account feedback from the StrategicCOVID-19 Public Health Advisory Group and public health officials. It wasdiscussed with a forum of leEading epidemiologists and other scientists.Officials have also undertaken targeted consultation on the use of COVID-19Vaccination CertificateVs.A New ApproachIT24 I propose to shift our response strategy to one of Minimisation and Protection.Our elimination strategy was a successful approach for the first phases of theCpandemic, but to move forward with our approach to reconnecting with theworld with a highly vaccinated population, a new approach is required.A25 The goals of the new approach that we agreed on 4 October are to:O25.1Maximise vaccination – including ensuring good coverage acrossgeographic areas, age range, and ethnicity to prevent outbreaks,R25.2 Maintain effective testing, tracing and isolating of cases and contactswhen they do arise,P25.3 Control transmission of the virus through sustainable public healthmeasures,25.4 Give as much certainty and stability as possible for people, andbusinesses, including by removing the need for Alert Level 3 and 4lockdowns,41chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVE25.5 Catch cases at the border, but work towards removing the bottlenecks,and being more open,25.6 Ensure our hospitals and public health system are well equipped tocare for cases if and when they do arise,D25.7 Maintain equity in health and economic outcomes.E26 Minimisation means that we are aiming to keep the spread of COVID-19 at aslow of a level as possible. That means containing and controlling anySoutbreaks, and if practical to do so, stamping them out. There will likely besome level of cases in the community on an ongoing basis.A27 Protection means that we will protect people from the virus, with vaccination,treatment, and a response that focusses on minimising the sigEnificant healthimpacts of the virus. It also means that we will protect the health of all ourpeople, by ensuring that we are not letting cases go to thLe point where theimpacts have flow-on effects to other parts of the health system, impacting onother health priorities. E28 The Strategic COVID-19 Public Health Advisory Group led by Professor SirRDavid Skegg reviewed the new framework and recommended that any newapproach was based on “minimisation and protection”. Transition to a newapproach is supported by the Ministry of Health. However, they both note theYrisks involved in transitioning away from the elimination strategy. We need toensure the approach is supported by high vaccination rates, zero tolerance forLCOVID-19 in high risk and vulnerable settings, and locally eliminatingoutbreaks where it is still practicable to achieve.E29 The central element to this shift is the new COVID-19 Protection Framework,Vwhich lays out our domestic response measures for a highly vaccinatedpopulation. Refreshing the domestic response framework marks a step-Ichange in our response and gives a clear signal to the public of a strategyTreset. How we use the framework gives effect to the approach. While we willuse the Orange and Red levels to control and restrict spread, individual casesCwill not mean a national response.30 If weA are prepared to control COVID-19 within the border, managed by highvaccination levels and our new framework, then we can change our risktolerance at the border. We are making the first moves in that direction withOthedecisions we are also making today about restarting travel with parts ofAustralia and low risk Pacific countries. At Cabinet Business Committee on 1RNovember, the Minister for COVID-19 Response and I will report back on ourapproach for Reconnecting New Zealanders with the world. In that paper weP will give greater detail on the options for change at the border.Framework31 The new framework is the central piece to our new domestic strategy. It isdesigned to create more certainty and stability in our response. With highlevels of vaccination, the framework enables people to respond to COVID-19without the need to rely so much on lockdowns. Importantly, at all levels of the51chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVEnew framework, most businesses and education entities can remain open on-site, and they have certainty for what is required of them.32 The new framework features three levels, with:D32.1 Green aims to allow almost normal social and economic activity whilecontinuing to build health system capacity,E32.2 Orange aims to avoid exponential growth in cases with moderatepopulation level controls, andS32.3 Red aims to protect the sustainability of the health system and theAhealth of communities through population-level controls.33 We can still use localised lockdowns, with boundaries, where required toEprotect people’s health. We retain these powers under the COVID-19 PublicHealth Response Act 2020 (the Act). We also retain the power to put in placeLwider lockdowns, as for Alert Level 3 and 4, if pressure on the health systembecomes unmanageable, or if there are new variantEs that evade ourprotection from immunity. However, Police advises that compliance could notbe enforced through multiple checkpoints, due to the resource and operationalRchallenges with such a model.34 Within the framework we will also have r equirements for vaccination that willYallow greater freedoms for those who are fully vaccinated. While overall thelevels are pitched at around the same as Alert Levels 1, 2 and 2.5, for the fullyLvaccinated, the Orange level will feel more similar to Alert Level 1, and theRed level will feel closer to the Delta Alert Level 2.E35 On 4 October Cabinet agreed the draft framework for the purposes of furtherwork. I now propose toV agree this framework for the purposes of publicrelease. There have been changes to the framework since it was last seen byCabinet and an uIpdated version is in Appendix 1.T36 The changes that have been made since the framework was last agreed byCabinet aCre:36.1 Setting the finer detail of gathering and capacity limits for each level;A36.2 Setting the details of when and in what situations COVID-19Vaccination Certificates will be required;O36.3Strengthening the Red level to rein in spread and include greater clarityR on vaccination requirements.Vaccination RequirementsP37 The framework leverages the protections of vaccination by affording peoplegreater freedoms when they are fully vaccinated. This will reduce thelikelihood of ‘super-spreading’ situations resulting from attendance byunvaccinated and highly infectious people. I also expect the ability forvaccinated people to enjoy greater freedoms to be a strong spur for theindifferent or hesitant to get vaccinated.61chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVE38 The vaccination requirements will be different at each level in response to thelevel of risk involved. This has been supported by public health advice thatduring an outbreak, there are additional public health benefits for vaccinerequirements in high risk settings.1D39 On 4 October we agreed to the introduction of COVID-19 vaccinationcertificates (CVCs) in specific domestic settings. Following officials’ targetedEconsultation, I am now proposing the next level of detail for CVCs.40 At the Green level I propose mandating CVCs for very large high-risk eveSnts,where there are large numbers of people gathering together for an event, withattendees likely to disperse widely following the event, and where pAeople mayspend significant lengths of time together. This category would likely includeconcerts, festivals and large spectator sporting matches. E41 At the Orange level, I propose that vaccine requirements also be introduced inLhigh-risk indoor settings, particularly where other public health measures maybe challenging to follow or enforce, or do not allow a business to operate withEits full functions. These settings could include nightclubs, live music and somehospitality venues, where it might not be practical to wear a face covering atRall times, or to enforce social distancing requirements. Where there arecapacity limits for higher risk situations, I propose that these will not apply ifvaccination is a requirement of entry.Y42 At the Red level there will be both capacity limits and vaccinationrequirements for entry for customLers and staff.43 The introduction of vaccine requirements in certain discretionary settingsEshould not prevent unvaccinated people from accessing life-preservingservices. I propose prohibiting vaccine requirements and the use of CVCs inVlife-preserving and basic needs services. This category will includesupermarkets, pharmacies, health services and education entities (forIstudents), potentially aside from potentially tertiary education organisations.T(On 11 October Cabinet agreed to introduce vaccination and testingrequiremeCnts within the education system [CAB-21-MIN-0414].)44 Prohibiting the use of CVC in specific venues and settings would apply toAcustomers only, as in these settings it may still be reasonable to require staffto be vaccinated. Primary legislation is required to prohibit vaccineOrequirements for patrons. Officials are working together to ensure that a rangeof vaccine-related amendments can be progressed as quickly as possible.R45I propose that where there is a vaccine requirement for patrons, workersshould also be vaccinated to maintain the public health intention of theP measure. Further work on vaccination requirements for workers at very largehigh-risk settings and high-risk indoor settings will be progressed throughwork led by MBIE on a public health risk-based framework to set vaccinationand/or testing requirements for all work. The Minister for Workplace Relationsand Safety will bring a paper on this framework to Cabinet on 26 October.1 Public health advice on CVCs was provided in three joint Ministry of Health – DPMC briefings to theMinister for COVID-19 Response71chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVE46 Outside of these defined mandated and prohibited categories, the introductionof vaccine requirements and use of CVCs for patrons and staff will be optionalfor businesses and operators. I propose that government develop enablinglegislation as well as clear guidelines, and set expectations as to how CVCsshould be used in these optional settings. This guidance should also make the Dlegal position on vaccine requirements and CVC clear: that private bodies canlimit the general public from accessing their premises, as long as this does notEamount to unlawful discrimination. More certainty would be provided by a “forthe avoidance of doubt” provision (discussed below in the legislative Simplications section).A47 There will be a small number of people who are unable to be vaccinated, asthey have a clear contraindication to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. I proposethat these people would be exempt from vaccine requirementsE on medicalgrounds, as it is not reasonable to expect them to be vaccinated at this time.These people will be issued with a CVC. The Ministry of LHealth estimatesfewer than 200 people in New Zealand would fall into this category. It will alsobe important to ensure that offshore vaccinations caEn be recognised.48 I also intend to exempt children under 12 yearRs and 3 months from vaccinerequirements in the above settings. At present, the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccinehas been approved by Medsafe for use in people aged 12 and over. Theadditional three-month buffer will allow sufficient time for a person to beYvaccinated once they turn 12 and become eligible.L49 s9(2)(h)EVI50 The Minister foTr COVID-19 Response will report back to Cabinet on 26October with detailed settings for and decisions for the implementation ofCVCs inclCuding any primary legislation needed to enable CVCs to be used asanticipated.AUsing the frameworkO51 How the framework is implemented is as important as the content of theframework, as it gives effect to our domestic strategy. I propose that we use aR targeted approach that will give us the ability to contain and control outbreaks,while allowing wider personal freedoms and a return to more usual economicand social activity. As we shift from a national or regional approach to a morePtargeted approach there will also be a need for us to reconsider our welfareand community approaches.52 The new approach is more targeted. Different elements will apply at differentlevels of population coverage:52.1 the levels of the framework can be applied on a regional basis, and willdepend on the levels of vaccination, population at greater risk of health81chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVEimpacts, health system capacities, and connection to the border ineach region;52.2 localised lockdowns, similar to Alert Level 3 restrictions, would apply tosmaller areas or suburbs within regions where there are particular highDrates of spread, or spread within particularly vulnerable communities;52.3 temporary closures of or within individual workplaces or education Eentities, where the isolation or closure of a workforce or educationservice could interrupt the spread; and S52.4 isolation of individuals, who are positive cases or close contacts ofApositive cases, will remain central to our public health response.53 I propose Ministers agree to whether shifts in the framework leEvel overall andfor different regions in New Zealand are an appropriate public health responseat the time, in the same way that we consider shifts in aleLrt levels. Themeasures necessary to reflect shifts in the framework level would be made bythe Minister for COVID-19 Response through new oErders under the Act. Ipropose that in making decisions we replace the current five health-basedfactors used to inform Alert Level decisions wiRth the following:53.1 vaccination coverage across the overall population and equity ofvaccination coverage;Y53.2 the capacity of the health and disability system to manage COVID-19Lcases, including across public health, primary care, communityservices, and secondary care;E53.3 testing, contact tracing and case management capacity; andV53.4 the transmission of COVID-19 within the community, including itsimpact on key populations.IT54 I propose that we retain the other four factors previously agreed by Cabinet[CAB-20-MIN-0199; CAB-20-MIN-0387 refer]:C54.1 evidence of the effects of the measures on the economy and societyA more broadly;54.2 evidence of the impacts of the measures for at risk populations inOparticular;R 54.3 public attitudes towards the measures and the extent to which peopleand businesses understand, accept, and abide by them; andP54.4 our ability to operationalise the restrictions, including satisfactoryimplementation planning.55 These decisions will also be guided by indicative thresholds for changedeveloped by the Ministry of Health. These thresholds will be refined as welearn more through continued modelling and the implementation of ourapproach. The thresholds are:91chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVE55.1 Green; case numbers kept low through testing, contact tracing andquarantine and hospitalisations at a manageable level;55.2 a shift to Orange would occur with increasing community transmission,increasing pressure on the health system, or increasing risk to at riskDpopulations;55.3 a shift to Red would occur when cases are no longer contained to the Eoriginal outbreak areas, action is needed to protect the healthcaresystem, and the health of communities, or at risk populations. S56 I am also advised that the most appropriate application of any movementArestrictions to local areas within a region is through orders under the Act. Thislevel of decision would sit with the Minister for COVID-19 Response, and theEMinisters he is required to consult with under the Act.57 Temporary and targeted closures of schools or workplacLes, and isolationrequirements for individuals should remain with the Director General andMedical Officers of Health using Section 70 of the HEealth Act 1956. Thisallows for the fastest response in specific risk situations.RBoundaries58 In some cases, inter-regional boundaries will be needed to stop the spread ofYCOVID-19 into new regions. However, I do not think that boundaries need tobe more stringent than our borders. It is important that we have freedom ofLmovement within New Zealand and that we allow families to connect in theholiday season. I note however, that there will be significant operational detailEto consider when implementing boundaries. This detail will be presented toCabinet for decisions when we report back to Cabinet in November.V59 Anyone who is fully vaccinated and has evidence of a test taken up to 72hours before leavIing should be able to move out of a region in the Red levelTfor any reason (there may need to be some different evidentiary requirementsfor essential workers undertaking this type of travel to reflect operationalCpracticalities). I do not propose to have any requirements for people movinginto a Red level. There will not be boundaries or requirements for peoplemovAing between Orange levels, nor will there be boundaries between Orangeand Green levels. There may be tighter boundaries around localised lockdownOareas.60 Police advise that they could not resource checkpoints at multiple boundariesR across the country, due to resource and operational challenges. They do nothave enough staff to resource multiple checkpoints across various regions,P noting that crime demand is likely to return to normal levels and will haveongoing COVID-19 related enforcement responsibilities. Localised lockdownscould also be operationally challenging to enforce due to the number of roadsproviding multiple access points.Testing Tracing Isolation and Quarantine Strategy61 The maintenance of an effective test, trace, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ)system is critical to the new approach. Our experience to date, supported by101chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVEmodelling of future scenarios with a highly vaccinated population shows that awell functioning tracing and isolation system makes a significant difference tothe spread of COVID-19. The change to our approach both requires andenables adapting our current TTIQ system.D62 Vaccination will reduce both transmission of the virus and the likelihoodpeople will require hospital level care. Vaccinated people will still get infected,Ebut the vast majority will have mild or no symptoms, so a different approach isrequired to testing, isolation and contact tracing.S63 At the Green level, testing of symptomatic people will remain essential, andwill need to be complemented by wastewater testing and ongoing suArveillancetesting of asymptomatic people. Wider use of rapid antigen testing will supportthis. Vaccinated people who become infected will not need toE isolate for aslong if they are asymptomatic and isolation in a quarantine facility will only benecessary for some cases – based largely on their ability to isolate safely atLhome. Likewise, a different approach can be taken to managing contacts ofcases depending on their vaccination status, use ofE PPE and the nature of theexposure event.R64 An updated testing strategy is under development to support the futureframework that considers vaccination status of the population, which may varyby region. New contact tracing categorie s have been defined and areYcurrently being finalised to support the most effective use of the contacttracing system nationally. Finally, a model for home isolation is beingLfinalised, and is already being deployed in Auckland as case numbers riseand we use up all available space in MIQ facilities. The Minister for Health willEreport back to Cabinet in November on the new testing, tracing and isolationstrategies.VFlow-on impactsI65 The impact thaTt the new COVID-19 Protection framework will have oneconomic activity is highly uncertain and will depend on the detailed settings,related poClicy measures such as the use of CVCs, and behavioural changescompared to previous lockdowns. The Treasury will provide an estimate of theimpaAct of the new framework in the next COVID-19 Protection frameworkpaper in November.O66 The Treasury is providing advice to the Minister of Finance on how the systemof economic supports will need to change in response the new framework.R This includes advice on transitional support over the remainder of the year, aswell as what support may need to be provided in 2022, and any primarylegislation amendments needed to reflect the new framework in the economicPsupport legislation. It is likely that as vaccination rates increase and there isless need for more restrictive public health settings, there will be a reducedneed for broad-based economic supports.67 The Minister of Finance will report back to Cabinet in November withdecisions for a new approach to economic supports in line with the newstrategic approach.111chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVE68 The social impacts of the new COVID-19 Protection framework are alsouncertain. Targeted support for vulnerable communities will be required at theOrange and Red Levels alongside a welfare response to support the care inthe community health model. The Minister for Social Development andemployment will report back to Cabinet in November with decisions for a Drevised approach to welfare and community-based supports, including foodand other essential wellbeing provisions. ETransitionSVaccination targetsA69 We have had broad agreement within Cabinet, with the stakeholders we haveengaged with through targeted consultation, and our Public HeEalth expertsthat a new strategy and domestic response framework is required as we shiftto a high vaccination world. L70 The critical questions now are when we can move, and how we plot a path toEthe new approach. Vaccination is the critical enabler of the new approach. Inorder to shift to the new approach, we need to have confidence thatRvaccination rates are high enough to enable a shift.71 I propose we select targets to signal whe n we will have the confidence totransition to the new framework. We nYeed to have high overall vaccinationcoverage and confidence in the distribution across communities. We alsoneed to take account of the curreLnt outbreak in Auckland. We are at a criticaljuncture in managing this outbreak, while we are still getting new cases, butacceptance of strict controlsE is wearing thin. I consider that Auckland will needto transition to the new approach as soon as it is ready so we maintain oursocial license, but I noVte that we will need to consider the public health risk inthe situation at the time.I72 Greater granulTarity in the threshold we set will provide us with moreconfidence about the distribution of vaccine coverage but meeting such athreshold Cmay delay transition to the new framework – perhaps for months.73 I recommend the following targets, to ensure that we are ready to shift inAAuckland, and that we do not leave particularly vulnerable communitiesexposed. Estimates of when we may achieve each target are provided as aOguide to decision making although it should be noted that forward projection ofvaccination rates is highly uncertain.R73.1 In each DHB in Auckland - 90% full vaccination of those eligible (lateNovember – early December)2;P73.2 In each DHB outside Auckland - 90% full vaccination of those eligible(January).74 I propose that we treat Auckland separately from the rest of New Zealand andit could move to the new framework. Running two frameworks simultaneouslyis likely to have operational and legal challenges. I propose that we agree2 A range is provided due to the uncertainty of projections of this nature.121chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVEthese targets today in principle, subject to further advice to Ministers withPower to Act on those challenges.75 Reaching the 90% of eligible population target will mean roughly 76% of NewZealand's total population is vaccinated. On current vaccination rates, thisDwould put us among the group of developed countries with the highest rates.This demonstrates that this is a target that is achievable, but one that willErequire us to do better than most countries we compare ourselves with.76 We would expect that most DHBs individually will be over 80% full vaccinSationby early December, but there will be targeted efforts needed to liftperformance in the few that are not on track. A77 At this stage I expect that Auckland would transition at the Red level of theEframework, and the rest of New Zealand where COVID-19 is not presentwould transition at the Orange level. I expect that the South Island with aL90%+ vaccination rate across the population and no cases of COVID-19present could then shift to the Green level.E78 It is also important that we do not stop at 90% and focus only on the targets.There is no reason why our targets for transitioRn should be our overall targetsfor these populations. We will not lose sight of the groups that do not fit intoour targets; and achieving 90% in our ta rget groups will also allow us torefocus efforts into younger age groupYs and wider geographic areas.79 If 5-11 year olds are approved for vaccination before the targets are reached,Lthey will not be added to the eligible population. Being able to vaccinate under12s will be additional to the effectiveness of vaccinating 90% of 12 and overs,Ebecause it means a greater proportion of the total population will bevaccinated. Modelling by TPM suggests that vaccinating 85% of theVpopulation aged five and over would be more effective than 90% of over 12s.IHealth system readinessT80 The Ministry of Health has established a major health system readinessCprogramme which aims to prepare ourselves for the increase inhospitalisation, and less severe cases in primary and community settings thatwe eAxpect given the current case rate and the move to the new COVID-19Protection framework.O81 The key elements of this programme, which will be reported on separately,include workforce capacity and innovation, testing and surveillance, hospitalR readiness, capacity, facility and equipment supply, data and digital, equitychallenges, primary and community level models of care for the managementP of COVID-19, and equitable distribution of resources across communities andregions. The Minister of Health will continue to work with the Minister forCOVID-19 and report to Cabinet and Reconnecting Ministers on this work.131chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVERisksTransition to the Framework82 The framework and new approach has been developed at pace, out ofnecessity, in response to the evolving situation in Auckland. The work on the DAuckland outbreak has also meant that key resources have been stretched.E83 In particular, modelling resources have been focussed on ensuring we havehigh quality information on the Auckland outbreak. There is a risk that whenSmodelling is complete it paints a different picture of how the framework willwork. While modelling will be complete before implementation, significantAchanges to our approach after the announcement risks confusion and loss orsocial license.E84 There is a risk that not all groups within DHBs will reach a 90% vaccinationrate. Currently, vaccination rates for younger Māori and PLacific people aresignificantly lower than other ethnic groups. While we are using thevaccination rates as a signal of readiness, it may beE possible to transition tothe new framework if we are confident that the framework can beimplemented in a way that protects the vulneraRble in those areas. This wouldmean using the higher levels of the framework more readily, and frequent useof other public health measures.Y85 The National Iwi Chairs Forum have recommended that 95% of eligible Māoriare vaccinated before the transition occurs. This recommendation is made outLof a significant concern that Māori, and particularly younger Māori, will sufferthe worst impacts from spread of COVID-19. They also see significant risk forEMāori with low vaccination rates. We need to work hard to ensure thatintensive efforts continue to lift Māori vaccination rates before and after weVtransition.86 Epidemiologists aInd public health experts consulted on the framework weresceptical abouTt it and our readiness to move into it in the near term, especiallygiven the growing outbreak in Auckland and increasing, but still insufficient,Cvaccination levels amongst most population groups. The group consultedwere unanimous that the shift to the framework should not take place until wereacAh at least 90% immunity, including of vulnerable groups who may require95% of the over 12s as a minimum.OUse of the FrameworkR87 The intent of the new framework is that we give the public greater certaintyand stability by avoiding the use of Alert Level 3 and 4. However, there arestill situations that may call for their use. In the case that hospitalisations putPthe wider healthcare system under too much strain, or that there is a rise of anew variant that can evade our immunity, we will maintain the use of AlertLevel 3 or 4 lockdowns. We know from international experiences that we mayneed tight controls to avoid rapid spread in some cases, and I expect thatlocalised lockdowns will help us to avoid these scenarios developing.88 There will also be a risk that we use local lockdowns more than we initiallyenvisage. This could result in significant disparity between different parts of141chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVEcities or within regions. In particular, due to the disparity of vaccination anddynamics of spread, there is a risk of significant restrictions on areas of lowsocio-economic status, high housing density, and large Māori populations thatare not seen in other areas. This may, however, be necessary for the healthof people living in those areas. D89 The reality is that we will learn more as we transition. This occurred with theEAlert Level framework. How the framework has been deployed has changedas our response evolved, and it changed again as we responded to Delta.SThe settings within the Alert Levels were also adjusted as we learned moreabout what did and did not work in our approach. While we have the benefit ofAcarrying over the lessons learned from the Alert Level framework, I expectthat this new framework will evolve over time.ECommunicationsL90 Changing the approach also risks losing coherence in our communicationswith the public. There is a lot of public pride, trust and understanding of theEcurrent framework, but there is some recognition that the current alert levelsare no longer fit for purpose. The use of colours helps draws a line in the sandRbetween the old and the new framework and descriptions provide clarity onthe action required. We need to mitigate pandemic fatigue by ensuring wehave a clear, consistent, simple plan for the future that takes the public withYus and supports high levels of voluntary compliance.91 When introducing this change, wLe need to be clear about why this is needed,what is the change and why we are doing this now. The new approach willElook different for different people, we need to ensure we do not alienate anygroup or create a harmful division between vaccinated and those not yetvaccinated. People waVnt clarity on the rules, reassurance they will be safe,and direction so it is easy to understand what they need to do. The newapproach needs Ito show that people will continue to be protected, ourTeconomy wlll keep moving, and help us to get on with our plan to reconnectNew Zealanders to the world.CNext stepsA92 I will announce the new framework and approach, and the targets fortransition on Friday 22 October.O93 The Minister for COVID-19 Response will report back to Cabinet on 26October with detailed decisions for vaccine entry requirements and theRimplementation of COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates, including whereprimary legislation will be needed.P94 The Minister for Health will report back to Cabinet in November on the newtesting, tracing and isolation strategies.Implementation95 There is significant operational detail in the implementation of the new rulesand capacity settings for the new framework. As much as possible, officialswill use the operational implementation detail for Alert Level settings.151chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVEHowever, at the time of announcement there will be many details we have notworked through, particularly at the guidance level. On 4 October we directedofficials to prepare a process for businesses and groups to bring attention tosubstantive implementation issues. Identifying and working through theseissues will be a priority during the transition period D96 Operational planning for implementation will include plans for implementingEboundaries, including the logistical approach to the transaction of the requiredinformation at or before the boundary.S97 The Minister for COVID-19 Response will report back to Cabinet withtransition plans for Auckland and the rest of New Zealand that will inAclude:97.1 The approach to boundaries, and proposed operational detail to enableEfully vaccinated people to cross the boundary, if they have a test,97.2 A detailed approach to how localised lockdowns wLould be instigatedand implemented,E97.3 The tie-in between the transition to the new approach and summeroperational plans,R97.4 Further modelling to inform the thresholds for movement betweenlevels of the framework and expe cted timing for transition.Y98 The Minister will initially report back with a progress report on transitionplanning on Monday 15 NovembLer and then with a full plan in late Novemberor early December before implementation.E99 My expectation is that officials will work closely with Māori and Māori Ministersin the development of operational detail, implementation and transition plans. IValso expect that there will be more resources to support the increases invaccination rates among Māori and other vulnerable groups in order to reachIour targets.T100 Officials will prepare collateral to assist people, businesses and otherCcommunity groups with the transition to the new framework, which will helpthem to understand what is required of them at each step.A101 Officials will also develop a revised approach to welfare and community-based supports to tie in with the new framework, particularly at the OrangeOandRed levels, including food and other essential wellbeing provisions.RFinancial Implications102 Any funding implications for the Crown to implement these changes will bePconsidered in follow-up papers in November. There will be complianceimpacts for businesses and services in adapting guidance to the newframework.Legislative Implications103 As discussed above, new orders will be made under the Act by the Ministerfor COVID-19 Response to bring in the new framework.161chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVE104 With regard to vaccination requirements on entry, it would be possible tointroduce such requirements through secondary legislation, as suchrequirements are within the scope of powers provided to the Minister forCOVID-19 Response under the Act, so long as the measures are consistentwith the NZBORA. D105 s9(2)(h)ESAE106 s9(2)(h) LER107 Officials are doing further work to understand any legislative requirements toenable the use of CVCs themselves, to e nsure that the Ministry of HealthYCVC is the only acceptable tool in the settings where CVCs are mandated.108 Officials will report back to MinistLers in early November on the details andtimetable for legislative amendments related to the framework.EImpact AnalysisV109 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) Team has determined thatthe proposals in this Cabinet paper relating to COVID-19 VaccinationICertificates for domestic use are exempt from the requirement to provide aTRegulatory Impact Statement (RIS) on the grounds that they are intended tomanage, mitigate or alleviate the short-term impacts of a declared emergencyCevent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implementation of the policy isrequired urgently to be effective (making a complete, robust and timely RISAunfeasible).110 Given the significance of the potential impacts of this proposal, the RIA TeamOstronglysupports the review to be carried out in early 2022, which shouldassess wider impacts and policy lessons, including any equity concerns.RHumanRightsP111 s9(2)(h)112 s9(2)(h)171chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVEs9(2)(h)DE113 s9(2)(h)SAELEPopulation and economic impactsR114 There are two main population impacts from changes to the approach formanaging COVID-19:114.1 Health impacts, if changes meaYn more spread of COVID-19 in thecommunity – even if tightly managed, andL114.2 Impacts from the measures used to suppress cases.EHealth Impacts115 It is possible that a chaVnge in strategy will result in health impacts as COVID-19 circulates within New Zealand. However, it is also unclear that the healthimpacts are avoidIable under the current approach. We are relying onTvaccination to reduce these impacts as much as possible, but there will still beimpacts on those unvaccinated, and in some cases on those who areCvaccinated. It is also possible that the health impacts of COVID-19 will haveflow on effects into other areas of health, for example, significant numbers ofpeoAple with COVID-19 seeking care could reduce the health system’scapacity to deal with other health issues, for example urgent and elective careOfor other conditions.116 We know that the virus has had a disproportionate health impact on Māori andR Pacific communities. Pacific people have made up over 60% of the cases inthe main outbreaks, and Māori have the highest mortality rate. We need toP ensure that the next phase of our approach does not exacerbate theseinequities.117 Māori and Pacific people generally have higher rates of co-morbidities thatresult in poorer outcomes if they are infected with the virus. They also havemore risk due to proximity to the border, employment in essential workerroles, compromised resilience due to economic and social hardships,potentially greater impact of missing out on education due to digital divide,and barriers to accessing healthcare even though they have higher rates of181chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVElong term conditions. As age is a very strong risk factor for COVID-19,focusing our efforts on vaccinating people over 40 across all ethnic groupsbefore we transition will mitigate some of the worst health impacts, and thevaccination drive should not stop at 90%. It is possible though that withoutfurther granular understanding of vaccination rates there will be pockets of the Dpopulation vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19.E118 Older people are most at risk of hospitalisation and death with COVID-19 andthere will be health impacts in this group, even with high rates of vaccination.SIn people aged below 12 who cannot be vaccinated yet there is also some riskof impact, and this age group is generally exempt from mask usage. ThisAcould mean greater health impacts, and/or require more disruptive measuressuch as closing education entities and isolation to protect them from infection.E119 Even at high vaccination rates across a region there could be some sub-population groups, such as rural towns or areas within a DHB that have lowLvaccination rates. These groups will have to be considered when makingdecisions on levels and public health measures oncEe the new framework isintroduced, including whether any additional welfare, psychosocial andcommunity-based supports may be required toR mitigate prolonged impacts.120 Officials will develop a revised approach to welfare and community-basedsupports to tie in with the new framework , particularly at the Orange and RedYlevels, including food and other essential wellbeing provisions, in an effort toaddress some of these impacts.LImpacts from measuresE121 The principal impact from the change to the new framework is the introductionof measures that depeVnd on the vaccination status of an individual. This couldexacerbate existing inequities in the vaccination coverage among differentgroups. Māori, anId younger age groups of Pacific peoples currently have lowrates of vaccinTation compared with the wider population and could bedisproportionately impacted by the new framework. There could also beimpacts oCn disabled people who have had barriers to their access forvaccination. However, the use of vaccine requirements in some places couldhaveA the effect of increasing vaccination rates as people have furtherincentive to be vaccinated.O122 Feedback from the targeted engagement with the Iwi Chairs Forum focussedon the importance of vaccination for Māori. The Iwi chairs were keen toR ensure that changes to the framework would not disproportionately affectMāori and were clear that the key to that is lifting vaccination rates for Māori.PEconomic impacts123 As noted above, the impact that the new COVID-19 Protection framework willhave on economic activity is highly uncertain, and Treasury will provide anestimate of the impact of the new framework in the next paper in November.124 The Treasury’s initial high-level assessment, based on an earlier version ofthe COVID-19 Protection framework, is that the “Orange” setting would besimilar to a restrictive version of the current Alert Level 1, and that the “Red”191chtypxg3n 2021-11-25 16:49:35SENSITIVEsetting would be similar to the previous Delta Alert Level 2. Under theseassumptions, Treasury’s high-level estimate of the impact that the “Orange”alert level settings would have on economic activity is around $30 million perweek (slightly under 1% of GDP) relative to the “Green” level of public healthmeasures, while the “Red” settings is estimated to reduce economic activity Dby around $80 million per week (slightly over 1% of GDP). This estimate forthe “Red” settings is likely to be a lower bound, given the restrictions at this Elevel have been strengthened and the possibility of targeted lockdowns forfacilities or geographic regions. Losses are expected to be concentrated Sin theretail, accommodation, food services and other services industries.AConsultation E125 This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group in the Department of theLPrime Minister and Cabinet. The Ministry of Health reviewed the paper andprovided specific input, including public health advice and the views andErecommendations of the Director-General. Crown Law advised on the Bill ofRights implications.R126 The following agencies were also consulted on the paper: Customs,Departments of Internal Affairs, Correctio ns, Ministries of Education, EthnicCommunities, Housing and Urban DevYelopment, Culture and Heritage, SocialDevelopment, Justice, Primary Industries, Business, Innovation andEmployment, Transport, Pacific PLeoples, Te Arawhiti, the Treasury, Te PunaKokiri and the Public Service Commission.E127 The Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the office of the GovernmentChief Digital Officer were consulted in the development of the policy work onVCOVID-19 vaccination certificates.I128 Relevant Ministers have led engagement with targeted discussions with ourTTreaty partners, the health and disability sector, supermarkets and retail,hospitality and events, sports, places of worship, education entities, unionsCand workplaces. Officials also undertook targeted consultation on the use ofCVCs.A129 Feedback from these sectors has been incorporated into this paper and therevised framework. On the whole feedback was positive about the intent ofOthenew framework. Those consulted agreed that a new approach thatincorporated a high vaccination rate and aimed to minimise lockdowns wasRneeded. The concerns of the Iwi Chairs Forum and science leaders, includingthe need for higher thresholds for moving to the new framework, were notedP above.130 We also received feedback from sectors on more detailed elements of thenew framework and CVCs.

On Monday 18 October 2021 Cabinet considered a draft COVID-19 Protection Framework Efor New Zealand’s domestic response to COVID-19. Cabinet noted that officials wouldcontinue to finalise the detailed settings of the framework for implementation and COVSID-19 Ministers were authorised to have Power to Act to approve any final changes and editsto the framework [CAB-21-MIN-0421 refers].A2. Ministers have subsequently met to discuss the settings in the framework. Feedback wasprovided to officials, which has been incorporated, as set out in AttachmeEnt A.3. The most significant changes are: L• Greater use of COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates at GreeEn (extending them beyondhigh risk event facilities and gatherings as agreed by Cabinet on Monday to hospitality,close proximity businesses, and gyms);R• Closing some settings at Orange to unvaccinated people (e.g. events, close proximitybusinesses and services, and gyms); andY• Permitting tertiary education organisations to open at Red with a vaccinationrequirement for on-site delivery and Lother public health controls including capacitylimits.E4. Advice from the Ministry of Health supports vaccination requirements at Green given theongoing risk of COVID-19 in the community and the potential for a vaccinated person,Vwho is infected at an event, to transmit the virus to non-vaccinated community membersoutside that environment.IT5. Your approval of the attached framework is required to support the Prime Minister’s publicannouncement of the framework and strategy on Friday 22 October.CCOVID-19 Protection Framework settings will continue to evolveA6. The COVID-19 Protection Framework settings are deliberately high-level to enable furtherrefinement. There are details still to be worked through such as how to treat differentOoutdoor events and activities such as community sport, faith-based gatherings and eventssuch as school fairs and protests. Following Friday’s announcement, officials will continueR to work through this detail and provide further advice to Ministers as required. The settingswill also be underpinned by detailed guidance to be developed by sector agencies andapproved by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.P7. Following the framework coming into effect, the settings will continue to be iterated toreflect the changing COVID-19 risk in New Zealand. This is the approach taken to AlertLevel settings; and will help ensure the settings remain fit for purpose, coherent as awhole, and achieve the strategic goals of minimisation and protection. As signalled toCabinet on Monday 4 October, the Government should move cautiously when makingCOVID-19 PROTECTION FRAMEWORK SETTINGS DPMC-2021/22-621DPMC: 4448374:1 Page 5 of 8SENSITIVESENSITIVEfuture changes to the framework informed by lessons learned from our first steps and frominternational counterparts who have begun this transition.8. Officials will review the vaccination certification settings in early 2022. This review will helpto ensure the restrictions are fit for purpose and proportionate to the level of transmissionDrisk present in the community at that time. The efficacy of these restrictions, and theframework as a whole, will depend on vaccination rates.ENext StepsS9. Pending decisions on this briefing, the detailed settings within the framework atAttachment A will be used to inform Friday’s announcement of this framewAork andstrategy.E10. We understand that you have confirmed the vaccination targets that were agreed inprinciple at Cabinet on Monday ie 90% in each DHB in Auckland before Auckland movesto the new framework, and 90% in each DHB outside Auckland bLefore the rest of thecountry moves. We propose that the targets be reviewed by Cabinet on Monday 29November (at the same time as officials expect to report on reEadiness for implementationof the new framework in Auckland).RConsultation11.

EAlignment with Government PrioritiesL2 This proposal relates to the ongoing response to COVID-19. It strengthensEdomestic measures for access to discretionary activities and settings, in lightof the risks posed by more transmissible variants such as Delta.RExecutive Summary3 This paper outlines advice relating to tYhe operational consideration for the useof CVCs in various settings, specifically addressing:L3.1 exemptions from vaccine requirements in CVC settings;E3.2 implementation and operationalising CVCs; and3.3 compliance andV enforcement considerations.4 The proposals previously agreed by Cabinet on Monday 18 October wereIsubject to further consideration by Ministers, specifically relating to theirTapplication in the COVID-19 Protection Framework. On Thursday 21 Octoberdelegated Ministers approved the final settings about where a vaccineCrequirement could be introduced.A5 I propose that further work must also be undertaken (where not in trainalready) to:O5.1develop industry specific guidance to support businesses and otherparties to enable, appropriately limit, and implement a vaccinationRrequirement if they choose to put one in place;P 5.2 confirm the extent to which CVCs would be prohibited in teaching andtransport settings (e.g. school transport services), and5.3 identify how CVCs apply to government services that are provided tomembers of the public.6 Proposals on worker vaccination in certain settings and to undertake certaintypes of work have been prepared by MBIE and are being presented toCabinet separately.1I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V E7 Given the potential for vaccination rates and the risk of communitytransmission to change over time, I propose that the policy is reviewed inearly 2022. A review would recognise that CVCs are considered as atemporary measure. It would also provide an opportunity to monitor theeffectiveness and wider impacts of the policy, as well as assess whether any Dequity concerns related to the use of CVCs have eventuated.EBackgroundS8 COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates (CVCs) have been identified as a tool tohelp support the broader public health response to COVID-19. CVCs can alsoAbe used as an additional measure to ensure people in certain settings candemonstrate that they are either fully vaccinated, or medically exempt fromvaccination, with the exception of children under 12 years andE 3 months, asCVC requirements do not apply to them.L9 On Monday 18 October, Cabinet considered high level advice relating to theuse of CVCs in domestic settings, noting broad cateEgories to define settingsfor the application of vaccine requirements, and agreeing high level settings inwhich to mandate a required use of CVCs [CARB-21-MIN-0421]. Cabinet alsoagreed to issue drafting instructions to support the introduction of CVCs andto prohibit their use in certain settings.Y10 Delegated Ministers agreed the final settings for the introduction of CVCs aspart of a revised COVID-19 Protection Framework on 21 October. FurtherLdetail setting out final decisions on the application of vaccine requirementswhere they are expected to be used can be found in Appendix 1.E11 The settings where CVCs are expected to be used were announced publiclyVon 22 October.I12 The Ministry of Health has provided public health advice on the introductionTand application of CVCs in four briefings to the Minister for COVID-19Response, including on the effectiveness of CVC as a tool to help manageCCOVID-19.AProposed application for COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates13 This paper includes implementation proposals for the use of CVCs, to supportOthetransition to the COVID-19 Protection Framework. Some of theseproposals, and those agreed to by Cabinet on 18 October, requireRamendments to the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 (the Act).P 14 The Act was initially developed with the purpose to prevent the risk of anoutbreak or spread of COVID-19. While this is still our intention, theemergence of new variants and higher vaccination rates mean we haveshifted our approach to focus on avoiding and mitigating potential adverseeffects of COVID-19 itself. I propose that purposes for which orders under theCOVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 (the Act) can be made bebroadened, to better reflect the new measures and intentions under theCOVID-19 Protection Framework.2I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V ESettings where vaccine requirements will be prohibited15 Cabinet agreed that that providers of life-preserving basic needs cannotintroduce vaccine requirements (including by requiring CVCs) for patrons[CAB-21-MIN-0421], to ensure that unvaccinated people are not preventedDfrom accessing basic services.E16 An initial proposed list of settings where patrons cannot be required to presenta CVC to enter includes (but is not limited to):S16.1 supermarkets;A16.2 pharmacies;E16.3 education entities - in teaching settings and for students only (exceptwhen part of the management of a case or outbreak connected with orLin the facility);E16.4 health providers; andR16.5 public transport (excluding airline services).17 I propose that these services are also no t able to limit the type of serviceprovided to customers/patrons based Yon a CVC. However, businesses andservices may want to implement other reasonable health and safety policiesto enable safe operations. L18 I propose that the primary leEgislation to support these decisions is developedto give power to the Minister for COVID-19 Response to prohibit settings forvaccine requirements Vand CVC use through an Order.19 Given that prohibIiting the use of CVC in specific venues and settings wouldapply to customTers and attendees only, workers would be subject to anyapplicable vaccine requirements to undertake work in certain settings,including Cthose where CVCs are not permitted for patrons.Interface between CVCs and workplacesA20 The Minister for Workplace Relations and Safety has brought a correspondingOpaperon the approach to vaccination requirements to Cabinet on 26 October.This covers whether we should mandate vaccination for work in settingsR where a CVC is required from customers, recognising that businesses andworkers need to be able to plan for this in advance. The alternative would beallowing employers and businesses the discretion to require vaccination ifPthey decide they want to operate, or if they want to operate without capacityand distancing limits.21 Below is a table which sets out the indicative interrelation between CVCs andworkplaces:Patron Worker3I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V EMandatedOptional (if chosen) MBIE risk assessmentDProhibited MBIE risk assessmentEExemptions from vaccine requirements S22 Decisions on an exemptions framework for CVC have already been made byACabinet, however I have provided more detail on the operational requirementsbehind the proposals presented on 18 October.EOperationalising exemptionsL23 Following advice from the Ministry of Health, I propose that due to the verysmall number of people expected to be legitimately Eexempt, an alternativemeasure, such as a negative PCR test, is not recommended. There are alsofeasibility issues with enforcing a testing measRure on children. At this stage,using proof of recovery from COVID-19 as an alternative measure is notrecommended.Y24 Existing exemptions, such as to do supply chain work, do not apply to CVCsettings, as there is a different risLk-profile and these exemptions are expresslyconnected to the type of work to be undertaken.E25 The Ministry of Health has consulted with the Office of the PrivacyCommissioner who recommended that CVC confirmation is identical for bothVvaccinated and exempt people. This would:I25.1 avoid scanning staff seeing attendees’ private medical information;T25.2 eliminate the possibility of scanning staff asking for further informationCabout attendees’ exemptions; and25.3A prevent businesses from discriminating against exempted persons.26 OAs a result, CVCs could not by proxy prove if an individual has been fullyvaccinated. Rather, they would demonstrate that an individual is authorised toenter a setting. In settings where there may be a vaccine mandate, such as toRundertake certain types of work, it is anticipated that alternative proof ofvaccination could be presented.P27 In terms of granting exemptions, the Ministry of Health will be working throughthe detail of this in the coming weeks. The exemption process will likely bemanaged centrally, rather than directly through a primary care provider orgeneral practitioner to ensure the narrow scope of the exemptions frameworkis maintained.4I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V E28 The legislation to support exemptions will be drafted with enabling provisions,with the detail on the process to be provided through secondary legislationonce this has been agreed by the Ministry of Health.Implementation and operational considerations DOperational considerationsE29 The CVC provides a digitally verifiable record that the person the certificatewas issued to is considered vaccinated for COVID-19. For the purposes oSf theCVC this includes:A29.1 people who have received a suitable schedule of a recognised COVID-19 vaccination, including vaccinations administered overseas, orE29.2 a very limited number of people who are medically exempted fromLbeing vaccinated for COVID-19.30 The Ministry of Health is developing a verifier app thEat will allow eventorganisers and venue security to scan the QR code on the vaccinationcertificate to confirm its validity. The QR code Rwill be available digitally, with apaper option to ensure accessibility. The Ministry is exploring a range ofoptions for making CVCs easy to access for people.Y31 In settings where a CVC is required from patrons under an Order made underthe COVID-19 Public Health ResLponse Act, I propose that the Ministry ofHealth CVC is the only acceptable tool that a person can produce to provethey are considered vaccinaEted, providing certainty for both patrons andPCBUs1. This proposal does not require legislation, which can be progressedVfollowing Cabinet agreement.Data and verification IT32 Primary legislation will need to be developed to make clear that verifiers arenot able toC store, process, or otherwise use data from a CVC except for thepurposes of verifying the pass is valid. I propose that it will be an offence tostore, process or manage data from the CVCs, and that legislation be draftedAto give this effect.O33 Developing a one-size-fits-all verifier app is not feasible in the early stages ofimplementation, and it is expected that by supporting the uptake of CVCs in aR way which works for businesses will have the greatest success.34 We should not legislate that the only permitted verifier app would be thePMinistry of Health Verifier App. The risk of verifiers mis-using data will bemitigated through the legislation proposed in paragraph 32. Further detail onhow this will be supported and managed from a technical perspective willfollow in the coming weeks. If COVID-19-related economic support for1 The term PCBU is used in this paper to also cover those who are also responsible for the place or gathering.5I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V Ebusinesses becomes contingent on use of CVCs, work will need to be done toidentify how to establish business compliance.35 There is no explicit obligation on the PCBU to ensure that the CVC belongs tothe holder, however verifiers may request secondary identification when Dverifying CVCs if they wish to.E36 I propose that it is not mandated to request identification, as it is difficult torequire equitably. I recognise that with the proposed introduction of CVCSmandates in broader settings, that a wider proportion of people will beimpacted. Those without photo identification should not automatically beAexcluded on that basis.37 By adopting a model which does not mandate additional identEification to verifythe identity of CVC holders, there is an associated risk of fraudulent CVCsbeing presented. There is a balancing act between ensuLring easy, inclusiveaccess to services for vaccinated people, and being able to conclusivelyEidentify people, particularly given the settings where CVCs may be requested.38 Factors such as the type of event or setting, aRnd the likelihood of fraudulentCVC being presented, could be considered by the verifier if requestingidentification. For instance, it may be rea sonable that a verifier requestadditional identification where certain Ytypes of identification may already berequired to enter, such as bars and nightclubs. Additionally, by exemptingLthose under 12 years and 3 months, we are assuming a high-trust model.Verifiers will need to use their discretion when asking for confirmation of theEage of patrons.CVC use case example V39 The following example steps out, at a high-level, the process of presentingIand verifying aT CVC:Step 1 Patron presents their CVC at point of entryCEither via smartphone or printed copyCVC will show name and date of birth of CVC holderAStep 2 Verifier scans with Verifier appThis could be done by a worker on a smartphone or tablet orOthrough an automated ticketing systemStep 3 Verifier app checks the signature is authenticR If the details are valid, a green tick will appearIf the details are invalid the verifier sees an error messageStep 4 Verifier may request additional information toPcorroborateThe verifier may request additional information to confirm theidentity of the CVC holder (e.g. additional identification)Step 5 Patron is permitted to enterIf CVC holder is authorised, patron permitted to enter settingIf CVC holder is unauthorised, they are denied entry andobligation is with PCBU to ensure patron does not entersetting6I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V EOverseas vaccinations and issuing CVCs40 Work is underway to establish policy and operational pathways for peopleDwho have been vaccinated overseas to obtain a domestic CVC. Key issuesthat need to be resolved are which overseas administered COVID-19Evaccines can be recorded against an individual’s health record for people nowliving in New Zealand, and how domestic vaccination certificates can beSissued to people who are visiting New Zealand for a short period.A41 Officials are seeking advice from the Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 VaccineTechnical Advisory Group on which vaccines that would be acceptable for thisEpolicy. This advice will inform a policy position on these matters for earlyNovember.LTimeframesE42 The Ministry of Health advises that the earliest date for introducing andoperationalising CVCs is the end of NovemberR. Both the legislation required tointroduce CVCs, and the technological system to support their use, will beready for wide use at that time.Y43 The Ministry of Health is working to the following timeframes for implementingthe CVC:LPhase 1  Online portal to view COVID-19EMy COVID Record & interim vaccination recordsperiod  Targeted invitations to domesticV(12 Oct – early November) individuals with first or secondvaccinationIT Manual support channelsavailablePhase 2 C  Vaccination certificate via emailPiloted non-mandated use in PDF form(earAly November)  Verifier app that can readcertificates and communicateauthorisation to enter venueO Operational framework forVerifier app usageR Pilot ticketed events15 November CAB approves Bill for introduction.P Bill introduced.Phase 3  Events and/or environments thatGeneral non-mandated use meet defined Verifier(late November) requirements may participate26 November Royal assent and Orders gazetted tosupport introduction on CVCs7I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V EPhase 4  Events and/or environments thatReady for general mandated use meet defined Verifierfollowing product testing requirements to participate(End of November)DCompliance and EnforcementEOn whom should the obligation be placed?S44 In the context of CVCs, I propose that legal obligations are borne by both thePCBU and the individual (which includes workers). A45 This would mean that the PCBU has an obligation to check and verify CVCsEof all attendees at the point of entry, as the harm of non-compliance isincurred by the act of entry. For workers, PCBUs may choose to check theirLCVC (or any other proof of vaccination) once, and rely on that for subsequententries. PCBUs would also have an obligation to take reasonable steps toEprevent unauthorised persons from entering an event or premises.R46 Officials note that the duty to check all attendees may result in additionalcompliance costs for PCBUs whereby additional staff may need to beemployed to perform the entry checking function. It is also possible anyYadditional costs for PCBUs may be passed on to patrons.47 For the individual, the obligation Lwould be to carry (and produce whenrequested by an authorised person) evidence of a CVC where it is amandated condition of entryE to an event or setting. The requirement to holdand produce a valid CVC would also cover any attempts to gain access withfraudulent documentatVion, and deliberately entering without evidence of aCVC.I48 For workers, thTey would be obliged not to do certain work without a CVC orhaving established that they are vaccinated to their employer or PCBU, or theemployer Cor PCBU responsible for the setting.49 In thAe context of (private and otherwise) gatherings, where there is both afacility owner and event organiser – the obligation on the PCBU is an either/or– only one of them is responsible for making sure attendees CVCs areOcheckedupon arrival. In this case, it is up to the organiser and owner todecide between them who will carry out the obligation, and therefore who isR responsible and subject to an infringement penalty, if they fail to carry out theobligation.P50 Breaching any of these obligations would be an offence under section 26 ofthe Act.Penalties51 I propose that the penalties for the proposed offences are aligned with thepenalties as proposed by the COVID-19 Public Health Response AmendmentBill (No 2) 2021 (the Bill). With regards to the type of fine issued in the event8I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V Eof non-compliance, I propose that both infringement and court-imposed finescould apply to both PCBUs and individuals.52 It is important to note that the Bill only sets out maximum offence fees,whereby the scale of fees will be set out in regulations. The use of fines for Dbusinesses that fail to meet their CVC obligations, and for unvaccinatedindividuals who enter a CVC-controlled events, must be proportionate andEevidence-based.SEnforcement53 To remove an individual from a CVC mandated setting on the basisA of CVCstatus, enforcement officers will need proof that the person does not meet theCVC requirement. Enforcement officers will need to be provideEd with thepower to issue infringement notices (in the case of Enforcement Officers whoare not New Zealand Police or otherwise already authoriLsed to), and Ipropose Cabinet directs officials to develop detailed guidance on how this canEbest be operationalised.54 Issuing an infringement fee to an individual or RPCBU or event organiser forfailing to meet their CVC obligations, will require enforcement officers to provethat:Y54.1 for a PCBU, the duty to check the CVC of all attendees was notdischarged; andL54.2 for an individual, the duty to carry (and produce) evidence of a CVCEwhere it is a mandated condition of entry was not fulfilled. This mayeither come in the form of an attempt to gain access with fraudulentVdocumentation, or a deliberate entry to a premise without evidence.55 s9(2)(f)(iv) ITCAO56 s9(2)(f)(iv)RP9I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V EBroader considerations for CVC use57 Experience overseas demonstrates the risk of loss of social licence if a CVCis applied too broadly, in a way that is seen as interfering too much in day-to-day affairs. It also has the potential to deny access to everyday services to Dpeople who are legally exercising their right to not be vaccinated.E58 It is preferable that all eligible people in New Zealand would have sufficientopportunity to be vaccinated before a CVC requirement is introduced, to avoidSinequitable prevention of access to events to those who have not had theopportunity to be vaccinated due to the staged eligibility of the roll out. GivenAthe progress of the vaccination programme to date, there has been sufficientlyreasonable time from when the eligibility of vaccines was broadened to whenEthe measures proposed in this paper would be implemented [CAB-21-MIN-0421].L59 While there has been a considerable lift in vaccinations for Māori, there isEsignificant concern over the remaining number of vaccinations needed in the12-40 year old age groups to achieve equity. The recently established $120Rmillion fund to accelerate Māori vaccination rates and support communities toprepare for the implementation of the new COVID-19 Protection Frameworkwill seek to address this.YNext StepsL60 Further work is required to develop industry specific guidance prior to theintroduction of CVCs. OfficiaEls will also confirm the extent to which CVCswould be prohibited in teaching and transport settings (e.g. school transportservices), and governmVent services and how best to differentiate settings inthese contexts to ensure public safety. Officials will continue to report onprogress of CVCIs to the Vaccine Ministers group.T61 Officials will develop a process for engaging with government agencies toCclarify which types of government services would or could be subject to CVCrequirements and which ones would be exempt. I recognise there will beAsome agencies that will need clarity on this, so as not to have their ability tooperate and deliver services impeded by CVC requirements.O62 I propose that officials review the policy in early 2022 and report back tome. This would recognise that CVCs are considered as a temporaryRmeasure. It would also provide an opportunity to monitor the effectivenessand wider impacts of the policy, as well as assess whetherPany equity concerns related to the use of CVCs have eventuated.Financial Implications63 There are no direct financial implications for the recommendations in thispaper.10I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V E64 s9(2)(f)(iv)65 s9(2)(f)(iv) DES66 s9(2)(f)(iv)AELegislative ImplicationsL67 New Orders will be made under the Act to bring the new framework into force.E68 With regard to vaccination requirements, it would be possible to introduce arequirement to be vaccinated to enter certain settings through secondaryRlegislation, as such requirements are within the scope of powers provided tothe Minister for COVID-19 Response under the Act, so long as the measuresare consistent with the NZBORA.Y69 s9(2)(h)LEVIT70 s9(2)(h)CAOR71 Cabinet invited the Minister for COVID-19 Response to issue draftinginstructions on these points on 18 October.P72 There are additional proposals in this paper which will require legislation.There will be additional legislation to be developed around the obligations andenforcement of the CVC mandates, as well as on the operations andapplication of CVCs as the only acceptable tool in CVC settings.Impact Analysis73 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) Team has determined thatthe proposals in this Cabinet paper relating to COVID-19 Vaccination11I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V ECertificates for domestic use are exempt from the requirement to provide aRegulatory Impact Statement (RIS) on the grounds that they are intended tomanage, mitigate or alleviate the short-term impacts of a declared emergencyevent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implementation of the policy isDrequired urgently to be effective (making a complete, robust and timely RISunfeasible).E74 Given the significance of the potential impacts of this proposal, the RIA Teamstrongly supports the review to be carried out in early 2022, which shouldSassess wider impacts and policy lessons, including any equity concerns.APopulation Impacts75 Since the beginning of the response, groups such as older peEople, disabledpeople, Māori, Pacific peoples, some ethnic communities and ruralcommunities have been more affected by both the healthL and non-healthimpacts of COVID-19 than others. Disabled people, Māori and Pacific peoplesEare more likely to experience these impacts, as they have higher rates ofunderlying health conditions and co-morbidities. Reducing the risk of COVID-R19 spreading throughout the community will benefit these groups.76 While at an aggregate level there remain s strong trust in government, thereare ongoing and increased concerns aYnd anxieties among some Māori andother population groups around surveillance and low trust in governmentagencies. At the same time the dLemographic features of the population,particularly Māori and Pacific, has higher levels of structural disadvantage andcurrently has the lowest rateE of uptake of the vaccination. These factors couldlead to certain groups perceiving that CVCs confer privileges and that theyare excluded from socViety by not accessing CVC settings. It is important thatthe introduction of CVCs does not create a barrier for people to accessgovernment servIices.T77 The measures in this paper centre on the vaccination status of an individual.This couldC exacerbate existing inequities in the vaccination coverage amongdifferent groups. Programmes such as the rapid vaccine accelerationprogAramme for Māori communities may help address this risk. However, theuse of vaccine requirements in some places could have the effect ofOincreasing vaccination rates as people have further incentive to bevaccinated.R78Transparent and outward facing engagement is likely to be critical tosuccessful adoption of CVCs. Tailored, Māori-led communication strategiesP will also be required.79 Disabled people consulted on the CVC provided strong feedback that peoplewho were legitimately exempt from receiving vaccinations should not beprevented from attending events. It was important that the CVC should notidentify whether people were exempt or otherwise in order to prevent eventorganisers interrogating the reason for vaccination exemption.12I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V E80 With the vaccination uptake varying across groups and some groups notbeing eligible (e.g. children under 12 and those for health reasons) for thevaccine, any access based on vaccination status could result in social,economic and cultural inequities for affected groups. This includes for youngDpeople who are the last eligible group to receive the vaccine and marginalisedgroups that are traditionally harder to reach (e.g. homeless people and thoseEless likely to have identification material), who are all eligible to be vaccinatedin New Zealand.SRisks related to social cohesionA81 The introduction of CVCs will likely have an impact on social cohesion.Revised settings for the introduction of CVCs are broader than what wasEoriginally considered by Cabinet on 18 November. Those without CVCs willpotentially be excluded from a much wider range of social settings. This risksLisolating the unvaccinated and increases the likelihood that we will see large-scale protests similar to those experienced in other Ecountries that haveintroduced vaccine requirements.R82 There is also a risk that restrictions on where unvaccinated people may gocould negatively impact the trust that has been built around the COVID-19vaccination rollout and to address vaccine hesitancy that is linked to a widerYmistrust of the health system. Targeted funding, programmes, communicationand education could be important in mitigating this risk, and will be addressedLin further advice on the implementation of CVCs. Continued focus on andincreased resourcing to supEport, initiatives led by iwi/hapū, urban Māori, andMāori organisations involved in the communication design and delivery ofapproaches may also Vhelp address this risk.Te Tiriti o Waitangi implicationsIT83 Treaty principles require the Crown to do what is reasonable in thecircumstances and do not necessarily require the Crown to adopt a particularCcourse of action. In this context, if vaccination rates for Māori as a populationgroup remain lower than for other groups, the countervailing considerationsAthat have to be balanced are that CVCs might affect Māori disproportionatelyin terms of accessing certain facilities, but they will also protect Māori byOlowering the risk of transmission. The health outcomes for the widerpopulation are also an important consideration.R84In developing approaches to CVCs, we have considered the distinct rightsand interests of Māori to understanding the context of Te Tiriti o WaitangiPconsiderations. We have obtained information as to where distinct Māoriinterests arise from through feedback from Te Arawhiti, Te Puni Kōkiri,DPMC’s Community Panel and at a Ministerial level, the National Iwi ChairsForum (NICF). The Crown’s particular interests include the Crown’s duty toprotect Māori health equitably and actively, protect Māori cultural activitiesand the Crown’s responsibility to address the disproportionately low vaccineuptake by Māori.13I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V E85 Currently, the disproportionately lower vaccination levels for Māori means thatlimiting access to domestic facilities based on vaccination status would have agreater effect on the personal freedom of Māori on an individual and collectivebasis. Further, CVCs would have an impact on large, Māori-organised eventsD(e.g., Te Matatini, Waka Ama Sprint Nationals). This could negatively impactthe trust that has been built for the COVID-19 vaccination rollout and couldEenhance vaccine hesitancy, if it further decreases trust (although it may alsomotivate some to obtain vaccinations).S86 To reduce the impact of this, a communication strategy could be developed towork with Māori to support the use of CVCs. Māori-led communicatiAons couldbetter support trust and ability to build understanding about using CVC as apublic health tool against COVID-19. The NICF and DPMC CoEmmunity Panelrecommended that Marae, Māori businesses and event organisers shoulddecide how to operate with CVCs, for example through dLeveloping guidance,and how to communicate the use of CVCs. Te Matatini organisers haveEalready been proactive by introducing vaccination requirements for attendees.Human Rights R87 s9(2)(h)YLEV88 s9(2)(h)ITCAO89 s9(2)(h)RPs9(2)(h)90 s9(2)(h)14I N CO NF I D E NC ESE N S I TI V Es9(2)(h)DEConsultationS91 Officials have undertaken targeted consultation on the use of CVCs withbusiness and community representatives.

The 7-day rolling averageof cases since the previous risk assessment on 13 October has increasedrfrom 38 to 89 as at 9am Thursday 28 October. Over the past month casesP have dispersed across Auckland. There has also been a transition fromcomplex households being the focus for concern to the risk posed by growthamong various forms of residential housing, healthcare facilities, and someeducational centres. Private gatherings continue to be a major driver oftransmission.7 The effective reproduction number (R ) remains between 1.2 and 1.3.effHowever, the return of Year 11 to 13 students to school on Tuesday 26October may yet have an effect on transmission, which will be evident withinthe next week.

The othercase is a household contact considered to be infected by the initaial case. Itnotes there are currently no concerning exposure events that could lead tosuper-spreader events and that a move to Alert Level 3 is enot proportionate atthis stage, pending further information about the test results and movement ofclose contacts.

I propose that, ifsufficient evidence supporting consideration of an earlier move becomeseavailable, Ministers with Power to Act review and take decisions, informed bypublic health advice, in the week of 8 November on whether Auckland and/orsthe Waikato should move to stage two.16 More information about requiring workers crossing the Alert Leveal boundary tobe vaccinated is also provided. There are significant operational challengesassociated with this vaccination requirement, which will takee time to resolve.

It alsoassumes reduced case management and contact tracing effectiveness aboveP1000 active cases.21 Three of these projections are presented again here relating to the“optimistic”, “middle” and “pessimistic” scenarios for transmission. Figure 1shows the R over time for these scenarios, and Figure 2 shows theeffprojected case numbers which result.22 In reality, R will not behave in the manner depicted in Figure 1.

These will dproject future case numbers based on high, medium and low transmissionscenarios and the outputs will be included in future Alert Level RevieweCabinet papers.Reopening schools s26 Te Pūnaha Matatini’s network contagion model team has simulaated thepotential impacts of reopening schools. The results indicate that reopeningschools is likely to create broader transmission by increasing theeconnectedness of the community: households become linked when theyotherwise would not, increasing the potential chains of transmission, and theloverall number of infections, outside of school environments. The expectedeincrease in transmission is greater if schools are reopened to all pupils.Transmission outside Auckland R27 The projections above are based on increasing rates of vaccination inAuckland. They are not generalisabl e nor should they be appliedproportionately across New Zealaynd, given the stage of the outbreak and theboundary between Auckland and the rest of the country.l28 We can expect exposure events outside of Auckland will increase ineproportion with any rise in case numbers within Auckland. Previous modellingresults demonstrate that it would then take some time for significantvtransmission to occur in other regions, with time to scale up the localresponse. For example, if cases were only detected through genericicommunity surveillance, and around 20 to 40 percent of symptomatic peopletwere getting tested, outbreaks would be expected to be detected around 10cdays after the seeding event, with around 40 infections total at the time of firstdetection. Similar to a new outbreak at the national level, modelling resultsasuggest that there is a greater chance of elimination of an outbreak at thelocal level if:o28.1new cases are detected early, through intensive testing efforts in thesymptomatic population and those who cross the Alert Level boundary;randP28.2 there is an immediate response to any emergence of new cases whichare suggestive of wider spread (such as no clear link to the Aucklandpopulation).5SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VEDirector-General of Health’s assessment against the health factors as at 28OctoberAucklanddTrends in the daily number of casese29 As at 9:30am Thursday 28 October, there have been 2,793 cases in theAuckland region and 1,284 of these cases remain active. The overall numbersof new daily cases reported in the Auckland region has increased throughoutOctober, though not exponentially. The seven-day rolling average foraAuckland as at Thursday 28 October is 89 cases. This is an increase from aseven-day rolling average of 38 cases reported for the previous riskeassessment, undertaken on 13 October. Case numbers continue to track asexpected and continue to grow, within a R of between 1.2 and 1.3.effl30 There has continued to be a shift from complex hoeuseholds to the risk posedby growth among various forms of residential housing, healthcare facilitiesand some educational centres. Private gatherings continue to be a majorRdriver of transmission in Auckland. Several cases have been identified in high-risk settings including residential housing and health care settings.Contact tracing and compliancey31 As at 9am Thursday 28 October, there are 2,036 open contacts and 36,352lcontacts with a quarantine address in Auckland. 2,027 (99 percent) of openecontacts and 34,241 (94 percent) of all contacts have received an outboundcall from contact tracers to confirm testing and isolation requirements.v32 As at 28 October, there is good testing of contacts, with no overdue testing.The system isi stable and coping with volume.

On Wednesday 27 October, 15,468 tests were processed(excluding managed isolation facility guests and workers). In the past sevenr days almost 100,000 tests have been processed.P34 There has been increased levels of essential worker testing, with 43,508tested in the seven days up to and including Wednesday 27 October.Wastewater detections continue across many parts of Auckland35 COVID-19 detections in wastewater sample testing continue across manyparts of Auckland; these detections are expected due to the number of cases.6SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VEVaccination rates across Auckland are above the national average36 Vaccination rates have increased since the public health risk assessment onThursday 14 October. As at Wednesday 27 October, 90 percent of the eligiblepopulation in Auckland have had one dose (up 3 percent), and 78 percentdhave had their second dose (up 13 percent). It is estimated that Aucklandmetro DHBs will reach 90 percent double dose by late November or earlyeDecember.37 Despite that, inequities in vaccination coverage remain by age group asndethnicity. This includes Māori and Pacific peoples still having relatively lowvaccination rates for the 12 to 19 and 20 to 34 age groups, and faor those whohave received a second dose.e38 Details of vaccine uptake by key ethnicities within Auckland Metro DHBs as at11:59pm Wednesday 27 October are included at Appendix 1.lHealth system capacity in Auckland is adequate e39 There are 37 hospitalisations as at Thursday 28 October. Of these, 31 areRactive cases and six are recovered cases. Twelve are in Middlemore (two arein ICU/HDU), 15 in Auckland City Hospital (two in ICU/HDU), seven in NorthShore Hospital (one is in ICU/HDU), one in Waitakere Hospital, two inStarship.y40 Health system and hospital capacity in Auckland is adequate. Hospitalisationslare tracking according to NHRCC forecasts, with peak numbers still expectedein mid-to-late November.41 NHRCC are encourvaged by the lower ICU conversion rate for hospitalisedcases and if this rate continues the risks related to ICU capacity will beminimised. Thiis low conversion rate is likely in part to the younger age profileof cases in tthis outbreak, with the average age of cases and hospitalisationsboth at acround 30-years-old.42 An increasing number of cases are being managed at home (approximatelya310 cases) rather than in MIQ. As a result, capacity in MIQ is adequate. Inaddition, there is capacity to manage about 700 households using primaryocareproviders, which the Director-General has advised should bemanageable at the levels NHRCC are forecasting.r43The individuals who are isolating at home are being managed according toPtheir clinical risk, which includes testing requirements for people who have notbeen diagnosed with COVID-19. Self-isolating individuals (and their families)will also have access to Ministry of Social Development (MSD) welfaresupport and health clinical support.Christchurch44 The Ministry of Health was notified late on Wednesday 27 October of twoCOVID-19 cases in Christchurch from the same household. Both are7SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VEunvaccinated. The available information as at Thursday 28 October indicatesthat their exposures are in mainly lower risk settings such as supermarkets,shops, buses, takeaway shops, and some household visits. At the time of the28 October public health risk assessment, test results from close contactswere pending. As at 9am 31 October, two close contacts had returned dpositive results.e45 Compared to Auckland Metro DHBs, testing rates across Canterbury havebeen low.s46 The virus was not detected in the Christchurch wastewater sample taken onTuesday 26 October. A result from a sample collected from Chrisatchurch onWednesday 27 October was expected by Friday 29 October. There havebeen recent cases identified in the Christchurch MIQ so a edetection in thewastewater may be a result of infection in returnees rather than in thecommunity. The catchment also serves a population of approximately 300,000lso wastewater testing may not detect a small number of cases.e47 Christchurch Community and Public Health have advised that there is goodRcapacity for surge testing if required and that there is MIQ capacity forapproximately 40 cases.48 Rates of vaccination in Canterbury s it close to the national average, with 89percent of people having receivedy their first dose and 69 percent receivingtheir second. Vaccination rates still lag for Māori, which currently sit at 74percent and 51 percent resplectively for first and second doses.e49 Around the suburbs where the two cases reside, rates of vaccination sit closeto around the average for Canterbury, with most of the surrounding localvareas achieving first dose rates of more than 90 percent.iRest of New Zealatnd (excluding Auckland, the Waikato and Christchurch)c50 On Friday 22 October, a case linked to the Te Awamutu sub-cluster wasdetected in Blenheim. The case spent the previous night in Tokoroa (an AlertaLevel 2 area) but testing of contacts has not yet detected further cases. Overthe weekend of 23-24 October five cases were reported in Northland thatowereall linked. Together with the Christchurch cases, these cases show thereremains a heightened risk of cases being seeded to other parts of Newr Zealand from Auckland and Waikato.P51 Community testing rates continue to be the lowest in areas outside ofAuckland, Northland, and Waikato, particularly in the South Island. Therehave been no unexpected wastewater detections outside of the Waikato,Auckland, and Palmerston North areas.52 Vaccination uptake in the rest of New Zealand continues to increase but at alower rate than previous weeks.8SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VEWaikato53 A public health risk assessment for the Waikato Alert Level 3 area wasundertaken on Tuesday 26 October. It noted that, while the risk of undetectedcommunity transmission was not increasing, the situation in the area was not dfully contained and remained a concern. Informed by this assessment andMinistry of Health advice, Ministers with Power to Act agreed to the WaikatoeAlert Level 3 area moving to stage one of the reduced Alert Level 3 from11.59pm Wednesday 27 October. An updated public health risk assessmentswill be completed on Sunday 31 October.aDirector-General of Health’s conclusions as at 28 October (excluding Waikato)54 Given that the available evidence indicates that the risk is enot decreasing andis most likely slowly increasing, there is not yet a basis to ease restrictions inAuckland. le55 Cases numbers in Auckland are tracking as expected, with a R of betweeneff1.2 and 1.3 with an upwards trajectory. We have also yet to see the full impactRof the recent reopening of schools for Year 11 to 13 students on Tuesday 26October and whether it will result in increased transmission. Easingrestrictions further at this time could add too many extra variables into currentoutbreak. In the meantime, there continues to be a focus on gettingyvaccination rates up across Auckland.l56 While the Director-General has considered a step down to stage 2 of AlerteLevel 3, he has concluded it is too early. The current restrictions are helpingto keep case numbers lower than they might otherwise be. A comparison ofthis outbreak with thvat in Victoria has shown the impact of restrictions andvaccinations, despite Auckland’s outbreak initially accelerating much fasterthan in Victoriai.t57 A public chealth risk assessment for Christchurch was conducted following theassessment for Auckland and the rest of New Zealand. Due to the early stageof case investigation, with test results from the identified close contacts yet toacome, the Director-General recommends that the existing Alert Level 2settings should remain in place. However, the situation in Christchurch andothepublic health settings will need to be reviewed following the results of theclose contacts.r58Previous circumstances where we recommended an escalation to Alert LevelP3 (e.g. Northland) was when the initial case was not being cooperative withcontact tracers, which provided very little information to inform decisionmaking. In this situation, the initial information from the two cases has quicklyidentified the contacts which are at most risk, who are being tested.59 There is a continued risk that COVID-19 may be seeded outside of the AlertLevel 3 boundary, particularly with increasing case numbers in the Aucklandregion. As such, it is recommended that Alert Level 2 restrictions arecontinued and be reinforced while the risk in Auckland and other Level 3areas remains high.9SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VE60 The Director-General noted that consideration should be given to the settingsfor outdoor gatherings and events to allow no limits on gathering size. Thisrecognises that outdoor gatherings and events are very low risk and would notappreciably increase the risk of transmission. This advice is also consistentwith the initial public health advice for Alert Level 2 settings. d61 Based on the public health risk assessment completed on Thursday 28eOctober, the Director-General’s interim health assessment is:61.1 the risk of undetected community transmission in Auckland remsainshigh; anda61.2 the risk of undetected community transmission for the rest of NewZealand (excluding parts of Waikato currently at Alert Level 3 Step 1eand Christchurch) is low.lDirector-General of Health’s recommendations e62 The Director-General’s interim public health advice is that:R62.1 Auckland remain at Alert Level 3 Step 1 until at least 11.59pm Monday15 November.62.2 Christchurch remain at Aleyrt Level 2 for the time being as further caseinvestigation and testing occurs and is actively monitored. Obtainingthe results for identified close contacts is critical for determining if alhigher Alert Level ies required.62.3 The rest of New Zealand (excluding parts of the Waikato currently atvAlert Level 3 Step 1 and Christchurch) remain at Alert Level 2 until atleast 11.59pm Monday 15 November.it62.4 An updated public health risk assessment be undertaken to reviewthcese settings on Thursday 11 November.63 At tahe same time, there following needs to continue:63.1 increasing vaccination rates, with a particular focus on rural andovulnerable communities;r 63.2 encouraging the public to continue to be tested if they are a contact ofP a case and/or have any COVID-19 symptoms; and63.3 increasing communications to reinforce and improve compliance toAlert Level 2 restrictions.64 The Director-General also recommends that consideration is given to easingrestrictions on outdoor gatherings and events at Alert Level 2 to allow no limitson gathering size noting that outdoor gatherings and events are very low riskand would not appreciably increase the risk of transmission.10SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VEProposal regarding Alert Levels65 On the basis of the public health risk assessment on 28 October and theDirector-General’s interim public health advice, I propose Cabinet agrees to:d65.1 keep Auckland at the current Alert Level 3 (the first stage of the three-stage reduction) until 11.59pm Tuesday 16 November; ande65.2 keep the rest of New Zealand outside the Alert Level 3 areas at AlertLevel 2 until 11.59pm Tuesday 16 November. s66 I also propose Cabinet take decisions on whether to keep the Waaikato at thecurrent Alert Level 3 (the first stage of the three-stage reduction), informed byan updated public health risk assessment to be undertaken on Sunday 31eOctober and an oral update today from the Director-General.67 I note that, since the completion of the 28 October pulblic health riskeassessment, there has been an increase in daily case numbers in Auckland.This is putting pressure on contact tracing capacity, which may be reached inthe coming days if numbers continue at this Rlevel in Auckland or increase.There were 135 new community cases in Auckland in the 24 hours to 9amSunday 31 October, with 6 new cases in the Waikato and 2 in Northland.68 The Director-General’s oral update will also include the latest situation andyappropriate Alert Level across all New Zealand today.l69 I propose Cabinet next review Alert Level settings on Monday 15 November.eFor Auckland and the Waikato, earlier consideration of a move to stage two ofthe three-stage Alert Level 3 reduction may be possible. I propose that, ifvsufficient evidence supporting an earlier move becomes available, Ministerswith Power to Act review and take decisions, informed by public heath adviceiin the week of 8 November on whether Auckland and/or the Waikato shouldtmove to stage two.c70 With regards the Director-General’s recommendation that consideration isgivean to easing restrictions on outdoor gatherings at Alert Level 2, in light ofthe risk of community transmission both within and out of the Auckland andWaikato Alert Level 3 areas, I do not think it appropriate to increase caps.oHowever,I will consider this following future public health risk assessmentsand whether we can step down to stage two of Alert Level 3.rPAssessmentof the proposed measures/options against the non-health factors71 I have assessed the options against the non-health factors agreed by Cabinet,as set out below.

However, it has fallensince, with 6,066 more people now on a main benefit than before lockdown.1 Some of these GDP losses will occur even without Alert Level restrictions, as people adjust their behaviour inresponse to perceived risk.2 This estimate is based on a scenario where the entire Waikato region is at a standard Alert Level 3. The datacurrently available does not allow for estimates of sub-regional impacts, or for estimates of the impacts ofintermediate steps to ease Auckland’s Alert level 3 restrictions.12SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VE77 Food grants increased significantly in the first two weeks after lockdown butthen started trending lower.

TheAuckland region peaked in early September with 38 percent of all food grants,but is now receiving 30 percent (similar to the week before lockdown). The dWaikato region has not seen any major increase in food grants since theintroduction of Alert Level 3.e78 The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has been providing supportsthrough the New Zealand Food Network as well as funding and support toproviders to meet demand for food and essential items.

While some relaxation of restrictions iswelcomed, with cases in the community, many older peopale areanxious about going out to get food, keep medical appointments ormeet up with family/whānau. They are also starting eto get concernedabout whether they will be able to see family, whānau and friends overChristmas and the summer holiday period and their ability to plan.le81.8 There was a ten percent increase in the number of contacts withYouthline Helpline last week compared to the previous week, from 388Rto 428.

DHBs have spent the past 18 months preparing to manageCOVID-19 surges within hospitals and the primary and the community caresector has also adapted to dealing with COVID-19.y89 A key focus now is the finalisation of a community model of care for mangingmost COVID-19 cases safelly in the community. This work is being expeditedacross Auckland, and a neational approach will be finalised ready forimplementation nationwide from early November as part of a wider NationalHealth Resilience Programme.v90 Health sector workforce capability and capacity remains a significantichallenge. There are known pre-existing skills gaps and workforce shortages.tThe Ministry is working with the sector to develop an immediate roadmap andcimplementation plan to address workforce shortages, including throughenabling immigration of key workers.a91 Most COVID-19 positive cases will not need hospital-level care and will beosafely cared for at home or in a community facility, but this will vary dependingon vaccination status, ethnicity and socio-economic issues such as housing.The Ministry of Health is working with the Ministry of Social Development andracross existing community groups to develop welfare and wrap-aroundPservice support for COVID-19 care in the community.Alert Level BoundariesUpdate on current boundaries92 Alert Level boundaries are currently in place to minimise movement into, outof, or through the Auckland and Waikato Alert Level 3 areas.15SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VE93 Section 9(2)(b)(ii)d94 As at 8am Friday 29 October, there had been 22,963 requests for personalexemptions, with 22,344 decisions made and 4,852 approved. The majority ofeapprovals continue to relate to funerals, tangihanga, visiting a dying person,or need for mental health support.s95 As at 8am Friday 29 October, there had been a total of 5,129 requests forbusiness exemptions. Of these, 523 were approved, 3,399 werea declined and1207 are pending.e96 A total of 14,600 businesses had been issued Business Travel Documents asat 28 October, enabling 87,300 workers to cross Alert Level boundaries.lTransport (4,300 businesses, 32,300 workers) and primary industries (3,000ebusinesses, 15,100 workers) account for just over half of this permittedbusiness travel.RVaccination requirements for people transiting Alert Level boundaries97 On Monday 18 October, Cabinet agreed in principle, subject to further workon operational implications and coynsultation with affected industries, thatpeople crossing the Alert Level boundary for work purposes be required to bevaccinated [CAB-21-MIN-04l22 refers]. Officials advise there are significantoperational challenges thaet require time to resolve before any requirementcomes into effect. For this reason I consider that Cabinet decisions could betaken on any requirvement on Monday 15 November when we will considerhow to enable a pathway for vaccinated people across the Auckland boundaryunder the COVID-19 Protection Framework.it98 Requiring those crossing the Alert Level boundary for work purposes to becvaccinated aligns with the intent of the COVID-19 Protection Framework, akey premise of which is to enable more activity to occur where people areavaccinated. By helping to mitigate the risk of the virus being transmittedoutside of an Alert Level boundary, the requirement would also support ourooverallpublic health response to COVID-19, to prevent and limit the outbreakor spread of the virus.r99Officials advise this vaccination requirement should be coupled with testingPrequirements that already apply to people travelling across an Alert Levelboundary for work.3 These testing requirements are well-known to impactedparties and provide an additional layer of protection to assist in mitigating therisk associated with travel across a boundary. Changing the testingrequirements for workers who also must be vaccinated to cross the boundarywould add unnecessary complexity and risk causing confusion about what is3 Clause 19A of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 12) 2021outlines COVID-19 testing obligations of certain people travelling into and out of Alert Level 3 areas for workactivities.16SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VErequired to cross. Public health advice supports requiring workers crossingthe boundary to carry evidence of both vaccination status and having had aCOVID-19 test in the past seven days.100 For this requirement, the same definitions of COVID-19 vaccine and dvaccination used in the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Vaccinations)Order 2021 would apply.eCompliance and enforcements101 A dual legal obligation could be employed for the mandatory vaccinationrequirement: a101.1 For the individual, that they must carry evidence of their vaccinationestatus when crossing an Alert Level boundary for work purposes anddisclose their vaccination status to their employer. Disclosure oflvaccination status is necessary to support PCBUs with workforceeplanning, based on which employers are vaccinated and who aretherefore able to cross the boundary.R101.2 For the PCBU, obligations would be similar to those currently in placefor testing requirements. Specifically, to support workers to getvaccinated and not to allow an y unvaccinated workers to cross theboundary for work purposeys.102 The number of people who are unable to get vaccinated for medical reasonslin New Zealand is currently low (estimated to be fewer than 200 peopleenationally). For this reason, those who cannot receive the vaccination formedical reasons could be exempt from this new vaccination requirement.vPublic health advice supports this exemption. The Director-General of Healthwould continue to have the power to grant exemptions from the requirementifor other reasons.4t103 Section 9(2c)(f)(iv)ao104 COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates (CVCs) could be used to verify compliancerwith the requirement at Alert Level boundaries. Officials are working toP introduce CVCs widely by the beginning of December, meaning introductionand compliance monitoring of the requirement to carry a CVC could notcommence until then, if it is agreed that CVCs are used. The alternative wouldbe a paper-based record of vaccination, which would have operational,verification and privacy implications.105 While 100 percent compliance monitoring would be preferable given the riskof transmission across boundaries, this level of manual checking would have4 Clause 54 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Alert Level Requirements) Order (No 12) 2021.17SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VEsignificant operational and resource implications. Traffic flows across theboundary would be adversely impacted by intensive manual checking. Policecurrently carry out spot checks of freight vehicles crossing Alert Levelboundaries, and 100 percent checking of other vehicles. Officials haveadvised that 100 percent checking of all vehicles, including freight, for dvaccination requirements is not possible, and a spot checking approach wouldbe adopted. WorkSafe would monitor PCBU compliance.e106 Breaching these obligations would be an offence under section 26 of thesCOVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 (the Act). Penalties for theproposed offences could be aligned with the current penalties in the Act (andathose in the COVID-19 Public Health Response Amendment Bill (No 2) 2021when it is enacted). With regards to the type of fine issued in the event of non-compliance, both infringement and court-imposed fines coeuld apply.107 For any workers who do not or cannot get vaccinated (or who refuse tolconfirm their vaccination status), standard employment law provisions wouldeapply. In other words, redeployment of employees to work that does notrequire travel across an Alert Level boundary in the first instance, followed byRtermination as a last resort.Operational and implementation considerations108 Introducing a mandatory vaccinatyion requirement for workers crossing theboundary presents significant operational and economic challenges. Officialsadvise that in the time availalble, limited engagement has been undertakenand it has not been possibele to engage with and receive feedback from allpotentially affected sectors. I am advised that the following key concerns andconsiderations were expressed:v108.1 Accurately quantifying the number of people likely to be impacted byithis proposal will be difficult. This is because several affected sectorstare not currently subject to a mandatory vaccination requirement. Thiscmeansthere is currently no legal basis to require employees to sharetheir vaccination status with their employer.a108.2 If there are high numbers of unvaccinated workers in key industrieso when the new requirement comes into effect, supply chain issues anddisruption to domestic air travel schedules, for example, may emerge.r108.3 A number of those consulted suggested a lead in time of at least four toPsix weeks between announcement and the requirement coming intoeffect. Those consulted considered this lead in time to be necessary toallow impacted workers to receive both doses of the vaccination, andfor PCBUs to establish employee vaccination status. A reasonable leadin time will also help to mitigate some of the potential supply chainconcerns noted above.108.4 There is concern that the mandatory requirement would come intoeffect around the Christmas and New Year holiday period, which mayheighten supply chain issues.18SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VE108.5 Compliance monitoring of the requirement may create congestion anddelays at Alert Level boundary checkpoints (road and air), due toadditional checks being required at these checkpoints.108.6 Questions likely to be raised about why mandatory vaccination is not dproposed to be expanded to all people crossing the boundary, not justworkers.e109 A prominent theme of the feedback received from affected sectors is timing –when the requirement will be introduced and whether there will be sufsficienttime to meet new obligations introduced with it. In light of this, the newvaccination requirement could be announced on Monday 15 Novaember ifCabinet decisions are taken on this requirement. The requirement could thenbe enacted in the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Aleret LevelRequirements) Order (No 12) 2021, but commencement of the legalrequirement to carry evidence of vaccination when crossing the boundarylcould be delayed until at least 1 December, to align with the implementation ofeCVCs.R110 Between now and the start of December, the following phasing could beadopted to support compliance and monitoring of compliance with the newrequirement:110.1 Workers crossing the bounydary are strongly encouraged to bevaccinated following the announcement, before the legal requirementcomes into effect. le110.2 In the week commencing 15 November, the obligation on individualemployees to disclose their vaccination status comes into effect. Thisvwould support PCBUs in gaining an understanding of the proportion oftheir workforce that is vaccinated, and to start planning rosters andischedules accordingly.tc110.3 In the week commencing 29 November, it is anticipated CVCs will beimplemented. This would assist PCBUs in confirming employees’avaccinationstatus and forward rosters and schedules. CVCs will alsoprovide the requisite evidence for employees crossing the boundary.o111 There are two options for when the legal obligation itself, requiring peoplecrossing an Alert Level boundary to carry evidence of having beenrvaccinated, could come into effect. The first is in the week commencingP29 November, when CVCs are implemented. An alternative option, which Iunderstand is the transport sector’s preference, would be to delaycommencement of the obligation until the week commencing 13 December.These additional two weeks would provide a buffer for any delays inimplementing the CVCs, and would give PCBUs an opportunity to firm up theirrosters and schedules based on who they confirm is vaccinated using acombination of employee disclosures and CVCs.112 Officials considered whether the requirement could be implemented sooner ifonly one dose of the vaccination was required as a first step, instead of19SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VErequiring people to be fully vaccinated. I am advised a phased implementationwould not shorten timeframes because the verification, evidential andplanning time constraints persist regardless of whether a single or doubledose of the vaccine is required.d113 Introducing the requirement earlier is not recommended because time isrequired for workers to get vaccinated, and for PCBUs to undertake workfloweplanning to minimise supply chain and other impacts, based on whichemployees are vaccinated and permitted to move across the boundary.sEmployees would have an obligation to disclose their vaccination status totheir employer, but some employees may still refuse to do so. Theseaemployees would have to be treated as unvaccinated by their employer forthe purposes of workforce planning. Alternatives, including allowing PCBUs toaccess employees’ vaccination records from the Ministry oef Health to verifythe status disclosed to them by the employee, have been discounted byofficials. This is due to resource and privacy considerations.le114 As noted above CVCs could be used to verify vaccination status. This wouldmean the requirement could not come into effect until 1 December at theRearliest. If we wanted to bring the requirement into force earlier an alternativeform of evidence to verify vaccination status and exemption from therequirement on medical grounds would be needed. Other forms of evidencecould include hard copy vaccination cards or a letter from a GeneralyPractitioner or the Ministry of Health detailing vaccination status. Multipleevidence options could impact enforcement officers’ ability to accurately verifywhether or not a person melets the vaccination requirements.e115 Requiring all people crossing the boundary for work purposes from Decemberwould provide a usevful illustration of the impacts of vaccination and testingrequirements on things like traffic flows and supply chains. Having thisinformation coiuld inform work to expand mandatory vaccination of all peoplecrossing Aletrt Level boundaries. This work is being progressed as part of theCOVID-19 Protection Framework.cAdditional apermissions for building and construction116 On 18 October, Cabinet noted that I would bring a proposal to Cabinet onoMonday1 November 2021 on whether to allow workers involved in buildingand construction of infrastructure that contributes to government priorityr projects to cross boundaries [CAB-21-MIN-0422 refers]. Given the risk ofcommunity transmission in Auckland remains high, I do not consider thesePchanges prudent at this time.117 I understand that the Construction Sector Accord have signalled a level ofurgency sits around supporting fully vaccinated workers to be able to travelacross the Auckland boundary, to address financial pressures for workers andfirms. They are connected into the advice being developed on how fullyvaccinated workers will be able to cross the Auckland boundaries under theCOVID-19 Protection and are interested in helping to trial implementationapproaches.20SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VEEducationFurther reopening of schools118 On 26 October 2021 Cabinet noted the Minister of Education was considering dproposals to increase face-to-face onsite education in Alert Level 3 areas andauthorised the Minister of Education and Associate Minister of Education (HoneJan Tinetti) to have Power to Act to take decisions on the proposals [CAB-21-MIN-0440 refers].s119 The Ministry of Education has undertaken consultation with primary schoolrepresentatives and there is support for managing student numbaers on-sitethrough an approach based on cohorts or groups of students attending ondifferent days. However, there is a wide range of schools weith diversecommunity circumstances, and any return to face-to-face learning will need toallow flexibility to recognise this.le120 In my capacity as Minister of Education I have raised the possibility of 15November as a date for Year 1 to 8 students to return to face-to-face learning.RHowever, current thinking is that a start date of 16 or 17 November would bemore likely to allow for schools to address the impact of requiring educationworkers to have first doses by 15 November.121 Moreover, as the public health risyk assessment notes, we have yet to seewhether the return to face-to-face learning for Year 11 to 13 students willresult in increased transmisslion. I am advised that an initial public health riskassessment will be availaeble by Thursday 4 November. I consider it prudent towait for this assessment before making a decision about timing.v122 I therefore propose to take this decision back to Cabinet on Monday 8November.itTiming of reopecning of Out of School Care and Recreation (OSCAR) programmes inAlert Level 3 areasa123 On 18 October Cabinet agreed to Out of School Care and Recreation(OSCAR) programmes reopening in Auckland alongside the reopening ofoschoolsand early learning services to all students, subject to the samevaccination and testing requirements and public health controls that apply tor schools and early learning services [CAB 21-MIN-0422 refers]. This decisionwas based on the ability to enable parents to return to work.P124 The opening of OSCAR programmes alongside schools may be difficult toalign initially. OSCAR programmes receive children from multiple classroomsand sometimes multiple schools. MSD will continue to work with the Ministryof Education and the Ministry of Health on appropriate timing to reopenOSCAR programmes with appropriate health controls.125 The decisions to have vaccination requirements extend to OSCARprogrammes as a condition of their opening have been maintained andcommunicated to OSCAR providers.21SEN SIT I VE9xf54yo3ur 2021-11-25 15:13:47SEN SIT I VEFinancial implications126 The high-level cost estimates for a scenario with Auckland at Alert Level 3and the rest of New Zealand at Alert Level 2 is $250-500 million5 for the WageSubsidy Scheme and approximately $200 million for the Resurgence Support dPayment.e127 The below table outlines the actual WSSAUG21 and RSPAUG21 paymentsmade to date, and updates the remaining appropriation balances.sWSSAUG21 and RSPAUG21 actual payments made and appropriation balancesaWSSAUG21 RSPAUG21Payments made $3,565 million6,7 $1,e178 millionAmount remaining in appropriations $557 million $1,672 million8leWage Subsidy Scheme August 2021R128 Applications for the fifth payment for the WSSAUG 21 close on Thursday 28October [CAB-21-MIN-0392 refers].

This Order provides for parts of Waikato that are in Alert Level 3 stage one to be movedsto Alert level 3 stage two [CAB-21-MIN-0407].2. On 1 November 2021, Cabinet agreed to move the relevant parts of Waikatoa to stage twoof the three stage Alert Level 3 reduction from 11.59pm on Tuesday, 2 November 2021[CAB-21-MIN-0450].e3. The Order is based on the most recent Alert Level 3 settings, adjusted by Cabinet decisionon 1 November 2021 [CAB-21-MIN-0450]. The Order includesl changes to revised AlertLevel 3 settings. e4. Stage two of the Waikato eased Alert Level 3 settings will permit:Ra) retail businesses to operate with face coverings for staff and customers and 2 metrephysical distancing requirements;b) public facilities including zoos, museumys and libraries can reopen, with face coveringsfor staff and customers and 2 metre physical distancing requirements;lc) increased controlled indoor gatherings (funerals, tangihanga and weddings) of up to 25epeople, plus staff; andd) increased outdoor gathevring limits of up to 25 people for any purpose.Retail businessesit5. While retail malls and shopping centres will be able to reopen at stage two, somecbusinesses and services within these malls and shopping centres will not be permitted toresume operations. For example, event facilities (including cinemas and theatres) andgyms withain malls and shopping centres must remain closed at stage two.6. Hospitality venues in retail malls and shopping centres (e.g. McDonalds) will be permittedoto reopen, but only for takeaways and these businesses must have systems andprocesses in place to prevent food and drink being served for consumption on therpremises.PIndoor public facilities7. Public facility is not defined in the Order. Instead, Schedule 6 provides examples of whatconstitutes an indoor public facility, including libraries, museums and zoos. Based on therisk profile of these settings and the practicality of wearing face coverings at them, at stagetwo:ALERT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS: AMENDMENT ORDER FOR SIGNING DPMC-2021/22-708DPMC: 4451581 Page 4 of 8IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEa) Libraries, museums and zoos should be permitted to reopen, with mandatory facecoverings for all people, record keeping for all people other than workers, and physicaldistancing (1 metre between workers, 2 metres between all other people) required.b) Indoor swimming pools, sport, recreation and leisure centres and exercise facilities (fordexample, gyms or boxing clubs) should not reopen. This is because face coverings areimpractical or less effective in most of these settings, making it harder to mitigatetransmission risk at these venues. eControlled indoor gatheringss8. Under Alert Level 3 stage one, controlled gatherings (funeral, tangihanga and weddings)are limited to a total of 10 people, excluding workers. It is proposed that thesea settings areamended to increase the gathering limit to 25 people, excluding workers. The newgathering limits will also apply to controlled gatherings for the purposes of viewing aetūpāpaku or deceased person.9. This requirement was agreed to by Cabinet on 4 October 2l021 as part of the initialproposal to introduce a three-stage process [CAB-21-MIN-0e407]. Transmission risk willbe mitigated by requiring attendees to remain physically distanced, with at least 2 metersbetween them.RIncreased outdoor social gathering limits10. At stage two, outdoor social gathering limits are increased from 10 to 25 people for anypurpose. At stage one, we mitigated the risk of gatherings by capping the number ofypeople to 10 people from up to two households. At stage two, there is no limitation on thenumber of households able to attend gatherings as long as it is limited to 25 people.le11. In practice, this will mean that at stage two 25 people will be permitted to gather outdoors,and these 25 people can come from up to 25 different households. Physical distancingwill not be mandatory butv will continue to be encouraged through the Unite AgainstCOVID-19 website.iPart 2: Moving Upper Northland to Alert Level 3tc12. Following two people in Kaitaia returning positive tests for COVID-19 on Monday1 November, on 2 November Ministers decided to move “Upper Northland” to Alert Levela3 – essentially the area north of a line between Hokianga Harbour and Kaeo on the eastcoast to Alert Level 3 from 11.59pm tonight (Tuesday 2 November), with a review of thesetotings by Cabinet on 8 November 2021.Public Health Risk Assessment and proposal regarding Alert LevelsrP13.A public health risk assessment (PHRA) was conducted on Tuesday 2 November, whichconcluded that while the risk of undetected community transmission in Northlandcontinues to be low, the risk around Kaitaia is low-medium due to the two unlinked caseswhere the source of infection is unknown.14. Based on this assessment, the PHRA recommended that the area around UpperNorthland move to Alert Level 3 for a period of five days starting at 11:59pm tonight toincentivise testing (and enable further vaccinations to take place).Permissions to cross the Alert Level boundaryALERT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS: AMENDMENT ORDER FOR SIGNING DPMC-2021/22-708DPMC: 4451581 Page 5 of 8IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCE15. Permitted travel between the Upper Northland Alert Level 3 area and Alert Level 2 areawill be the same as what is permitted currently into and out of Auckland (but without thetesting requirements).16. However, an additional permission is included to allow people to travel from the Alert Leveld2 area to the Upper Northland Alert Level 3 area and home again for any type of work. Notesting requirement would apply to this permission but evidence of a person’s permissionto travel would be required. These settings are consistent with the Waikato Alert Level 3esettings made on 3 October 2021.s17. New Zealand Police advise there are a small number of staff (about five) in the UpperNorthland area, with resources in the north focused on supporting the Northern AucklandAlert Level boundary. Therefore, enforcing compliance on any boundary ian addition toAuckland would be very difficult. They will, however, endeavour to work with thecommunity to encourage compliance where possible.eProcedural Requirements for a COVID-19 Act Orderle18. This proposed Order amends a COVID-19 Order, which you can do pursuant to sections11 and 15 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 (The Act). The Act imposescertain requirements for the form, publication and makRing of COVID-19 Orders. You mustbe sure that these requirements have been complied with before making a COVID-19Order.48 Hour Notification Periody19. The Act requires that a COVID-19 Order must be published and gazetted at least 48 hoursbefore it comes into force. Howevelr, this notice period is not required to be observedwhere you are satisfied that thee Order should come into force urgently to prevent orcontain the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 or where the effect of the Order is only toremove or reduce requirements imposed by a COVID-19 Order.v20. The Amendment Order provides for more permissive settings within the Waikato region.iThe 48-hour notice period does not need to be observed with respect to thesetamendments.c21. In the instance of Upper Northland, all these proposed amendments create additionalrestrictionas. We consider that in order for these amendments to be effective measures tolimit the spread of COVID-19, they should be applied immediately.oMinisterial Consultation22r. The Act requires that before making a COVID-19 Order, you must consult with the PrimeMinister, the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Health. You may also consult with anyPother Minister you think fit.23. Ministerial consultation in relation to:a) the step down to stage two of Alert Level 3 in Waikato was undertaken through theCabinet decision making process on 1 November 2021 [CAB-21-MIN-0450]; andb) moving Upper Northland to Alert Level 3 was undertaken through the Ministerialdecision that included the relevant Ministers.ALERT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS: AMENDMENT ORDER FOR SIGNING DPMC-2021/22-708DPMC: 4451581 Page 6 of 8IN CONFIDENCEIN CONFIDENCEPublic Health Advice24. The Act requires that before making a COVID-19 Order, you must have had regard toadvice from the Director-General of Health about the risks of the outbreak or spread ofCOVID-19 and the nature and extent of measures (whether voluntary or enforceable) thatdare appropriate to address those risks.25. Public health advice was provided in relation to Waikato through the Cabinet decisionemaking process on 1 November 2021 [CAB-21-MIN-0450]. The public health riskassessment concluded that given the nature of the outbreak in Waikato, it is consideredsproportionate to move to Alert Level 3 stage 2 with the above restrictions in place.26. Public health advice in relation to the Upper Northland area was providaed orally toMinisters and is summarised in paragraph 13.eNew Zealand Bill of Rights Act 199027. Section 9(2)(h) leR28.

This Order provides for the Auckland region that is currently in Alert Level 3 stage one tobe moved to Alert level 3 stage two.le2. On 8 November 2021, Cabinet agreed to move the Auckland region to stage two of thethree stage Alert Level 3 reduction from 11.59pm Tuesday 9 November 2021 [CAB-21-MIN-0463 refers]. R3. The Order is based on the most recent Alert Level 3 settings which moved the WaikatoAlert Level 3 area to Alert Level 3 stage two o n 2 November [DPMC-2021/22-708 refers],confirmed by Cabinet decision on 8 November 2021 [CAB-21-MIN-0463 refers].y4. Stage two of the Alert Level 3 settings will:lea) permit retail businesses to operate with face coverings required for staff and customersand 2 metre physical distancing requirements;vb) permit public facilities including zoos, museums and libraries can reopen (but notswimming pools or recreation centres), with face coverings for staff and customers andi2 metre physical distancing requirements;tc) increase conctrolled indoor gathering (funerals, tangihanga and weddings) limits to 25people (plus staff); andad) increase outdoor gathering limits to 25 people for any purpose.Retail bousinesses at stage two5. While retail malls and shopping centres will be able to reopen at stage two, somerbusinessesand services within these malls and shopping centres will not be permitted toP resume operations. For example, event facilities (including cinemas and theatres) andgyms within malls and shopping centres, must remain closed at stage two.6. Hospitality venues in retail malls and shopping centres (e.g. McDonalds) will be permittedto reopen, but only for takeaways and these businesses must have systems andprocesses in place to prevent food and drink being served for consumption on thepremises.ALERT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS AMENDMENT ORDER FOR SIGNING - COVID-19 DPMC-PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE (ALERT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS) ORDER (NO 12) 2021/22-780AMENDMENT ORDER (NO 13) 20214454107 Page 3 of 6[IN-CONFIDENCE][IN-CONFIDENCE]Indoor public facilities at stage two7. Public facility is not defined in the Order. Instead, Schedule 6 provides examples of whatconstitutes an indoor public facility, including libraries, museums and zoos. Based on therisk profile of these settings and the practicality of wearing face coverings at them, at stagedtwo:a) Libraries, museums and zoos should be permitted to reopen, with mandatory faceecoverings for all people, record keeping for all people other than workers, and physicaldistancing (1 metre between workers, 2 metres between all other people) required.sb) Indoor swimming pools, sport, recreation and leisure centres and exercise facilitiesashould not reopen. This is because face coverings are impractical or less effective inmost of these settings, making it harder to mitigate transmission risk at these venues.e8. Cabinet confirmed these settings on 8 November [CAB-21-MIN-0463 refers].lControlled indoor gatherings at stage twoe9. Under Alert Level 3 stage one, controlled gatherings (funeral, tangihanga and weddings)are limited to a total of 10 people, excluding workers. ItR is proposed that these settings areamended to increase the gathering limit to 25 people, excluding workers. The newgathering limits will also apply to controlled gatherings for the purposes of viewing atūpāpaku or deceased person.y10. This requirement was agreed to by Cabinet on 4 October 2021 as part of the initialproposal to introduce a three-stage step down of Alert Level 3 settings [CAB-21-MIN-l0407]. Transmission risk will be mitigated by requiring attendees to remain physicallyedistanced, with at least 2 meters between them.Increased outdoor social gathering limits at stage 2v11. At stage two, outdoor social gathering limits are increased from 10 to 25 people for anypurpose. At stage onie, we mitigated the risk of gatherings by capping the number ofpeople to 10 from tup to two households. At stage two, there is no limit on the number ofhouseholds ablce to attend gatherings as long as it is limited to 25 people.12. In practice, this will mean that at stage two 25 people will be permitted to gather outdoors,aand these 25 people can come from up to 25 different households. Physical distancingwill not be mandatory but will continue to be encouraged through the Unite AgainstCOoVID-19 website.Other amendmentsr13.The Order includes two minor technical amendments to fix cross-referencing errors.PProceduralRequirements for a COVID-19 Order14. This proposed Order amends a COVID-19 Order, which you can do pursuant to sections11 and 15 of the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 (the Act). The Act imposescertain requirements for the form, publication and making of COVID-19 Orders. You mustbe sure that these requirements have been complied with before making a COVID-19Order.ALERT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS AMENDMENT ORDER FOR SIGNING - COVID-19 DPMC-PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE (ALERT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS) ORDER (NO 12) 2021/22-780AMENDMENT ORDER (NO 13) 20214454107 Page 4 of 6[IN-CONFIDENCE][IN-CONFIDENCE]48 Hour Notification Period15. The Act requires that a COVID-19 Order must be published and gazetted at least 48 hoursbefore it comes into force. However, this notice period is not required to be observedwhere you are satisfied that the Order should come into force urgently to prevent ordcontain the outbreak or spread of COVID-19 or where the effect of the Order is only toremove or reduce requirements imposed by a COVID-19 Order.e16. The Order gives effect to a lessening of restrictions and therefore the 48 hours’ noticeperiod is not required, and this Order can come into effect immediately.sMinisterial consultationa17. The Act requires that before making a COVID-19 Order, you must consult with the PrimeMinister, the Minister of Justice and the Minister of Health. You may also consult with anyeother Minister you think fit.18. Ministerial consultation in relation to moving Auckland to Alelrt Level 3 stage two wasundertaken through the Cabinet decision making process one 8 November 2021 [CAB-21-MIN-0463 refers].RPublic Health Advice19. The Act requires that before making a COVID-19 order, you must have had regard toadvice from the Director-General of Health about the risks of the outbreak or spread ofCOVID-19 and the nature and extent of meyasures (whether voluntary or enforceable) thatare appropriate to address those risks.l20.

The scale and complexity of the response includes strategy and policy, system readiness andplanning, insights and reporting, risk and assurance, and communications and engagement.Costs associated with the delivery of these functions are primarily staff costs, except for thecommunications and public engagement delivery budget. The COVID-19 group as a whole dcomprises around 80 FTE, a mix of secondees and fixed term employees.e7. Full year funding will enable the retention of critical skills in a tight labour market, and anythingshorter or phased will make this challenging. Funding certainty and stability has beensrecommended in previous reviews of the all of government response.8. Contracts can be set up in ways that allow for reduction or ceasing of saome activities ifrequired, with any unspent funding being returned to the Crown as a no-regrets option.e9. The communications and engagement budget for 2022/23 including staff costs is $21.00million. $17.00 million is allocated to campaign, communications and engagement activities.lThis enables the following deliverables:ea. Development and maintenance of the Unite Against COVID-19 website and supportingplatforms ($0.700 million). Rb. Translation of key messages into 26 languages and five alternate formats ($0.800 million).c. Printing of materials to support public information – including COVID-19 tracer booklet,yposters, marae guidance ($0.800 million).ld. Development of creative materials to ensure clear public information on the COVID-19eresponse and the actions people need to take and when ($3 million).e. Paid media - buying mediva for advertisements for television, radio, billboards, newspapersand digital ($9 million).if. Research to provtide insights on public sentiment to ensure communications are effectiveand reach all pcarts of the community ($0.300).g. Other beaspoke communications and campaigns, such as ‘disruptive’ messages to thosetravelling where arrangements have changed, and event activations. Tailored messagesto specific groups and communities ($2.400 million).o10. Clemenger (creative agency) and OMD (media buying agency) have been the agencies usedrby the National Response and subsequently DPMC since March 2020 and these agency costsare part of the advertising budget. They were initially awarded the work under emergencyPprocurementand were re-contracted in May this year through a robust RFP process led byan independent procurement specialist. Contracts are in place until the end of the 2021/22Financial Year and an appropriate contestable process would be run ahead of any newcontracts.11. Both Clemenger and OMD work with other specialist agencies including Bright Sunday(Pacific), Bananaworks (Asian), Collenso (event activations) and advertising productionagencies which provide specialist advice and delivery. These agencies are contracted throughClemenger or OMD or separately, depending on the requirement or length of engagement.12. We have also contracted Iwi Communications Collective to work closely with Clemenger toensure effective communications with iwi/Maori.DPMC: 4457316 Page 2 of 4IN CONFIDENCEdesaeleRylevitcaorP"

EAlignment with Government PrioritiesL2 This paper concerns the Government’s response to COVID-19.ESummaryR3 At our meeting on 18 October, Cabinet agreed to shift our approach formanaging COVID-19 from an elimination strategy to an approach based onminimisation and protection, and to use the COVID-19 Protection FrameworkY(the Framework) to give effect to that new strategy. We also agreed thatAuckland would move to the new Framework when each Auckland DistrictLHealth Board (DHB) had reached 90% full vaccination of those eligible, andthe rest of the country would move when each DHB outside Auckland hadEreached the same target.V4 Auckland DHBs are at 90% first dose and are projected to reach 90% seconddose for vaccination coverage in mid-December. Some other DHBs are atsimilar levels. HoIwever, others will not reach that target until late December orTin the new year.5 The high vCaccination rates in Auckland, and around the country, mean that itis an appropriate time to change our approach at the Auckland boundary.ResAtriction on travel between regions is not intended to be a long-term part ofthe Framework, though has been helpful to slow the spread of COVID-19around the country. As vaccination levels have risen in other parts of NewOZealand,we can now change our management of the Auckland boundary. Wewill continue to use measures to help slow movement, but also ensure theR rest of New Zealand is prepared for spread.6 The Framework is designed to manage COVID-19 as part of our minimisationPand protection strategy. It allows a greater level of freedom for vaccinatedpeople than would be possible under the Alert Level system, and so reducesthe social and economic burden of public health restrictions. It provides thetools, with public health measures and COVID-19 vaccine certificates (CVCs),to manage the higher public health risk to, and from, unvaccinated people.Action is well underway on key elements for transitioning into the Framework11chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCE(for example, on CVCs, on changes to testing and isolation systems, onwelfare and support arrangements, and on sector guidance).7 Given Auckland’s high vaccination rates, we expect to move the Aucklandregion to the new Framework in the week beginning 29 November. CabinetDwill consider this move for Auckland to the Framework at its meeting onMonday 29 November, and at the same time we will consider options forEmoving the rest of the country into the new Framework.8 As part of the expected move to the Framework, the Auckland boundary Ssettings will continue to apply for a short period only. Consistent with ourminimisation and protection strategy, we need to do the following thAings whenwe change the boundary settings around Auckland in order to minimiseserious harm from the likely spread of COVID-19 throughout tEhe country, andprotect the most vulnerable:L8.1 Change the focus of our efforts from locking down Auckland toproviding stronger protection measures for the most vulnerableEareas of the country – This means continuing our vaccination effortsin these areas and engaging with local communities. Further, moving toRthe Framework will provide greater protection for more vulnerablecommunities with lower vaccination rates.Y8.2 Make sure that everyone is prepared for the management ofCOVID-19 cases – We alLl have a part to play here – government,including health and social services, local communities, iwi, hapū,whānau, businesses Eand individuals. We need to strengthen ourmessaging to people about what they can do to get ready and to lowertheir risk. PaperVs coming to Cabinet over the next two weeks on casemanagement and social supports in the community will help with that.Modelling Ito help local areas understand the expected risk of casesseedingT in their local areas, and the expected transmission dynamics intheir area once an initial small cluster has been seeded, will also beproCduced.9 In addition, as a short-term transitional measure, we could place restrictionsAon who can leave Auckland. While people will be able to leave for any reason,we are seeking Cabinet’s consideration of whether they should be vaccinatedOortested. This could be enforced through spot checking near the Aucklandboundary, where practical. A requirement would help in reducing the spreadR of cases from Auckland to vulnerable areas, both through raising awarenessof responsible behaviour in the travelling public (i.e. don’t travel if you pose arisk), and as a deterrent to irresponsible behaviour.P10 s9(2)(f)(iv), s9(2)(g)(i)21chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEs9(2)(f)(iv), s9(2)(g)(i)IntroductionD11 On 18 October Cabinet agreed to a minimisation and protection approach andto use the COVID-19 Protection Framework for New Zealand’s domesticresponse. Cabinet invited the Minister for COVID-19 Response to report back Eto Cabinet with a progress report on transition plans and any fundingimplications on 15 November 2021, and subsequently with a full plan in laSteNovember or early December before implementation. [CAB-21-MIN-0421]A12 This paper fulfils that progress report back. There are no funding implicationsin this paper; these are being addressed in issue-specific papers beingEconsidered in the coming weeks.13 The paper has two sections: L13.1 Updates on the implementation of the FrameEwork; and13.2 Decisions on the Auckland boundary.RUpdate on COVID-19 Protection Framework Implementation14 The implementation of the Framework is being coordinated centrally byYDPMC and operationalised by relevant agencies. Governance of theimplementation programme will be through the COVID-19 Chief ExecutivesLBoard (CCB). A temporary role has been created within DPMC to oversee thiswork, reporting to the Chair of the CCB. An overview of the workstreamsEunderway is provided in Appendix One and further updates will be provided toCabinet on 22 November and 29 November.V15 Sector guidance is being developed by the relevant agency for each sector,co-ordinated by DIPMC, and will be ready for publication the week startingT22 November. Sectors covered are:15.1 EduCcation (ECE, schools, tertiary);15.2 Transport (including public transport);A15.3 Hospitality;O15.4Workplaces;R 15.5 Events;15.6 Healthcare;P15.7 Primary sector;15.8 Social services;15.9 Local government;15.10 Public facing government agencies;31chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCE15.11 Justice sector;15.12 Religious venues;15.13 Māori-led responses; andD15.14 Sports.EUpdate on testing, contact tracing and case management16 The Ministry of Health are updating testing, tracing and case managemenStstrategies for use under the COVID-19 Protection Framework. A series ofpapers will be considered at the Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee onA17 November outlining key changes in COVID-19 testing, contact tracing,case management and home isolation that will support the transition to theEminimisation and protection approach and the Framework.17 The new COVID-19 Testing Strategy is expected to be fiLnalised by 22November. Work is also underway to expand the use of Rapid AntigenETesting, where appropriate, including a current trial with businesses. TheMinistry has recently publicly released the first iteration of Managing COVID-19 in the Community Operating Guidelines thaRt looks to provide centralguidance on the establishment of regionally delivered and locally led systemswhich provide both clinical and welfare a nd wellbeing support to people in thecommunity. The aim is to ensure that YCOVID-19 positive people and whānaureceive the support they need.LCVCs18 Ministry of Health officials aEre working to progress the delivery of CVCs tovaccinated people (and the limited group who are unable to be vaccinated formedical reasons) and Vthe CVC verifier app. The primary legislation and ordersto enable this will be in place by 30 November. The domestic My COVID Passwill be available oIn 15 November, with a pilot of the verifier app ready from 22TNovember, followed by general release on 1 December.Infringements, enCforcement, and compliance19 Officials are considering how the COVID-19 infringements regime will applywithAin the COVID-19 Protection Framework. A principled approach to theinfringement regime will help to inform our compliance approach, which willOhave operational impacts on the police and other enforcement officers. Aspart of this work, officials are also considering the question of liability acrossdifferent settings within the Framework.R20Police have advised they will continue to apply the Graduated ResponseP Model: Engage, Encourage, Educate and Enforce (4Es):20.1 Police advise that education will be the primary focus, unless there iswilful or intentional breach of the requirement.20.2 If widespread non-compliance occurred, creating a significant publichealth risk, Police advise they would apply the Graduated ResponseModel at a population level. This would involve clear encouragement41chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEand education to the public, followed by rapid escalation toenforcement action for all non-compliant individuals, where there isevidence of a breach.21 We must acknowledge that enforcement activity will be influenced by theDcapacity of Police and other agencies. Summer is already a time of increasedpressure for Police and enforcement agencies, and Police anticipate thatEmany staff will expect to be able to use their accrued leave (Police currentlyhas a large leave liability) this summer.SUse of localised lockdownsA22 Under the Framework localised lockdowns could be used over the top of othermeasures. We propose such lockdowns are targeted to areas with high ratesEof transmission. Localised lockdowns will not be one size fits all, and thesettings within them will vary by location, as required to best protect affectedLcommunities within our minimise and protect strategy. This will also provideus with opportunity to directly engage with affected communities and keyEstakeholders, including iwi and RLGs, in the development and implementationof lockdowns Such engagement may also provide opportunity for us toRproactively leverage community-led action.23 This means that localised lockdowns ma y look different to the Alert Level 3and 4 lockdowns previously experiencYed by New Zealanders. Localisedlockdowns will employ the combination of tools proportionate to the responserequired in the affected area. TheLse controls may include:23.1 stay at home orders;E23.2 closure of premises, e.g. schools and retail;V23.3 restrictions on gatherings; andI23.4 restrictions on movement in and out of the lockdown area.T24 Our current expectation is that the default option for localised lockdowns isCthat they will apply at the city or town level within a Red region. These wouldbe given effect through section 11 COVID-19 Public Health Response Act202A0 Orders, which specified Ministers are consulted on prior to being madeby the Minister for COVID-19 Response. In exceptional circumstances, hyper-Olocalised lockdowns or movement restrictions that apply to a sub-section of acity or town may be considered.RDecision making under the Framework25 Cabinet will decide whether shifts between levels should be made, which willPbe informed by public health advice. Shifts will be given effect to by theMinister for COVID-19 Response making Orders under the COVID-19 PublicHealth Response Act 2020. On 18 October, Cabinet approved changes to thefactors upon which decisions would be made [CAB-21-MIN-0421]. Next year,a regular cycle of fortnightly reviews could be established, with urgentdecisions in between if required. We will want to make clear that changes upand down levels will be less frequent under the Framework. Given changes51chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEbetween levels relate to pressure on the health system, there should be fewerchanges and longer lead-in times for changes in levels.26 There will be a need for more local input into decision making under theFramework. In particular, this input will be required when making decisionsDabout lockdowns in different regions, and the potential associated use ofboundaries. Local advice would inform what is feasible to implement.E27 We propose that officials develop a process to include input from RegionalLeadership Groups (RLGs), local government and iwi with respect to Sdecisions on shifts in level or lockdowns. The Minister for COVID-19Response will report back to Cabinet on 22 November with more deAtailedproposals for this process. These could have funding implications becauseRLGs are currently unfunded. We will also provide informationE on how healthsystem capacity considerations and public health risk assessments will informdecisions related to lockdowns.LOther Settings within the FrameworkE28 Officials will seek necessary policy decisions on settings within theFramework from Ministers with Power to Act aRnd other relevant portfolioMinisters in the week beginning 15 November, and we will provide an updateon the settings to Cabinet on 22 November. Key issues currently underconsideration include settings for events, including Specified OutdoorYCommunity Events, sports, and gathering limits for groups includingunvaccinated at Red.L29 In addition to being informed by engagement with key stakeholders, expertsEand Iwi, the Framework policy settings will use current Alert Level frameworksettings where practicable. For example, we anticipate the current exemptionsVlisted within the COVID-19 Health Response (Alert Level Requirements)Order (No 12) 2021 will also apply to the Framework.IEngagement with Iwi T30 Initial engagement has occurred with the Pandemic Response Group of theCIwi Chairs Forum where DPMC proposed engagement occur across fivekaupapa:A30.1 iwi involvement in local decision making under the Framework;O30.2how would local lockdowns work;30.3 guidance produced by different agencies;R30.4 what we do in areas that do not reach 90% vaccination coverage; andP30.5 transition from the Alert Level framework to the Framework.31 The Pandemic Response Group will respond shortly on these kaupapa andfurther engagement will follow. They also raised concerns with immediatewelfare needs of communities affected by COVID which officials areaddressing.61chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEEngagement with Advisory Groups32 Ministers and DPMC will be engaging with the COVID-19 IndependentContinuous Review, Improvement and Advice Group and the StrategicCOVID-19 Public Health Advisory Group on the phased approach to shiftingDAuckland, followed by the rest of New Zealand, to the Framework. DPMC willalso engage with the Community Panel in relation to the implementation of theEFramework.Transitioning Auckland and the rest of New Zealand to the COVID-19 SProtection FrameworkAMoving Auckland to the COVID-19 Protection Framework33 Cabinet agreed in principle, and it was subsequently confirmed by MinistersEwith Power to Act, that Auckland would move to the new Framework wheneach Auckland DHB had reached 90% full vaccination of those eligible. [CAB-L21-MIN-0421] We have also signalled that we would be pragmatic about ourdecision, not necessarily waiting until all three are over 90%.E34 In early December, full vaccination rates are projected to be 86% for CountiesRManukau, 89% for Waitematā, and 92% for Auckland. All three AucklandDHBs are currently on track to reach 90% full vaccination of their eligiblepopulations in mid-December. Updated p rojections for when DHBs will reach90% first and second doses are in AppYendix Two.35 Based on these projections, andL subject to public health advice, we expectAuckland to transition to the Framework in the week beginning 29 November,marking three weeks since Eall three DHBs reached 90% first doses. IfAuckland moved to the Red level, this would represent a shift down inrestrictions for vaccinaVted people, but a small step up for the unvaccinated.136 The vaccination rates in Auckland also mean that we can make changes toIthe Auckland boundary, to allow for more travel over the summer holidayTperiod. This decision is considered in paragraphs 44-58 below. This willincrease the rate of spread to areas outside of Auckland, so we need toCconsider the best approach to managing further spread to other regions.Moving theA rest of New Zealand to the COVID-19 Protection Framework37 We consider shifting the rest of New Zealand to the COVID-19 ProtectionOFrameworkprior to the changes at the Auckland boundary would position usmost strongly to manage the impacts of increased transmission of COVID-19.R Key to this is our proposal that we flip our current approach to thinking aboutusing lockdowns and boundaries to limit transmission and keeping the viruswithin a certain area, to using measures to keep it out of vulnerable regionsPwhile they increase their vaccination rates and build their capacity to respond.38 With Aucklanders being able to more easily travel around the country, the riskof the virus spreading outside Auckland is increased. If at this time, the rest of1 Under current Red settings, moving from stage 2 of Alert Level 3, the only change for theunvaccinated will be lower caps for outdoor and controlled gatherings that will go from 25 to 10.71chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEthe country was still using the Alert Level system, it would not beproportionate to move regions with no cases up Alert Levels as aprecautionary measure. This is because the restrictions under higher AlertLevels are too severe and do not differentiate between vaccinated andunvaccinated people. D39 Moving the whole country to the Framework would allow a more pre-emptiveEand precautionary approach to be taken in vulnerable regions. Earlyengagement has occurred with Northland stakeholders on this, and will beSundertaken more widely in coming weeks. Rather than just focussing on casenumbers, the Framework takes into account such things as vaccination ratesAand health system readiness in determining the appropriate level ofrestrictions to apply in a region. The Framework places limits on whatunvaccinated people can do, particularly in higher risk settingsE and at higherlevels of the Framework. It also allows greater freedoms for vaccinated peoplethan is possible under the Alert Level system, and so redLuces the social andeconomic burden of public health restrictions.E40 We have time now to lift our preparedness in these more vulnerable regions.Vaccination is our greatest protection from COVID-19 and we need toRcontinue to lift vaccination rates. Additional funding is being provided to Māorihealth providers in these regions, and DHBs are continuing their push toincrease vaccination rates.Y41 We also need to strengthen our messaging to people about what they can doLto get ready and to lower their risk. Papers coming to Cabinet over the nexttwo weeks on case management and social supports in the community willEhelp with that. Modelling to help local areas understand the expected risk ofcases seeding in their local areas, and the expected transmission dynamics inVtheir area once an initial small cluster has been seeded, will also beproduced.I42 A further benefTit of moving the rest of New Zealand to the Framework is that itwould simplify our response. We understand that there are significantcomplexitCies running multiple systems across the country if there are activecases outside of Auckland, including for the coherence of ourcomAmunications. It could be manageable for a short time, which would havethe benefit of giving the public more time to prepare for the transition, butusing a single system, especially as people travel during the summer periodOwillsimplify the understanding of our response for people. Also, importantlyfor our social cohesion, it will reduce perceived disparities in treatment ofRregions with similar vaccination rates, or the sense that some regions arebeing held up by others.P43 On 29 November we will bring a decision paper to Cabinet for Auckland’smove to the Framework, and at the same time will consider advice on timingfor the rest of New Zealand to move to the new Framework. The timing of thispaper will provide opportunity for further engagement and preparedness workto be facilitated by Ministers and officials, to ensure that sectors andcommunities are well placed to transition when needed.81chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEThe Auckland Alert Level boundary and future protective boundaries44 The high vaccination rates in Auckland, and the expected move to theFramework, mean that it is an appropriate time to change our approach at theAuckland boundary. Restrictions on travel between regions are not intendedDto be a long-term part of the Framework, though have been helpful to slow themovement of COVID-19 around the country. As vaccination levels have risenEin other parts of New Zealand, we can now make a change.45 We propose to change the management of the Auckland boundary on 15SDecember. This date coincides with school holidays, allows more time forvaccination rates across New Zealand to lift, and allows pre-ChristmAas travelto be spread across nine days.E46 The Ministry of Transport estimates that the number of people travelling out ofAuckland Airport could be between 7,000 to 10,000 each day in December,including transiting passengers, and 60,000 to 70,000 eaLch day by road.These numbers make the current high level of compliance checking at theEhard road boundary impractical and would lead to delays of over eight hours.47 For the air boundary, most but not all air traveRllers will be captured by Air NewZealand’s recently announced measures. From 14 December, for an initialperiod until 31 March 2022, only vaccinated or tested people over the age of12 can travel on their services. Jetstar is investigating how it could integrateYvaccination status into its booking systems, should Government require it as acondition of travel out of Auckland. The maritime boundary is currently notLenforced and it is not practical to do so.E48 Given the current outbreak in Auckland, and that having more Aucklanderstravelling is likely to spread the virus, we have considered whether thereVshould be requirements for people leaving Auckland. In a similar way to howrisks are managed at the international border, risk mitigations can beIconsidered for travellers departing Auckland for the rest of the country as aTway of limiting the rate of exposures outside of Auckland.COptions49 We have identified two options for changing the management of the boundaryAaround Auckland, both of which would apply from 15 December. Under bothoptions, people would be able to travel for any reason and the currentOexemption process would end:49.1 Retaining restrictions on travel out of Auckland and require all people2Rleaving for any reason by air, land or sea to be vaccinated, or have anegative test result, for a transitional period until 11.59pm Sunday 9P January.32 This requirement would apply to all people over the age of 12 years and 3 months - consistent withthe requirement for CVCs.3 The standard exemption provision in the case of emergencies would apply.91chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCE49.2 allowing unrestricted travel by air, land or sea for all people (i.e. norequirement for vaccination or to have a negative test).50 Whether to apply vaccination and testing requirements requires carefulconsideration of various factors:D50.1 Modelling tells us that when vaccination rates are at 90%, up to 50% ofcases could be in vaccinated people, and 20 to 25% could be in the Eunder 12 population. This means that by testing unvaccinated over 12s,only around 25 to 30% of cases might be caught, even with very hSighcompliance rates.A50.2 The efficacy of the requirements are impacted by the difficulties ofcompliance monitoring and enforcement (discussed below) but whileE100% compliance cannot be achieved, the existence of a legalrequirement would mean a significant (but unquantifiable) number ofLpeople would comply.50.3 Workforce pressures and constraints on PolicEe and Waka Kotahi wouldbe exacerbated by any road boundary. For Police in particular, this willbe the holiday period, and road police pRresence will be required onroads and to provide support at events.50.4 s9(2)(h)YLEVITCA50.5 s9(2)(h)ORP51 s9(2)(g)(i)101chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEs9(2)(g)(i)D52 s9(2)(g)(i)ESAE53 Given the range of factors, we consider that a full discussion of both options isthe best approach. Regardless of which option we choose, communicationsLwill be important to strongly encourage people not to travel if they pose a risk(because they are unvaccinated or may have sympEtoms of the virus).54 We propose that if it is decided to require people leaving Auckland to beRvaccinated or have a negative test result, the existing surveillance testingregime (rather than a negative pre-departure test) should continue to apply toworkers crossing the boundary, but narro wed to only apply to those who areYnot vaccinated. We propose this regime also cease by 11.59pm Sunday 9January.L55 We note that more laboratory capacity to process symptomatic tests willbecome available once the Esurveillance testing regime and the more generalvaccination and testing requirement cease. In either case, requiring a pre-departure PCR test asV well as vaccination would increase the protection, butthe Ministry of Health officials advise that this would be unsustainable formore than a veryI limited time as demand for tests would overwhelm capacity.They also adviTse rapid antigen testing would not be suitable for use at theboundary, as testing would create significant delays if used at the boundary orbe too diffCicult to accurately link back to the right person.Compliance and enforcementA56 For some vulnerable regions it may be possible for Police to establishcheckpoints and monitor compliance if required. This may be the case withONorthlandwhere there is a particularly vulnerable community and likely highnumbers of Aucklanders travelling into the region. In such places we note iwiRmay want checkpoints to be established to protect their communities andcould partner with Police to provide necessary human resources.P57 We have been advised that the only feasible approach to enforcing thesetypes of requirements related to crossing boundaries will be spot checks, near(but not at) boundaries. Should we decide to impose a requirement officialswill provide further advice on the appropriate penalty (potentially a fine of$1000).111chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCE58 The Ministry of Transport advises that further analysis of the feasibility ofsample checking at boundary checkpoints exiting Auckland indicates that thiswould be extremely challenging to implement. This is due to the lane spacerequired to carry out compliance checks safely and efficiently. Waka KotahiDadvises that while sample checking options provide, theoretically, an ability tominimise delays to between one and three hours, in practice the layoutErequirements would require more space (i.e. continuous four lanes) than isavailable at all locations. Subject to further detailed site analysis, this option isSnot considered practical from a vehicle speed and safety perspective.Risks A59 Operating the Alert Level System and the COVID-19 Protection FrameworkEsimultaneously will be complex and likely confusing for many of the NewZealand public at a time when we are already facing diminishing social licenseLin some parts of New Zealand, and more protest activity. Minimising the timebetween transitioning Auckland and the rest of New Zealand to theEFramework, in combination with very clear public communication aboutdiffering or new requirements, will be our key mitigation.R60 There is concern that Māori will be disproportionately impacted from thespread of COVID-19. We need to work h ard to ensure that we uphold ourYTreaty obligations and ensure that intensive efforts continue to lift Māorivaccination rates before and after we transition. Further specific populationLimpacts are provided in subsequent sections of this paper.E61 It is possible that some regions may not want to receive Aucklanders, whichmay impact on social cohesion. Transitioning all New Zealand to theVframework soon after Auckland, and the vaccination or testing requirement onpeople leaving Auckland, should help to mitigate this risk.I62 Relying on spoTt checking as the key general mechanism for boundaryenforcement risks a less than desirable non-compliance detection rate, butnonetheleCss will incentivise responsible travelling. There is also a risk thatenforcement officers may unconsciously take a discriminatory approach tospotA checks.Next stepsO63 The Minister for COVID-19 Response will bring a paper to Cabinet on22 November to confirm key settings of the Framework. This paper will alsoRinclude further information on:P 63.1 the vulnerable areas in New Zealand that would likely need to bedesignated as Red within the Framework;63.2 the triggers for moving between red, orange and green;63.3 how health system capacity considerations and public health riskassessments will inform decisions related to lockdowns;121chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCE63.4 potential for greater regional input into decision making; and63.5 the estimated economic impact of the new Framework.64 On 29 November the Minister for COVID-19 Response and I will bring a paperDto Cabinet to seek a decision to move Auckland to the Framework and toconsider advice on timing for the rest of New Zealand to move to the newEFramework. This paper will also provide information on any outstandingimplementation details.S65 It would also be prudent for us to check in before Christmas. Accordingly, wepropose the Minister for COVID-19 Response provide an update to ACabineton Monday 13 December. That paper will also set out how decisions will bemade if required over the Christmas period. EFinancial ImplicationsL66 Any financial implications associated with the Framework will be dealt with inrelated Cabinet papers. ELegislative Implications R67 To give effect to the Framework, the Minister for COVID-19 Response willmake Orders under the COVID-19 Publi c Health Response Act 2020 Act,Yfollowing consultation with specified Ministers.L68 The infringement offence penalty framework will be set in regulations subjectto the passage of the COVID-19 Public Health Amendment Bill 2021, andEthen given effect to through Orders.VImpact Analysis69 The Treasury's RIegulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that theproposals in thTis Cabinet paper relating to transitioning to the new COVID-19Protection Framework are exempt from the requirement to provide aCRegulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that they are intended tomanage, mitigate, or alleviate the short-term impacts of a declared emergencyAevent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implementation of the policy isrequired urgently to be effective (making complete, robust and timely impactOanalysis unfeasible).Human RightsR70s9(2)(h)P131chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCE71 s9(2)(h)72 s9(2)(h) DESAE73 s9(2)(h)LERYTreaty of Waitangi AnalysisL74 Treaty principles require the Crown to do what is reasonable in thecircumstances and do not nEecessarily require the Crown to adopt a particularcourse of action. The Crown’s particular interests of relevance to theproposals in this paperV include the Crown’s duty to protect Māori healthequitably and actively and the Crown’s responsibility to address thedisproportionatelIy low vaccine uptake by Māori.T75 Current vaccination rates are lower for Māori, with current rates across thepopulationC at 76% first dose and 59% second dose. The moves that havebeen taken to control the outbreak strongly and quickly have been intended toprevent the spread of COVID-19 to all New Zealanders, including theseAvulnerable populations.76 OTransitioning all New Zealand to the Framework, rather than relying on theAlert Level system, will provide us with more proportionate options under theRed settings to protect vulnerable communities, and potentially to accelerateRvaccination rates. As such, the measures are intended to promote equity ofhealth outcomes within the Minimise and Protect context. We note, however,Pthat imposing restrictions to achieve better health outcomes could involveworse economic outcomes for vulnerable populations in the short term.77 In a context with increased COVID-19 management in the community, Māoriwill need to be involved in local and national decision-making as outlinedabove, and appropriately supported and funded to take a leading role inproviding community support. The engagement outlined in this paper with the141chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEIwi Chairs Forum Pandemic Response Group is an example of work at anational level.78 Phase 2 of the Māori Communities COVID-19 Fund can provide some of thissupport, and we expect relevant officials will continue to work together with DMāori partners to develop a framework that will support the role of Māori in thecommunity. EPopulation and economic impactsS79 On 18 October, Cabinet considered the impacts of the change in strategyfrom the Alert Level system to the Framework [CAB-21-MIN-0421 reAfers].These included the health impacts from further spread of COVID-19 in thecommunity and the impacts from measures used to suppress Ecases. Thispaper focuses on the impacts of opening the Auckland boundary andcontemplates moving the whole country before that time to the Framework.LHealth impacts of opening the Auckland boundaryE80 While vaccinations reduce the health impacts of the virus, they do noteliminate them. Vaccinated people can still geRt sick and spread the virus andAucklanders travelling will spread the virus. The impact of more people havingthe virus will have flow on effects into oth er areas of health, for example byreducing the health system’s capacity Yto deal with urgent or elective care.81 The virus has had a disproportionate health impact on Māori and PacificLcommunities. As well as making up a large proportion of cases to date, Māoriand Pacific peoples generally have higher rates of co-morbidities that result inEpoorer outcomes if they are infected with the virus. Younger Māori have someof the lowest vaccination rates, therefore are at higher risk of health impacts,Vand being excluded due to CVC requirements.82 Older people areI most at risk of hospitalisation and death with COVID-19 andTthere will be health impacts in this group, even with high vaccination rates. Inpeople aged under 12, who cannot be vaccinated, there is also some risk ofCimpact, and this age group is generally exempt from mask usage. There couldalso be impacts on disabled people who have had barriers to their access forAvaccination or could otherwise be unable to be vaccinated.83 The degree of undetected infection is the key factor for the risk of inter-Oregionaltransmission (detected cases are expected to stay at home and nottravel). The number of undetected infections is expected to increase with (inRabsolute terms, and as a proportion of) rising reported case numbers, asindividual case management, isolation and contact tracing performancesP weaken. By definition, the true extent of undetected infection in Auckland isnot known. Any loosening of the boundary with Auckland, coupled with highnumbers of reported cases in Auckland, would mean that we must expectinfected people to travel across New Zealand.84 Historical movement data can be used to provide insight on where people inAuckland typically go, including seasonal changes in movements patternsover the summer period. The regions that experience greater influxes of151chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEAucklanders include Northland, Waikato (particularly in the Thames-Coromandel district) and Bay of Plenty.85 In communities with lower rates of vaccination, transmission can be expectedto be quicker. This means that outbreaks would be larger at the point they areDdetected, and harder to contain once they are detected. As well asvaccination coverage, the rate of testing in a local area is a key factor in theEtime prior to detection, and, hence, the number of active cases at that point.Measures to mitigate the health risks of opening the Auckland boundary S86 To mitigate some of the negative health impacts of opening the boundary, thisApaper discusses identifying areas that may be particularly vulnerable to theopening of the Auckland boundary and putting in additional measures toEprotect these communities.87 For vulnerable communities inside the Auckland boundaLry, the Red Levelprotections will assist with reducing the impacts, along with continued effort toincrease vaccination rates for Māori in particular. EEconomic impacts of opening the Auckland boundary and introducing theRFramework88 The economic impact of the Framework is highly uncertain and Treasury willYprovide an estimate of the impact in the Cabinet paper on 22 November.There are likely positive economic impacts from allowing travel out ofLAuckland and the introduction of the Framework across New Zealand,depending on the levels in the area. There will be additional costs toEbusinesses implementing this new system.89 As we are consideringV a staggered transition to the Framework, the Ministerof Finance will report back to Cabinet on arrangements for deactivating theWage Subsidy. AI final universal payment under current settings for theResurgence SuTpport Payment would be made on 26 November. A targetedtransitional payment would likely be made on 10 December; Ministers are stillconsiderinCg the settings for this transitional payment.Social Impacts of introducing the FrameworkA90 Additional supports may be necessary for communities in the event ofOlocalised lockdowns, especially working poor households who may face asharp drop in employment income, and for households with limited socialsupport networks who will continue to be hardest hit by lockdowns.R91Transitioning to the Framework also has potential to impact on social license.P We have already seen protest activity from people who oppose vaccination,and/or mandatory vaccination requirements; as the principal impact from thechange to the new framework is the introduction of measures that depend onthe vaccination status of an individual it is possible that such activity mayincrease.92 The transition to the Framework also has potential to maintain and improveour social license. It is designed to create more certainty and stability in our161chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:48:32IN CONFIDENCEresponse, and is our best available option to proportionately manage thespread of COVID-19 in New Zealand. Sentiment research conducted inOctober found that people who were aware of the new Framework were morelikely to think we were ‘going in the right direction’.DImpacts on Pacific Island Countries93 This proposal has possible implications for Pacific countries, including those Ewith whom we have quarantine-free travel arrangements. Many of our Pacificpartners have remained cautious about travellers from New Zealand impoSrtingCOVID-19, and maintain strict border settings, including mandatory MIQ, tomitigate this risk. An increased risk of travellers contracting COVID AinNew Zealand may impact partners’ capacity and confidence to repatriatetravellers. E94 Early and clear communications with Pacific partners will be vital to explainLour policy changes and address any concerns. Officials will report to Ministersseparately on managing these implications.EConsultationR95 This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group in the Department of thePrime Minister and Cabinet.

This date allows sufficient time for any finaldrafting changes after our decisions and 48 hours’ notice of the order beforeVthe new Framework comes into effect.5 In October CabinIet agreed to take into account the following factors whenmaking decisioTns about moving between different levels of the Framework:5.1 Health factors: vaccination rates, health system capacity, testing andCcontact tracing capacity, and transmission, particularly in vulnerablepopulations; andA5.2 Non-health factors: effects on economy and society, impacts on at riskO populations, public attitudes, and operational considerations [CAB-21-MIN-0421 refers].R6 The Ministry of Health will assess the health factors, guided by the questionsset out in the table below, noting these are not exhaustive and will continue toP evolve over time:11chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCETable 2: Proposed questions to inform Framework levels for each regionKey questions to determine for each region employing a If yes, move to…one month horizonCan we no longer ‘minimise and protect’ effectively without LocalisedDlocalised restrictions and closures? restrictions andclosures• Is there a new variant of concern for which current vaccinesEin New Zealand have significantly reduced effectiveness at (equivalent of AL 3preventing severe illness hat is resistant to the vaccine? or 4; at a local, notSregional, level)• Are hospitalisations, ICU admissions (and/or deaths)predicted to increase substantially, to the point where theAhealth system will be overwhelmed?EAre there warning signs that a shift for a region to red is Redneeded to assure health system capacity remains sufficient?Action needed to protectL health system – system• Is demand on the health system (e.g. primary care,facing unsustainablehospitalisations, ICU admissions, testing, contact tracing) number of hospitalisations.Elikely to exceed capacity?Action needed to protect at-• Are we likely to see a rapid growth in hospitalisations or risk populations.1Rfatalities, particularly among the most vulnerable?OrangeYIs health system capacity beginning to come under pressure, Increasing communitytransmission with increasingso more restrictions are needed to help protect capacity?pressure on health system.L• Are case numbers likely to exceed capacity to manage in Whole of health system isone or more regions? focusing resources but canE manage.• Will the contact tracing or testing system come under strainIncreasing risk to at riskas a result of an outbreak in a given region?V populations• Will health capacity continue to be sufficient to meet GreenIhealthcare demand?

They willengage with primary care providers, DHBs, Māori, Pacific and other NGODhealthcare providers to improve the assessment tools and approach over thecoming week. This engagement will refine the assessment to inform decisionsEat Cabinet on 29 November on the initial level settings for the country.9 I propose these levels apply to regions, based on local government regioSnalboundaries. The public has a good understanding of these regions and theyrelate broadly to social and economic communities and patterns of tAravel.Generally, they are what we have used under the Alert Level framework.E10 I seek agreement to aspects of the settings in the Framework related toevents, gatherings, travel, and education.LIntroductionE11 On 18 October 2021, Cabinet agreed to move from an elimination strategy toa minimisation and protection approach. The Framework was agreed toRsupport this shift in approach to managing COVID-19 [CAB-21-MIN-0421].12 On 15 November, the Prime Minister and I reported back to Cabinet with anYupdate on the preparation for moving to the Framework, includingmanagement of the current Auckland Alert Level boundary. CabinetLauthorised Ministers with Power to Act to take decisions on detailed settingswithin the Framework and we agreed an approach to the Auckland Alert LevelEboundary. Current restrictions on movement across the boundary will beretained until Wednesday 15 December, with vaccination and testingVrequirements applying after that date until 11.59pm Sunday 16 January 2022[CAB-21-MIN-0477].I13 This paper hasT four sections:13.1 tranCsitioning to the Framework;13.2 decision-making under the Framework;A13.3 movement in and out of Red areas; andO13.4settings within the Framework.14 Today, we will consider several other papers that relate to our readiness toRtransition to the Framework, including:P 14.1 changes to COVID-19 testing, case investigation and contact tracingsystems and processes;14.2 advice on a whole of system welfare approach for people who needsupport to safely self-isolate in their homes; and14.3 the care in the community model to support COVID-19 patients, theirhouseholds and whānau to quarantine and isolate at home.31chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCE15 We are also making decisions today on our approach to Reconnecting NewZealanders. We increasingly need to think about our level of domestic andinternational risk together. Our differentiated approach to the treatment ofvaccinated and unvaccinated people will apply to both people entering NewZealand, and those within the country. D16 Cabinet will also shortly consider the proposed approach for economicEsupports under the Framework, including transitional support.17 Transitioning to the Framework means that everything we do, including Sinternational border settings, must align to our minimise and protect strategy.What this looks like in practice will differ across the country, tailoredA to theneeds of communities. For example, for vulnerable regions, increasing accessto health services, scaling up the capacity of health providers Eand reducingundetected transmission will be critical. In other regions our priorities will differ– such as having more of a focus on symptomatic testing. Looking across theLsuite of papers we are considering today, we need to be confident that wehave the right policies in place and implementation Ework underway.Transitioning to the FrameworkR18 On Wednesday 17 November the Prime Minister publicly announced how weplan to transition to the Framework:Y18.1 On 29 November, Cabinet would confirm when to transition the countryto the Framework. It was signalled that the whole country wouldLtransition soon after Cabinet meets, with Auckland and areas with lowvaccination rates initially moving to Red.E18.2 From Wednesday 15 December people will be permitted to cross theVAuckland Alert Level boundary for any reason. However, to mitigatetransmission risk, those people will be required to be either fullyIvaccinated or have a negative COVID-19 test 72 hours prior toTdeparting Auckland. This requirement is intended to be in place until17 January 2022. Officials will provide advice to the Minister forCCOVID-19 Response on the testing requirements for workers currentlypermitted to cross the boundary.3A19 I propose we formally confirm the decision to move the whole country to theFramework, and rescind our previous decisions about moving when we get toOthe90% vaccination target in each District Health Board (DHB). I note that atthe time Ministers with Power to Act agreed the settings for the Framework,Rthey also agreed to review the vaccination targets on 29 November 2021 aspart of the report back to Cabinet on the progress report on transitionP plans.[DPMC-2021/22-621]20 The proposed approach was tested with the COVID-19 Advisory Groupchairs, who recognised the imperatives for shifting the entire country into theFramework before Christmas 2021. Feedback included the importance of3 On 15 November Cabinet noted the need to consider the existing surveillance testing regime forworkers in the Auckland region ahead of removal of the boundary movement restriction, in particularwith a view to increasing laboratory capacity to process tests from symptomatic people and closecontacts. [CAB-21-MIN-0477]41chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCEcontinued incentives for vaccination, reducing the degree of spread,maintaining public health measures, ensuring the health system has capacity,and that resources are in the right places to support communities.21 The National Iwi Chairs Forum have expressed strong concerns about theDframework coming into force earlier than expected, spread of the virus byrelaxing the Auckland boundary, and the risks to Māori health givenEvaccination rates are lower for Māori compared to the average across NewZealand. The combination of these issues has left Māori worried about theSreadiness of their communities, particularly remote areas and low vaccinationareas. They are seeking strong involvement in regional decisions anAd actionsto prepare their communities.ETiming22 Although there are options about when we transition to the new Framework,Lofficials advise the best transition date is 11.59pm Thursday 2 December.Following final Cabinet decisions on Monday 29 NoEvember, I will receive adraft COVID-19 Protection Framework Order for approval and signature. It isintended the Order is gazetted by 11.59pm TuResday 30 November andpublicly available online for 48 hours before coming into effect at 11.59pmThursday 2 December. This date allows sufficient timing for any final draftingchanges after our decisions. It is also good practice to give people andYbusinesses at least two days to become familiar with the legal requirementsbefore it comes into effect.L23 Given this sequencing, I propose that we agree in principle, subject toEconfirmation on Monday 29 November, transitioning the whole country to theFramework at 11.59pm Thursday 2 December. This decision will be informedVby the health assessment criteria we are considering today. I propose that weannounce this date the week of 22 November.IUpdate on vaccinationT targets24 By the week of 29 November, it is projected that around 86% of the eligibleCpopulation will be double vaccinated. Auckland DHBs, Wellington DHBs,Canterbury and Southern DHBs are all expected to be at 86% or above.ALakes, West Coast, Whanganui, Northland and Tairāwhiti DHBs are projectedto be below 80%. However, the equivalent rates for Māori, are much lower, asOnoted in Appendix One.25 By the week of 13 December, when the Auckland boundary is disestablished,Rthe majority of DHBs are projected to be above 85%, and most are projectedto be above 90% by the end of the year. Updated projections are set out inP Appendix Two.Sector guidance26 Sector guidance has been developed by the relevant agency for each sector,co-ordinated by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC).The guidance will be published this week, providing reassurance and moreinformation about the implications of the Framework for each sector. Thesectors that are covered include:51chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCE26.1 Education (ECE, schools, tertiary);26.2 Transport operators (including public transport);D26.3 Hospitality;E26.4 Workplaces;26.5 Events; S26.6 Healthcare;A26.7 Primary sector;E26.8 Social services;L26.9 Local government;26.10 Public facing government agencies; E26.11 Justice sector;R26.12 Places of worship;26.13 Iwi/Māori; and Y26.14 Sports.L27 On 22 November DPMC will provide advice to the Minister for COVID-19EResponse outlining sector guidance plans across each sector and includingexamples of what is being produced on 22 November.VDecision-making under the FrameworkI28 On 18 October, Cabinet agreed that Ministers will continue to make decisionsTon regional and national levels within the Framework and that five healthfactors and four other factors will inform the decisions:C28.1 Health – vaccination rates, health system capacity, testing and contactA tracing capacity, and transmission, particularly in vulnerablepopulationsO28.2Non- Health – effects on economy and society, impacts on at riskpopulations, public attitudes, and operational considerations [CAB-21-R MIN-0421 refers].29 Indicative risk assessments and thresholds for movement within a region atPeach level of the Framework were also agreed by Cabinet, and will continueto be used to inform decision-making:29.1 at Green, case numbers are kept low through testing, contact tracingand quarantine, and hospitalisations at a manageable level;29.2 a shift to Orange would occur with increasing community transmission,increasing pressure on the health system, or increasing risk to at riskpopulations; and61chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCE29.3 a shift to Red would occur when Orange is no longer containing thevirus in the original outbreak areas, and action is needed to protect thehealthcare system, and the health of communities or at-risk populations[CAB-21-MIN-0421 refers].D30 We do not expect to be changing levels as frequently under the newFramework. I propose that for the first month or two, COVID-19 Ministers withEPower to Act meet fortnightly to assess the situation across the country.Gradually we will be able to shift to monthly assessments, unless triggeredSearlier, based, for example, on a data-validated request from a local orregional health authority that is subsequently approved by the Director-AGeneral of Health. (As Cabinet noted on 15 November, I will return to Cabinetwith proposals for decision making over the Christmas period Monday on13 December [CAB-21-MIN-0477].) E31 The Ministry of Health will produce a dashboard of key forward lookingLmetrics relevant to the Framework such as tracking vaccination rates indifferent regions and health system capacity and deEmand both regionally andoverall. The Director-General of Health will provide an assessment of thehealth factors. R32 DPMC will provide advice to Ministers on appropriate action, based on thehealth advice and other factors. DPMC w ill continue to consult relevantYagencies throughout the development of this advice, to determine how anyproposals are likely to impact vulnerable communities and to ensure otherLsocial and welfare considerations, including housing capacity, areincorporated.E33 Last week we agreed in principle that Regional Leadership Groups willprovide advice and recVommendations on local responses, subject to furtheradvice to be provided to Cabinet. Regional Leadership Groups include localgovernment, regiIonally-based officials from central agencies, and in somecases mana wThenua and community leaders. Many of these groups havebeen operating for many years (albeit under different mandates) and have therelationshCips and connections to galvanise and respond locally. The groupsinclude Regional Public Service Commissioners, who have the mandate toconvAene, resolve and escalate issues and to support the Crown in its regionalrelationships with Māori under the Treaty of Waitangi. Regional LeadershipGroups will contribute to advice on the non-health factors, from the regionalOperspective.They will oversee and support the coordination of locally-leddelivery of the health, welfare, housing and economic system approachesRunder the Framework. Where iwi are not part of Regional Leadership Groups,it is important we work to ensure that iwi have input into decision making inP those regions as appropriate.34 As we move into a regular cycle of check-ins on domestic level settings, wecan also check-in on our border settings through the same process. Adviceand decision-making on international border settings will need to beconsistent with our domestic level settings to reduce both health and legalrisks.71chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCEDetermining initial levels for the transition35 The Ministry of Health has made an initial assessment of levels for differentregions. The Ministry will be engaging with DHBs, iwi/Māori and other NGOhealthcare providers to improve the model over the coming week so a moreDrefined assessment can be discussed at Cabinet on 29 November. This willenable Health to incorporate important lead indicators into the model, such asEthe locations Aucklanders have historically travelled to over the summerholiday period and the impact of summer leave on the healthcare workforce.S36 On Monday 29 November, Cabinet will make final decisions about the levelsat which different regions of the country will enter the Framework. AA healthassessment, which will include an assessment of supply and demand inhealthcare services in the affected areas, will inform these decisions.EVulnerability will be a key consideration in determining which areas enter theFramework at Red. Social deprivation, distance to health services, vaccineLuptake, ethnicity and age will be assessed as indicators of vulnerability.E37 Protecting the most vulnerable communities is something we have clearlycommitted to under the new Framework. Greater freedoms for some shouldRnot be at the expense of heightened risk for those who are most vulnerable,particularly as the new system and support measures bed-in. Given this, thereis a strong case for a precautionary appr oach being taken to determininginitial levels for different regions. A preYcautionary approach, which would likelyinvolve greater restrictions on the rights and freedoms of those in vulnerablecommunities, will provide the necLessary protection while vaccination ratesincrease, and help to prevent any shifts up levels shortly after we transition tothe Framework. ECriteria for assessing movement between levelsV38 Once the country has transitioned to the Framework, we expect to use adifferently weightIed set of criteria to decide on any movement between levelsTwith greater emphasis on health system capacity. Extra health and welfaresupport will continue to be provided to vulnerable communities, regardless ofCthe level settings.39 BasAed on the health factors agreed by Cabinet noted in paragraph 28 above,the Ministry of Health has proposed a set of questions the Director-General ofHealth will consider when advising on the appropriate level for each region.OThesequestions will continue to evolve and improve over time.R Table 2: Proposed questions to inform Framework levels for each regionKey questions to determine for each region employing a If yes, move to…one month horizonPCan we no longer ‘minimise and protect’ effectively without Localisedlocalised restrictions and closures? restrictions andclosures• Is there a new variant of concern for which current vaccinesin New Zealand have significantly reduced effectiveness at (equivalent of AL 3preventing severe illness hat is resistant to the vaccine? or 4; at a local, notregional, level)81chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCE• Are hospitalisations, ICU admissions (and/or deaths)predicted to increase substantially, to the point where thehealth system will be overwhelmed?Are there warning signs that a shift for a region to red is Red Dneeded to assure health system capacity remains sufficient?Action needed to protecthealth system – system• Is demand on the health system (e.g. primary care, Efacing unsustainablehospitalisations, ICU admissions, testing, contact tracing) number of hospitalisations.likely to exceed capacity?Action needed to protSect at-• Are we likely to see a rapid growth in hospitalisations or risk populations.4fatalities, particularly among the most vulnerable?AOrangeEIs health system capacity beginning to come under pressure, Increasing communitytransmission with increasingso more restrictions are needed to help protect capacity?pressure on health system.L• Are case numbers likely to exceed capacity to manage in Whole of health system isone or more regions? focusing resources but canEmanage.• Will the contact tracing or testing system come under strainIncreasing risk to at riskas a result of an outbreak in a given region?R populations• Will health capacity continue to be sufficient to meet Greenhealthcare demand? (noting the ability to share resourcesCOVID-19 across NewYacross regions) Zealand, including sporadicimported cases.L Limited communitytransmission.E COVID-19 hospitalisationsare at a manageable level.Whole of health system isVready to respond.IT40 Consideration of these questions will be based on data and local knowledgeabout the health system capacity and capability to operate in view of theCevolving situation in each region or area. The data analysis will consider both‘demand’ (vaccination rates, COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations, welfare needsetc)A as well as ‘supply’ factors (capacity projections). Supply factors take intoaccount the health system’s capacity and capability to respond to COVID-19Oand to continue to deliver other critical health services. More work is neededto include ‘lead’ indicators into the analysis to give a better picture of the likelysituation in the future.RMovementin and out of Red areasP41 On 18 October Cabinet noted there will be no restrictions on interregionaltravel or internal boundaries under the Framework, except when a region is atRed or in the case of localised lockdowns [CAB-21-MIN-0421 refers].42 s9(2)(f)(iv)4 Cabinet previously agreed these risk assessments and thresholds for movement within a region ateach level of the Framework [CAB-21-MIN-0421 refers].91chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCEs9(2)(f)(iv)DE43 As we have further developed our thinking in relation to the Frameworkand decided how we will deal with the current Auckland boundary, we Sdonot propose imposing this requirement to other areas that are at Red whenwe move the country to the Framework. However, I recommend wAe agreethe vaccination or test requirement could be applied for travel both intoand/or out to Red areas in the future, if considered necessaEry (informed bypublic health advice at the time). Compliance and enforcement of theserequirements would depend on available resourcing anLd implementationpracticalities.E44 Movement restrictions will not be our default setting but could form part oflocalised lockdowns. The preference will be Rto use other levers to managelocalised risk.Settings within the Framework YRegions are proposed to be used for levels under the FrameworkL45 I propose that local government regional boundaries are the most appropriateto use under the COVID-19E Protection Framework. While vaccination andother health data relates to DHB areas – which are generally smaller thanregions – generally regVions are what we have used under the Alert Levelframework. Regional boundaries relate more naturally to social and economiccommunities (in tIerms of patterns of work, and movement) than DHB areas.DHBs frequentTly work together across administrative boundaries.46 Some regions contain several DHBs – e.g. the Auckland region includesCWaitemata, Counties Manukau and Auckland DHBs – whereas others haveonly one DHB such as Gisborne. In total there are 16 regions and 20 DHBs. IfAit were decided that parts of a region should be at different levels, it would bepossible to define smaller areas by in most cases using territorial authority orObespokeboundaries.47 The Ministry of Health considers that using DHB areas would be preferable toRregions because their analysis is based on DHB information. They wouldprefer agencies to confer further to agree the appropriate regional unit.PSettings for events and gatherings, including as these relate to sport48 Ahead of the transition to the Framework, it is necessary to confirm or adjustthe Framework policy settings for events and gatherings, including as theserelate to sport, to provide certainty for New Zealanders and ensureproportionality. It is urgent we do this now as sector guidance on theFramework is due to be published the week beginning 22 November. It is alsoimportant that New Zealanders clearly understand how events and gatherings101chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCEwill operate in the Framework – as many of these are a source of greatenjoyment, and we want to avoid confusion or disappointment.49 I propose that events and gatherings should operate under the settingsoutlined in the table below, and that the requirements specified apply Dregardless of the ‘settings’ in which the event or gathering occurs. This issupported by public health advice that a COVID-19 requirement that applies inErelation to a particular activity should apply to a business or service to theextent that the activity is carried out by the business or service. For examSple,this would mean that hospitality premises or public facilities hosting events orAgatherings would have to follow event or gathering requirements while doingso, although hospitality rules when eating and drinking at events wouldEcontinue to apply. Officials are working on defining an event on the basis of itbeing an activity (rather than have requirements attached to an ‘event facility’,Las currently occurs). Working definitions are provided in Appendix Three.50 In considering these proposals, is important that weE all understand howcapacity limits are intended to apply, which based on public health adviceincludes: R50.1 both the vaccinated and unvaccinated capacity limits specified in theFramework are inclusive of children, and those not able to beYvaccinated but who are entitled to COVID-19 Vaccination Certificates(CVCs) as these groups still pose a transmission risk.5 For theLavoidance of doubt the presence of children, who are not able to bevaccinated, does notE trigger the lower unvaccinated capacity limitrequirements;V50.2 vaccinated and unvaccinated capacity limits (including for gatherings)specified in the Framework are hard maximum caps, and mixed groupsIof vaccinated and unvaccinated people must adhere to theTunvaccinated capacity limit (rather than to the unvaccinated proportionof tChe group only); and50.3 specified vaccinated and unvaccinated capacity limits apply to allApeople within a ‘defined space’, excluding workers, unless there isexplicit provision otherwise.ORP5 CVCs will be known to the public as ‘My Vaccine Pass’.111chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCETable 3.

First, is how I propose to define andOmanageSpecified Outdoor Community Events, which is a category that hasnot been part of New Zealand’s COVID-19 Alert Level requirements. TheR Framework currently indicates that these events are allowed at Green andOrange, and at Red with a capacity limit. I propose that events that haveP uncontrolled entry (i.e. are open to the public) and take place outdoors shouldbe considered part of this category.52 Specifying these types of uncontrolled, outdoor events to be SpecifiedOutdoor Community Events will provide certainty for event organisers as tohow they are expected to operate. For proportionality across the Framework, Ipropose that these types of events should operate under the samerequirements as gatherings. If Specified Outdoor Community Events had121chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCElooser requirements than gatherings (or events, which have very similarrequirements), we would risk people ‘gaming’ the system, and self-identifyingas Specified Outdoor Community Events to benefit from lesser restrictions(which may increase public health risk), or would risk being in a positionwhere uncontrolled access events can operate under looser restrictions than Dcontrolled access events.E53 Second, for the avoidance of doubt, I consider that we should direct that alloutdoor community sport, unless that sport is operating under events rules,Sshould operate under gatherings rules. This would provide a clear home foroutdoor sport within the Framework. It is also a familiar way of operating forAsports activities (outdoor community sport operated under gatherings rulesunder the Alert Level system).E54 Related to this is my proposal that all capacity limits specified in theFramework apply to ‘defined spaces’, as they did under the Alert Level systemL– which means that there can be multiple defined spaces at one venue, indooror outdoor. For example, this could mean that multipEle games of touch rugbycould be played at one park. I note also that provided they are appropriatelydistanced from players, that spectators would Rnot be included within the ‘sport’gathering capacity limit. However, I do acknowledge that some communitysports operators may find adhering to capacity limits, or using CVCs, verydifficult, and that this may impact on the availability of these sports activities atYGreen, Red, and Orange unless alternative ways of operating are developed.L55 I acknowledge that some commercial and community events that use CVCswill not be able to go ahead under Red with the limit of 100, including eventsElike major concerts and festivals. The proposed settings mean that events likeSanta Parades would be unlikely to go ahead. Officials have also advised thatVthe risk of red restrictions coming into place will mean that some events willcancel now, rather than incur costs in the lead up to an event that may not beIable to operate.T56 s9(2)(f)(iv)CAORP57 Third, I also propose to increase the gathering limit for unvaccinated people(or a mixed group of vaccinated and unvaccinated) at Red, which is currently10. A capacity limit of 10 is not supported by public health advice, raisesproportionality concerns given the importance of social connection (especially131chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCEat Christmas), and is impractical for large families that may want to cometogether for a gathering. I therefore propose to increase the limit forgatherings with no vaccination certificates to 25, based on 1m distancing. Thisis still significantly less than the limit at Orange of 50.D58 Fourth, I am aware that there is some confusion about whether business andservice operators can ‘switch’ between requiring vaccination certificates andEnot. Such situations may arise when a premise is hosting sequential events orsettings of clients (e.g. a restaurant with a first and second dinner seating), orSsequential gatherings (e.g. viewings of tūpāpaku or deceased person).Provided that sequential cohorts are managed so that no intermingling ofAgroups occurs, and rooms are ventilated and high-touch surfaces cleanedbetween cohorts, public health advice supports allowing switching betweenvaccinated and unvaccinated settings – provided this is madeE clear to allinvolved (staff and attendees) and there are clear processes to manage this.LDefinition of public facilityE59 The Framework indicates that public facilities can open at Green with norequirements, at Orange with capacity limits bRased on one metre distancing,and Red with up to 100 people based on one metre distancing. There are noCVC requirements specified for these facilities at any level, but CVCs are notprohibited from being used at such facilities. Given the comparatively moreYpermissive settings for these types of facilities compared to events orgatherings for example, it is important that public facilities are well-definedLwithin the Protection Framework Order.E60 I do not consider that the current way of defining public facilities in the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020 Act, which is by way of example only,Vshould be carried over to the Framework. The intent of having separaterequirements for public facilities is to reflect that they are publicly funded, forIprovision of public-good, recreational or community services (or similar). ITpropose we direct officials to define and set policy settings for public facilitiesto reflect these differentiating characteristics. A working definition is providedCin Appendix Three.Education Asettings61 The COVID-19 Protection Framework settings provide for all educationOservices to remain open for all learners at each level, with appropriate publichealth controls in place. Distance learning will continue to be provided forlearners who are self-isolating. This is different to the current arrangements inRAuckland, where learners in years 0-8 may be attending school part-time from17 November.P62 By the time, we transition to the COVID-19 Protection Framework, there willonly be 2-3 weeks of term left for the academic year. Given the amount ofdisruption and change for learners, parents and schools (particularly those inAuckland and Waikato), I am proposing to allow schools to retain their existingsettings for the last few weeks of term, and transition to the new requirementsfor the beginning of term 1, 2022. I propose to remove the current groupingrequirements for early childhood services and tertiary providers immediately.141chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCEOther minor changes to the Framework63 Some other minor changes are required to the Framework settings. Forexample, we need to replace the use of the term ‘CVCs’ with My VaccinePass. We also need to reconsider our phrasing of encouraging working fromDhome at Red, as some workplaces can operate safely at Red, and for theseworkplaces, encouraging working from home may not be necessary. We mustErecognise that when it can be done safely, having workers within workplacesbenefits local economies and is important for social connection.SCVC early access programme for Auckland hairdressersA64 CVCs are a key part of the new Framework. The Director-General of Health isconsidering a request for an exemption to Auckland hairdressers from theEcurrent Alert Level Order to allow them to participate in an early accessprogramme for CVCs. If granted, this programme will begin on Thursday 25LNovember. It will allow Auckland hairdressers to operate under Alert Level 3Step 2, if they make CVCs a condition of entry.E65 The Office of the Director Public Health has advised the public health risk ofallowing the programme to go ahead is low. AR range of public health riskmitigation measures have been proposed and guidance on these measureswill be provided to hairdressers who choose to participate in the programme.YAllowing more people to enter Auckland66 s9(2)(f)(iv) LEVI .TRisksC67 The risks in shifting the country outside of Auckland into the framework couldbroadly be described under our strategy as:A67.1 Minimisation risks – that the framework or system response does notsufficiently minimise spread and serious harm from COVID-19; andO67.2Protection risks – that the move to the new framework doesn’tR sufficiently protect the most vulnerable.Minimisation risksP68 Our ability to minimise the spread of COVID-19 relies on the public healthmeasures in the framework, the system response to COVID-19, and the widercontext that we are operating in. The overall approach of the Framework isbased on evidence that very high vaccination rates will minimise the spreadand severity of COVID-19 transmission.69 If measures such as the use of CVCs, and the limits imposed on people underthe Orange and Red settings, are insufficient to stop spread lockdown type151chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCEmeasures may need to be used more frequently than we expected. Inparticular, the effectiveness of CVCs could be undermined by fraudulent useor increased private social gatherings of unvaccinated people who can nolonger gather in public hospitality venues.D70 We expect that opening the Auckland boundary for more travellers whiletransmission continues in the city will increase the rate at which cases areEseeded in other regions, despite the mitigating effect of requiring thattravellers are vaccinated or tested. This will be more likely in places thatSexperience higher volumes of travellers from Auckland. Historical movementand electronic transaction data suggest that the places that will experienceAthe greatest proportion of travellers from Auckland are Northland (~20% oftravellers), the Waikato (~20%) and Thames-Coromandel district (~13%) andthe Bay of Plenty and Tauranga (~24%). E71 Maintaining the effectiveness of our contact tracing and testing systems,Lincluding through the use of Rapid Antigen Tests will be critical to minimisingspread. We are also considering changes to the conEtact tracing and testingstrategy today. If the demands due to the spread of COVID-19 exceed ourcapacities, the spread will likely further acceleRrate.72 The Framework will rely on timely and accurate intelligence and data to informdecisions about changes in levels. If the system cannot provide reliableYinformation on likely pressure on health system capacity ahead of time, thenour response will lag behind the increasing caseloads and will not respond inLtime to minimise serious health impacts. The dashboard that the Ministry ofHealth is developing should mitigate this risk, particularly once it is able toEinclude lead indicators that take into account modelling for example.73 The Ministry of Health Vis also establishing a group of internal and independentreviewers to perform an assurance function, with the aim of improving theMinistry of HealthI’s Framework Assessment methodology over time andTsupporting those involved in the process.C74 The context that these decisions are taken in is important. Currently we arefaced with a single large outbreak with several chains that we can link throughcontAact tracing. Further spread, or the introduction of changes at the border,could increase the number of unlinked cases that seed new outbreaks andOclusters. We are reducing this risk by taking a structured approach tochanging our domestic framework, and then making phased changes to ourborder settings.RProtectionrisksP75 The key risks for the protection of people come from spread amongstunvaccinated and vulnerable people, risks to health system readiness, andour ability to provide community care and supports.76 Despite overall high vaccination rates, there will be pockets with communitiesof people with low vaccination rates that interact together. For example, ruralcommunities with low vaccination rates and large Māori and Pacificpopulations.161chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCE77 A key risk of moving to the new Framework is the ability for the framework toprotect these communities. While the Framework is intended to reduce therisk of spread from unvaccinated people in high risk scenarios, strongermeasures may be required to reduce spread where it occurs within thesecommunities. From modelling results and international observation, we expect Dthat transmission in regions and communities with lower rates of vaccinationwill be faster and more challenging to control. The consequences of this Etransmission, in terms of individual impacts and health system utilisation, willalso be greater. S78 Our approach to protecting people is dependent on continuing to improveAvaccination uptake, plus the community care and social support systems thatwill allow whānau to respond to cases in their household. It is important thatthe community care and social supports we approve today areE implementedrapidly where required. Similarly, it is essential that our health system issupported to meet the clinical needs of an increasing numLbers of cases. Wemust recognise that this will require a differentiated approach that accountsfor the different starting points of DHBs and Māori NEGO health sectorproviders. Without targeted additional support some will struggle, potentiallycompounding existing inequitable health outcoRmes.79 Housing capacity is a key concern for supporting self-isolation and protectingvulnerable communities. Where positive cases are unable to self-isolate in aYhome, and a managed isolation and quarantine facility is unavailable, theremay be limited capacity for theseL people to be accommodated. The housingsystem is already under stress in many areas and limited additional capacityis available, including in areEas with low vaccination rates. Similarly, thoserequiring emergency housing may not be able to be accommodated due toVincreasing numbers of people in self-isolation. The reopening of internationalborders may exacerbate these issues.I80 These implemeTntation risks will be heightened with the pace we areintroducing the new system. Moving all New Zealand to the new Frameworkat the samCe time avoids the issues associated with complexity of running twosystems. However, the details of the Framework and support measures arebeinAg developed at pace.Next stepsO81 The Prime Minister and I will bring a paper to Cabinet on 29 November toconfirm when to transition all New Zealand to the Framework. This decisionRwill be informed by a CPF assessment to determine the appropriate Levels fordifferent parts of the country.PFinancial Implications82 The specific financial implications associated with moving to the Frameworkwill be dealt with in related Cabinet papers, which Cabinet will consider overthe coming week.171chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCELegislative Implications83 To give effect to the Framework, I will make Orders under the COVID-19Public Health Response Act 2020, following consultation with specifiedMinisters. The infringement offence penalty framework will be set inDregulations subject to the passage of the COVID-19 Public HealthAmendment Bill 2021, and then given effect to through Orders.EImpact AnalysisS84 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that theproposals in this Cabinet paper relating to transitioning to the new COVID-19AProtection Framework are exempt from the requirement to provide aRegulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that they are intended toEmanage, mitigate, or alleviate the short-term impacts of a declared emergencyevent of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implementation of the policy isLrequired urgently to be effective (making complete, robust and timely impactanalysis unfeasible).

Decisions need to be informed by goodEfaith engagement with, and appropriate knowledge of, the views of iwi leadersand other representatives of potentially vulnerable Māori communities. TreatySprinciples require the Crown to do what is reasonable in the circumstances. Inthe context of the Framework, this involves considering what will support anational response that is co-ordinated, orderly and proportionate, inA light ofthe Crown’s obligation to actively protect Māori interests. The Crown shouldalso look for opportunities to enable for-Māori by-Māori responEses.90 The virus has had a disproportionate health impact on Māori and PacificLcommunities. As well as making up a large proportion of cases to date, Māoriand Pacific peoples generally have higher rates of co-morbidities that result inEpoorer outcomes if they are infected with the virus. Younger Māori have someof the lowest vaccination rates and are therefore at higher risk of healthRimpacts and being excluded due to CVC requirements.91 Current vaccination rates are lower for M āori compared to the average acrossNew Zealand. Lower vaccination ratesY coupled with a disproportionate burdenof disease mean Māori communities are at a greater risk of illness and deathas we transition between framewLorks.92 Moves that have been takenE to control the outbreak strongly and quickly havebeen intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19 to all New Zealanders,including vulnerable poVpulations. Transitioning to the Framework does notchange our focus on increasing vaccination coverage. Additional funding isbeing provided to Māori health providers, and DHBs are continuing their pushIto increase vacTcination rates.93 It is important that this funding is held by Māori organisations to designCsolutions for and with Māori communities, in partnership with local DHBs andorganisations. It should be recognised that while incentives may increaseAvaccination rates among some individuals, a process of building trust througheffective engagement with (particularly vulnerable) Māori communities shouldOalso lie at the heart of any ongoing strategy to boost vaccination rates. This isbecause people who do not trust the source of information (e.g. the need toget vaccinated) are unlikely to follow the advice from it.R94Transitioning all New Zealand to the Framework in early December, ratherP than relying on the achievement of 90% vaccination rates per DHB, will putvulnerable Maori communities at greater risk of COVID-19 infection soonerthan expected. Even with vaccination and testing requirements in place tocross the Auckland Alert Level boundary, there is an increased likelihood ofthe virus spreading throughout the country.95 The related papers Cabinet will consider today and over the coming week(referenced in paragraphs 14, 16 and 81) will help to ensure people canaccess the support they need when we transition to the Framework. Funding191chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCEbeing sought for local service providers by MSD and the Māori CommunitiesCOVID-19 Fund can also provide some of this support. Phase 2 of the MāoriCommunities COVID-19 Fund will focus on building resilience in Māoriwhānau and communities to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 outbreaks. Iexpect relevant officials will continue to work together with Māori partners in Dimplementing both the Fund and the Framework to mitigate anydisproportionate impacts on Māori. E96 With increased COVID-19 management in the community, Māori will need toSinput into local and national decision-making. Engagement with the Iwi ChairsForum Pandemic Response Group is an example of work at a national level.AThe Framework also allows for increased local input, including input by Iwi,hapū and Māori organisations into decision-making (paragraph 33 refers).E97 We have preserved the ability to use localised lockdowns where necessary,and this will be an important option to protect vulnerable Lcommunities in theworst scenarios. Māori healthcare providers will be engaged in discussions onhow to incorporate lead indicators into assessment Edata for consideringregional level changes under the Framework (paragraph 33 refers). Imposingtougher restrictions to better manage health ouRtcomes could result in worseeconomic outcomes for Māori in the short term.Population and economic impacts Y98 On 18 October and 15 November, Cabinet considered the impacts of theLchange in strategy from the Alert Level system to the Framework [CAB-21-MIN-0421 refers]. These included the health impacts from further spread ofECOVID-19 in the community and population impacts from measures used tosuppress cases.V99 This paper focuses on the economic impacts of the Framework and does notreiterate the popuIlation impacts previously provided. More detailedinformation aboTut how transitioning to the Framework impacts populations,particularly in the context of different entry levels, will be provided whenCabinet taCkes decisions on these levels next week.100 Under the Framework, most businesses will be able to operate normally in theAcontext of COVID-19, particularly under the Green level. Under the Orangeand Red levels, the main exception would be businesses that do notOimplementCVC requirements, which we want to discourage.R101 The following table shows the difference between the anticipated economicimpact of the Framework and the estimated economic impact under the AlertLevel system. These initial estimates suggest that the economic impact of thePFramework is likely to be much lower when compared with Alert Level 3 and 4restrictions. The economic impacts under the Framework will also likely be atthe lower ends of the ranges estimated as the international border reopensfurther.201chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:55:25IN-CONFIDENCETable 2: Estimated economic impact under public health frameworks(Figures note the impact for all New Zealand and are relative to forecastactivity with no public health restrictions.

Under the Framework, many ofTthose sectors operating with CVCs under the Red level will be able to do sowith reduced restrictions compared to those under Alert Level 2. Any impactCon economic activity could therefore be more evenly spread across allsectors.AConsultationO103 This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group in the Department of thePrime Minister and Cabinet.

As we make this transition it is important toIreduce and maTnage risk. As mitigations, we have been clear in ourcommunication with the public that the Auckland region will transition to theFrameworCk at Red, and that no region would be at Green. This position issupported by the Health Assessment undertaken for our decisions today bythe AMinistry of Health; the assessment recommends Auckland and Northlandtransition to Red, and the rest of New Zealand to Orange.1O5 We propose, as a transitional measure, that Cabinet considers shifting otherareas to Red that are popular holiday places for visitors and/or with relativelyR lower vaccination rates: Taupō and Rotorua Lakes; Gisborne; Ōpōtiki,Kawerau and Whakatane; and Rangitikei, Whanganui and Ruapehu Districts.P6 Outside of Northland, these districts have some of the lowest vaccinationrates relative to other parts of the country, and lower rates of vaccination forMāori despite a significant increase in Māori vaccination throughout1 The Ministry of Health’s assessment is undertaken according to DHB. DPMC has translated these tolocal government regions or districts as per Cabinet’s agreement on 22 November [CAB-MIN-0477refers]11chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVENovember. It is important in making this decision we balance a range ofconsiderations. We need to be satisfied that we are imposing no morerestrictions on people than reasonably necessary (i.e. the least infringementon rights in the current environment) and measures are proportionate toachieve a precautionary transition into the new Framework. While vaccination Drates are lower in these areas, the Ministry of Health has taken into accountvaccination rates, along with health system capacity, in its advice on the EFramework settings. s9(2)(h)S7 Cabinet will review the Framework settings we decide today on 13 December,Aand Ministers with Power to Act will review the settings again on 17 January2022. Therefore, emergency notwithstanding, it is important that we decide onEsettings that we think will endure through the summer break.LIntroductionE8 On 15 November Cabinet agreed that anyone would be able to cross thecurrent Auckland Alert Level boundary, provided they are fully vaccinated orRhave had a negative test in the previous 72 hours from 15 December until16 January 2022 [CAB-MIN-0477 refers]. On 22 November Cabinet agreedthat all New Zealand would transition to the COVID-19 Protection FrameworkYat 11.59pm Thursday 2 December [CAB-MIN-0497 refers].LDecision-making factorsE9 In October Cabinet agreed to take into account the following factors whenmaking decisions about moving between different levels of the Framework:V9.1 Health factors: vaccination rates, health system capacity, testing andIcontact tracing capacity, and transmission, particularly in vulnerableTpopulations; andC9.2 Non-health factors: effects of the proposed measures on economy andsociety, impacts on at risk populations, public attitudes, and operationalAconsiderations [CAB-21-MIN-0421 refers].10 OIn providing advice on non-health factors, when relevant, officials will alsoconsider the impact of other non-COVID-19 emergencies and naturaldisasters.RUpdateon the current outbreak and responseP11 As at 9am Friday 26 November 2021, there were 79 people in hospital due toCOVID-19, including 8 in intensive care or high dependency units (ICU/HDU).The average age of people in hospital is 51 years. There are 5,339 activecommunity cases associated with the current COVID-19 outbreak. The seven-day rolling average of cases is 187. There have been 16 deaths in thisoutbreak. We are beginning to see more deaths as more people are infected.21chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVE12 The growth of cases in Auckland has slowed in recent weeks, which has alsoslowed the growth in the hospitalisation and ICU/HDU conversion rate. Basedon observed cases, averaging across several methods, R in the currenteffoutbreak is 1.04 up to Monday 22 November. If there are undetectedinfections the true R will be higher. Deff13 Based on the recent slowing in case numbers, and the effect of increasingEvaccinations, the latest projections from Te Pūnaha Matatini (TPM) indicatethat growth in case numbers in Auckland will continue to slow over theSremainder of the year, and new case numbers may decrease. Under a morepessimistic scenario, there is a risk that relaxed restrictions for vaccinatedApeople under the Framework may cause case numbers to rise over thecoming weeks.E14 The observed trajectory of cases during Alert level 3 followed a path inbetween the upper and middle scenarios in the modellingL done around mid-October (discussed in 18 October Review of Alert Level Settings [CAB-MIN-E0422 refers]). This scenario projected 600 to 670 cases per week in Octoberand 1,000 to 1,600 cases per week in November. We have observed, onRaverage, 600 per week in October and 1,200 per week in November.15 Given the Framework is untested, the an alysis is highly sensitive to theassumptions that underpin it. AnalysisY of the transmission potential under theFramework indicates that if the settings are less effective than assumed,modelled outcomes worsen signLificantly. Actual outcomes will need to bemonitored closely.ESpread of cases outside Auckland is difficult to predictV16 As we enter the summer period of increased travel and the Aucklandboundary is relaxIed, there is further risk that cases will spread outside ofAuckland. AnaTlysis of travel patterns using road and air travel data indicatesthat more than 100,000 Aucklanders leave the city each day over the summerperiod. CoCupling this with historic electronic card transaction data, Northland,Waikato (particularly Thames-Coromandel) and Bay of Plenty (particularlyTauAranga) have the greatest influx from Auckland by road. For air travellers,Christchurch and Wellington are the two largest destinations, followed byQueenstown, Nelson and Napier. While this does not provide a directOindicationof case spread, it indicates the increase in risk related to therelaxation of the border around Auckland.R17TPM’s modelling also indicates that cases seeded outside of Auckland mayP see outbreaks that grow in size, depending on factors such as vaccinationlevels and types of gathering. Not all cases will go on to infect others; so newcases do not automatically lead to widespread transmission. The higher thevaccination coverage is in an area, the less likely it is that each new case willlead to established transmission. However, regions that receive many visitorsfrom Auckland may be more likely to also experience a higher number of newcases, which may make wider transmission a case of when, not if.31chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVE18 The dynamics around low-level transmission mean that modelling cannotpredict when case numbers will arise in different areas or when transmissionbecomes established, rather than sporadic, in different local areas. Themodelling can, however, give a sense of how the transmission dynamics willvary in different places, if transmission does become established. TPM is Dcurrently undertaking work to model this.E19 More highly vaccinated communities are more likely to experience slowertransmission, meaning that test, trace, isolate and quarantine measures canSbe used more effectively to mitigate spread and impact, and impacts are likelyto be less severe in terms of hospitalisations and deaths. Cases in higherAvaccinated communities are likely to accrue disproportionately in theunvaccinated, including children under 12 who are ineligible. Children underE12 generally have mild or asymptomatic infection but may transmit infection tomore vulnerable whānau members.LEntry point for each region into the COVID-19 Protection FrameworkEWe will use a cautious approach entering the FramewRork20 We have been clear in our communication that we will take a cautiousapproach to our transition to the Framework, in order to ensure it will work toYminimise spread. Additionally, over the summer period there are more peopletravelling around the country, particularly people from Auckland, with moreLgatherings and large events. We therefore propose that initially, during atransition phase, no regions enter at Green.E21 This is consistent with our previous cautious approach to risk managementVunder Alert Levels, noting that while Auckland remained at Alert Level 3, therest of New Zealand would not move to Alert Level 1 to mitigate the risk andIimpact of the virus seeding in other areas.T22 We propose Auckland transitions to the Red setting of the Framework. WithCcases plateauing and vaccination rates continuing to climb, we are ready tomove into the Framework, but a step down to Orange before we have had theoppAortunity to embed the Framework would risk a significant change in spreaddynamics.O23 There are some further considerations we could make for the initial step forother regions. The Ministry of Health’s Health Assessment identified thatRNorthland should move with Auckland into Red, because of its dependency onAuckland health care services, lower Māori vaccination rates and becauseP they have had a disproportionate number of cases being seeded fromAuckland during this outbreak compared to the Waikato. The HealthAssessment recommends that all other regions should transition to Orange.24 These areas are likely to see significant numbers of visitors from Aucklandover the summer period, particularly if they are in Orange and can hold largeevents. Red would mean that large events and gatherings would be restricted41chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVEfor both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, reducing the opportunity forhigh risk exposure events.25 The West Coast also has low vaccination rates but is a less popular holidaydestination for Aucklanders. The Waikato, while having high numbers of Dvisitors from Auckland, has high vaccination rates overall and higher rates forMāori than the other areas listed above.E26 We recommend Cabinet considers whether under a precautionary approach,STaupō and Rotorua Lakes2; Gisborne3; Ōpōtiki, Kawerau and Whakatane4;and Rangitikei, Whanganui and Ruapehu Districts5 should also transition toAthe Red setting of the Framework due to their lower vaccination rates andlower Māori vaccination rates.E27 A map of New Zealand showing territorial local authorities (city and districtcouncils) is attached as Appendix 1. LEMinistry of Health COVID-19 Protection Framework health assessment28 On Wednesday 24 November, the Ministry of RHealth conducted the firstCOVID-19 Protection Framework Assessment (Health Assessment) toconsider which framework setting each r egion should transition to initially.Y29 The initial assessment involved the Ministry of Health looking at the expectedimpacts of COVID-19 in all regions on the healthcare system, and theLcapacity and capability of the system to meet the demand while continuing todeliver other essential healtEh services (e.g. primary care, cancer care, electivesurgery, etc).V30 In considering the ‘demand’ for healthcare in light of the evolving the COVID-19 situation, the Ministry of Health took into account a wide range of factorsIincluding:T30.1 vaccination rates by ethnicity;C30.2 testing rates by ethnicity;A30.3 ESR wastewater sampling;O30.4active cases;R30.5 high risk exposure events over the next 14 days;P 30.6 compliance with current restrictions; and2 Lakes DHB area3 Hauora Tairāwhiti area4 Eastern Bay of Plenty – which is part of the Bay of Plenty DHB area (excluding Tauranga City and Western Bay of PlentyDistrict)5 Whanganui DHB area51chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVE30.7 any other factors that might impact on demand for healthcare in a givenregion or regions (e.g. flood, earthquake or other infectious disease).31 In looking at the capacity and capability of the health system to manageCOVID-19 alongside other demands over the next 14 days, the Ministry’s Dassessment considered data across three main areas:E31.1 Healthcare services – the Ministry's assessment explored whetherthere would be sufficient services available to the public to meetSdemand in each region and across the regions. This included, forexample exploring whether each DHB had in place appropriate modelsAof care for those with COVID-19 in the community, such as mentalhealth support services, as well as enough skilled workers (e.g. ICU-Eskilled staff).L31.2 Equity – the Ministry’s assessment included consideration of how wellplaced each DHB and/or region is to meet the needs of those most atErisk from COVID-19. This included, for example, considering whethereach region had in place sufficiently robust engagement arrangementsRwith Māori and Pacific providers to ensure they have enough capacityto deliver end to end support services for those most at risk.31.3 Support services – the MinistryY’s assessment explored whether therewould likely be enough supplies of critical support services to meetdemand for COVID-19 anLd non-COVID related healthcare services.This included, for example, considering whether there would beenough laboratory caEpacity and testing supplies to meet demand andsufficient managed isolation places for those unable to self-isolate inthe community.V32 The assessment Iinvolved careful consideration of the above range of factorsby a committeeT including the most senior members of the Ministry of Health,including the Chief Medical Officer, Chief Nurse and Director of Public Health.Advice onC the proposed settings for each DHB area was subsequentlyprovided to the Director-General of Health, who agreed to it.A33 s9(2)(f)(iv)ORP34 Appendix 2 includes more information about the factors in the HealthAssessment, and the questions for determining each level of the Framework.The Ministry’s initial assessment based on these factors resulted in Aucklandbeing at Red, the South Island and the Wellington Region at Green, andOrange elsewhere. However, given concerns about the number of areas withlower vaccination rates – particularly for Māori – current active cases inseveral DHBs (not just in the Auckland region) and weighing up health system61chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVEcapacity and capability considerations in each region, it was recommendedthat all regions should enter the Framework at Orange, except for Northlandand Auckland metro DHBs, which should be at Red. It also recommended thatno region should be at Green while Auckland was in Red. The Director-General confirmed these recommendations. D35 The Ministry of Health will undertake Health Assessments to reviewEFramework settings across the country every two weeks. Over time, once thetransition to the new Framework is complete and the situation is stable, theSaim would be to shift to monthly assessments, unless needed earlier basedon a data-evidenced need.A36 Regional Leadership Groups across New Zealand are the mechanism byEwhich information on regional non-health factors will feed into Frameworkdecision-making. The 16 groups will also oversee and enable effective locally-led care in the community, in line with Cabinet’s agreemeLnt on the ManagingCOVID-19 Care in the Community and welfare system approach. FurtherEdetail on this decision-making process will be provided for Cabinet on13 December.RConsidering additional regions for the Red setting of the Framework37 There is a choice for Ministers as to wYhether to apply a more precautionarysetting for some areas as a transitional, time-limited measure during thesummer period, and while vaccinLation rates further increase. This would coverthe time when we are first starting to use the Framework and there is extramovement around the counEtry, particularly out of Auckland. In particular, therecould be benefit in taking a view across the summer period as a whole, ratherthan the view of high-rVisk exposure events in the next 14 days that informedthe Health Assessment.I38 We propose thTat Cabinet discuss whether the following areas should enter atOrange or Red:C38.1 Taupō and Rotorua Lakes Districts (Lakes DHB area); and/orA38.2 Gisborne District (Hauora Tairāwhiti DHB area); and/orO38.3Ōpōtiki, Kawerau and Whakatane Districts (in the eastern part of theBay of Plenty DHB area); and/orR38.4 Whanganui, Rangitikei and Ruapehu Districts (Whanganui DHB area).P39 Whether to move these areas to Red requires careful consideration of a rangeof factors. These include:39.1 vaccination rates;39.2 local views, including iwi concerns and the Treaty principle of activeprotection;71chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVE39.3 the application of the Framework; and39.4 proportionality.Vaccination rates D40 Aside from Northland, Hauora Tairāwhiti, Whanganui and Lakes DHB areasEhave the lowest vaccination rates. Although overall Bay of Plenty does nothave lower than average vaccination rates, there are significant disparitiesSwith the area with much lower rates generally and for Māori in the eastern Bayof Plenty. Kawerau, Ōpōtiki, and Whakatane Districts have the lowestAvaccination rates in New Zealand by territorial local authority.Table 1: Vaccination rates in key areas E2nd dose all Māori 2nd Māori Projected 2ndLethnicities dose aged 60+ dose by 132nd dose Dec allEethnicities (asat 21RNovember)Tairāwhiti, DHB 74% 63% 91% 73-79%Lakes DHB 77% Y61% 91% 77-81%Bay of Plenty 79% 59% 90% 79-84%LDHB6Ōpotiki District 69% 60%EWhakatane 70% 54%District VKawerau 64% 54%IDistrictTTauranga City 82% 60%CWestern Bay of 80% 59%Plenty DistrictAWhanganui 77% 60% 90% 78-81%DHB7OWhanganui 76% 59%DistrictRRangitikei 78% 66%DistrictPRuapehu 70% 55%District6 Bay of Plenty DHB area include the following territorial local authorities: Tauranga City Council,Western Bay of Plenty District Council, Kawerau District Council, Ōpotiki District Council andWhakatane District Council.7 Whanganui DHB area includes the following territorial local authorities: Whanganui District,Rangitikei District and Ruapehu District (part of which is in Waikato DHB area).81chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVE41 The Lakes DHB area, the eastern part of the Bay of Plenty DHB area, and theHauora Tairāwhiti DHB area will all have visitors from Auckland over thesummer period, particularly if major events go ahead. Historical electronic Dtransaction data show that of Auckland travellers, 22% travel to Waikato (ofwhich ~4% are in Taupō), 16% travel to Bay of Plenty (half of which are inETauranga), and 5% travel to Gisborne and Hawkes Bay. The number oftravellers to these regions from Auckland will increase the likelihood of newScases being seeded, although the slowing of growth in cases in Auckland willreduce this risk.A42 While vaccination rates are lower in these areas, as noted in paragraph 30Eabove, the Ministry of Health has already taken into account vaccination ratesin its advice on the Framework settings. It considers that decisions should bebased on an assessment that also considers factors sucLh as health systemcapacity and capability to manage demand.E43 On 3 December it is expected that these regions will be below our originalmilestone of 90%, and the rates for Māori will bRe even lower. Vaccinationprojections for each DHB area are provided in Appendix 3. Shifting theseregions to the Red level of the Framewo rk would provide greater protectionand is sought by many iwi leaders. HoYwever, it should also be considered thatMāori in older age groups who are at higher risk of serious illness have highervaccination rates. LIwi concerns and the principle of aEctive protection44 In some of these regions local iwi have voiced significant concerns over theVlevel of protection afforded to Māori, especially where there are lowervaccination rates. Te Arawhiti has had conversations with iwi leaders andIreport that iwi iTn the Lakes DHB area, eastern Bay of Plenty and Tairāwhitiare concerned about health system capacity in their rohe, the relatively lowvaccinatioCn rates amongst Māori and socio-economic deprivation in theircommunities. We are advised that these iwi would prefer their rohe enter theFramework at Red. There is particular concern about hui being held at maraeAand the risk unvaccinated people pose to others. The lower gathering limits atRed would mitigate this risk to some extent.O45 s9(2)(h)RP91chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVEs9(2)(h)s9(2)(g)(i) DESAELProportionality and other considerationsE47 Increasing the Framework settings in these regions, particularly where thereare no current cases, would impact both vacciRnated and unvaccinated people.We need to be sure that this is proportionate to the risk from lower vaccinationrates s9(2)(h)These areas are all at Alert LYevel 2 currently. Settings under Orangewill be more relaxed for vaccinated people but stricter for unvaccinated. AtOrange, indoor events cannot beL held if My Vaccine Pass is not used, andaccess to hospitality venues is restricted to contactless only. Gatherings arelimited to up to 50 if My VacEcine pass is not used. We expect that thesestricter settings will encourage more people to get vaccinated.V48 The Red setting is close to the current Alert Level 2 settings for vaccinatedpeople, but closer to Alert Level 3 for unvaccinated people. One of the mostIsignificant diffeTrences for vaccinated people will be the limitation of largeevents to less than 100, e.g. the Rotorua Summer Festival, Le Currents inTaupō, anCd Rhythm and Vines in Gisborne.49 s9(2)(g)(i)AOR50 We also need to be mindful of the complexity of placing regions at Red whenPsurrounding areas are at Orange and there is a lot of travel between them.People are more likely to comply with rules when they are clear which regionthey are in and therefore which settings apply. The central location of theLakes DHB area means that there will many people crossing between it andother regions, including the eastern Bay of Plenty. If Taupō and RotoruaLakes Districts were in Red, and to a lesser extent, the eastern Bay, it could101chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVEcreate complexity with large numbers of people crossing frequently betweenregions with different settings.ProposalD51 The Ministry of Health’s COVID-19 Protection Framework health assessmentand advice from the Director-General of Health recommends that Auckland Eand Northland transition to the Framework at Red and the rest of the countryat Orange. S52 Ministers may also wish to consider, in light of the lower vaccinationA rates,especially amongst Māori, whether any or all of the following should alsoinitially be at Red to provide additional protection to those communities whileEvaccination rates lift:L52.1 Taupō and Rotorua Lakes Districts (Lakes DHB area);E52.2 Gisborne District (Hauora Tairāwhiti area);52.3 Ōpōtiki, Kawerau and Whakatane DistrRicts (the eastern part of the Bayof Plenty DHB area); and52.4 Rangitikei, Whanganui and RuaYpehu Districts (Whanganui DHB8).53 We will review these settings at our pre-Christmas check-in on MondayL13 December.E54 Ministers may also wish to consider whether the South Island could shift toGreen earlier based on the requirements that airlines and ferry companies areVplacing on customers, when we review these settings at our pre-Christmascheck-in on Monday 13 December.ITAssessment of the proposals against the non-health factorsC55 The following section assesses the proposed settings against the non-healthfactors agreed by Cabinet. There are positive social and economic impacts forAmoving from Alert Level 3 to Red for Auckland, and from Alert Level 2 toOrange for the rest of New Zealand. There are fewer restrictions for peopleOandbusinesses unless they are unvaccinated, except for areas moving fromAlert Level 2 to Red. Operationally, we are well placed for the transition, withR My Vaccine Passes and guidance on the new Framework having alreadybeen released or scheduled for release today.P8 Ruapehu District is covered by both Whanganui and Waikato DHBs but there is a case for all of it tobe at Red given that of Territorial Local Authorities, it has the 3rd lowest Māori vaccination rate.111chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVEImpacts on at risk populations and iwi56 Impacts on populations of moving to the Framework will be felt differentlyacross regions in New Zealand depending on the changes being made, but ingeneral there will be four main impacts:D56.1 increases in freedoms for most people in Auckland when they transitionEto Red;56.2 fewer restrictions for most people and businesses in most regions Stransitioning from Alert Level 2 to Orange;A56.3 increased restrictions for some people and businesses in Alert Level 2areas that will transition to Red;E56.4 increases in restrictions across the board for unvaccinated people.L57 Some iwi in vulnerable regions have expressed clear expectations of strongerEmeasures to protect their communities. This includes vaccination and testingrequirements for people coming into their regions, and expectations we willRnot move to the Framework until we reach higher vaccination rates. TheNational Iwi Chairs Pandemic Response Group recently wrote to Ministersasking that the original 90% targets for each DHB be maintained (noting theyYhad originally asked for 95%).58 It is possible that in some placesL iwi will seek to put checkpoints in place, asthey have during earlier responses. Previously, Police have provided supportEand oversight to such checkpoints as their purpose was consistent with rulesrestricting movement at the time. However, this will not be the case under theVFramework where there are no restrictions on movement, or requirements forpeople entering any of these regions. Ministers and Te Arawhiti are workingwith iwi leaders toI work through what could be done to address this issue. TheTproblem could to some extent be alleviated by moving some of these regionsto Red, if that were agreed by Cabinet today. This will mean there are fewerCpeople travelling into these regions, and iwi may feel they are being placed atlower risk from visitors because their rohe has the additional protections frombeinAg at Red.59 OThe move to requiring widespread use of My Vaccine Pass is creatingchallenges for some at-risk populations. Across all DHBs, the rates ofvaccination are higher for those with a disability than those without. OlderRNew Zealanders also have higher vaccination rates across all ethnicities.However, the application process for the My Vaccine Pass continues to be aP ‘hot topic’ for the disability community, some of whom do not have forms ofidentification that mean they can access the pass through standard onlinemeans. There is concern from the Office for Seniors that a significant minorityof older people will not know what a vaccine passport is until they go out andtry to access a service. There may also be access issues for those in regionswith limited digital access.121chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVE60 Moving to the Framework will alleviate some of the pressures experienced byyouth, disabled and older people to date due to lockdowns, such as isolation.However, this will be tempered by perceived risks regarding safety. Disabledpeople and older people will be seeking reassurance that My Vaccine Passrequirements are being consistently applied to enjoy the relative freedoms of Dthe Framework.EEconomic impacts from the FrameworkS61 Under the Framework, most businesses will be able to operate relativelynormally in the context of COVID-19, particularly under Green. Under OrangeAand Red, the main exception to normal operations will be businesses that donot implement My Vaccine Pass requirements, which we want to discourage.E62 The table below shows the difference between the anticipated economicLimpact of the Framework and the estimated economic impact under the AlertLevel system. These figures estimate the impact for all New Zealand and areErelative to forecast activity with no restrictions. Framework figures do notincorporate the potential impact from any local or regional lockdowns. InRfuture, as regional differences emerge and information (data) improves, theTreasury will be able to provide estimated impacts for scenarios whereregional settings differ in Framework dec ision-making Cabinet papers.YTable 1: Estimated economic impact under public health frameworksLAlert Level systemEAlert Level 2 -4 to -6% of GDPVAlert Level 3 -10 to -15% of GDPIAlert Level 4 -25 to -30% of GDPTCOVID-19 Protection FrameworkCGreen -0 to -4% of GDPAOrange -1 to -5% of GDPRed -2 to -5% of GDPOR63 These initial estimates suggest that the economic impact of the Framework islikely to be much lower when compared with Alert Levels 3 and 4 restrictions.P The economic impacts under the Framework will also likely be at the lowerends of the ranges estimated as the international border opens further.64 While the estimated GDP impact figures between Alert Level 2 and the Redsetting under the Framework are similar in aggregate, time is needed tounderstand the actual sectoral outcomes. At Alert Level 2 the economicimpact of restrictions affected some industries more than others (e.g. theevents sector, hospitality and tourism). Under the Framework, many of those131chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVEsectors operating with My Vaccine Passes at Orange and Red will be able todo so with reduced restrictions compared to those under Alert Level 2; anyimpact on economic activity could therefore be more evenly spread across allsectors.DOperational readinessE65 Implementation planning for the transition to the Framework is underwayacross government with a focus on compliance and Care in the Community.S66 There are no identified obstacles to the transition to the Framework.AGovernance arrangements are in place for the efficient escalation andresolution of issues should they occur through the National Response Group,Ethe National Response Leadership Team and the COVID-19 Chairs Board.67 The key risk area from an operational readiness perspecLtive is the supportstructures for people who cannot isolate at home. It will not be possible inEsome regions to secure enough housing to meet the demand from peoplewho will need to self-isolate. In Northland, for example, many motels havepulled out from offering services as they anticiRpate greater demand fromholiday makers over summer. Officials are working both regionally andnationally to ensure that, within the limite d supply options available, agenciesand partners are well coordinated to sYupport the health and welfare responseand there are dedicated regional housing groups have been formed. TheMinister of Housing and the MinisLter of Social Development and Employmentwill report back to Cabinet in December on the implementation of the welfareand housing approaches unEder the Framework [CAB-21-MIN-493 refers].68 Police advises that theV Framework settings will have significant operationalimpacts for multiple Districts, should several regions shift to Red. This wouldlead to increasedI COVID-19 demand, alongside existing demand, in areaswhere limited PTolice resource can be redeployed. Police has successfullymanaged the prioritisation of COVID-19 and other demand under the AlertLevel framCework, through applying a targeted, risk-based approach to COVID-19 enforcement. This approach would be continued under the new framework,scalAed to the resource capacity of the relevant Police District.69 It is important that people can contact health and welfare support servicesOwhileisolating. Recent announcements by the Minister of Social Developmentand Employment included $204.1m in support for individuals and whānau whoR need to isolate at home and a dedicated 0800 COVID-19 welfare supporthelpline to support those in isolation throughout their recovery. Officials adviseP that a model has been rapidly developed and is ready for implementation from3 December which will be closely monitored.70 Guidance on the new Framework has been developed across 14 sectorsfollowing extensive engagement within each of the sectors. Guidance for allsectors will be live on agency websites or detailed documents shared withstakeholders on or before Monday 29 November.141chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVE71 My Vaccine Passes are a key tool for the new Framework. The legislativeframework is now in place, and Orders made under the new legislation will begazetted on Saturday 27 November. As at 25 November, over 2 millionpasses have been downloaded and NZ Pass Verifier, the free app forscanning and verifying passes, has been downloaded over 100,000 times. D72 Regional Leadership Groups will oversee and enable effective locally-led careEin the community, in line with Cabinet’s agreement on the Managing COVID-19 Care in the Community and welfare system approach. Ministry of SocialSDevelopment Regional Commissioners will take a lead role in coordinating theimplementation of the welfare system approach in their regions. Cabinet hasAagreed to some funding for regional leadership to enable partnerships withiwi, hapū, and other Māori organisations to ensure consistency with Te Tiriti oEWaitangi.LChanges to Framework settingsE73 Ministers with Power to Act delegated by Cabinet on 22 November,considered the proposed Framework settings ahead of public release of theRsummary of settings (Appendix 4) and publication of the first tranche of sectorguidance material. As part of this process, Ministers altered the capacity limitfor public facilities at Red, removing the hard capacity limit of 100, so that theYcapacity limit is now based on one metre distancing only (equivalent to thesettings for public facilities at Orange). s9(2)(f)(iv)LEV74 On 22 November we also directed officials from the Department of the PrimeMinister and Cabinet to review in January 2022 the Framework’s specifiedImaximum capacity limits and investigate the potential to differentiate capacityTlimits between indoors and outdoors. In addition we had earlier agreed thatthe use of My Vaccine Passes be reviewed in the new year [CAB-21-MIN-C0438 refers]. s9(2)(f)(iv)A75 Os9(2)(f)(iv)RP.76 It is not intended for the Framework to impede social services from beingdelivered on the basis of vaccination status. We therefore propose specifiedsocial services (defined as, or similar to ‘a service provided under the OrangaTamariki Act 1989, and other social services provided to support persons tomaintain critical well-being and as crisis support for people who are unsafe or151chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVEhomeless’) be explicitly excluded from the definition of close-proximitybusinesses and services. For the avoidance of doubt, we will also clarify thatsuch social services are exempt from seated and separated food and drinkrules, as there has been some confusion about how these rules apply or notto social services. DFinancial implications E77 The wider financial implications of the move to the Framework have beenSconsidered through other papers or will be considered shortly includingfinancial support for individuals and businesses, and funding for MIQA.Legislative Implications E78 To give effect to the Framework, the Minister for COVID-L19 Response willmake an Order under the COVID-19 Public Health Response Act 2020,following consultation with specified Ministers. E79 A draft version of the COVID-19 Public Health Response (ProtectionRFramework) Order 2021 (the Order) is attached as Appendix 5.9 The Ordercontains a ‘menu’ of all of the restrictions from the Alert Level system as wellnew restrictions like My Vaccine Pass for the new framework. The restrictionsYthat apply at Red, Orange and Green or during a localised lockdown are aselection of restrictions from the menu. The schedules to the Order applyLthese clauses as appropriate, sometimes with small modifications (e.g. tospecify a setting-specific number limit) if needed.E80 There is a separate schedule for each colour setting of the Framework. TheVschedule will specify whether it is active and which parts of New Zealand itapplies to. There are also schedules for when localised lockdowns apply toIoutline how businesses and services can operate and travel related conditionsTfor when restrictions apply to movement between regions.C81 Offences have been specified as infringement offences where appropriatethroughout the Order.

Decisions must be informed by goodfaith engagement with, and appropriate knowledge of, the views of iwi and Dother representatives of potentially vulnerable Māori communities. Treatyprinciples require the Crown to do what is reasonable in the circumstances.E90 In the context of the Framework, this involves considering what will support aSnational response that is co-ordinated, orderly, and proportionate, consideringthe Crown’s obligation to actively protect Māori interests. The Crown shouldAalso look for opportunities to enable for-Māori by-Māori responses.91 Current vaccination rates are lower for Māori compared to theE average acrossNew Zealand. Lower vaccination rates coupled with a disproportionate burdenof disease mean Māori communities are at a greater riskL of illness and deathas we transition into the Framework.E92 For areas with lower Māori vaccination rates, transitioning to Orange ratherthan Red could put vulnerable Māori communiRties at greater risk of COVID-19infection. Even with vaccination or testing requirements in place to cross theAuckland Alert Level boundary, there is an increased likelihood of the virusspreading throughout the country onceY the boundary opens. However, overall,the Framework provides better protection than being at Alert Level 2.L93 While incentives under the Framework may increase vaccination rates amongsome individuals, a processE of building trust through effective engagementwith (particularly vulnerable) Māori communities should also lie at the heart ofany ongoing strategy to boost vaccination rates. This is because people whoVdo not trust the source of information (e.g. the need to get vaccinated) areunlikely to follow the advice from it.IT94 Additional funding is being provided to Māori health providers, and DHBs arecontinuingC their push to increase vaccination rates. It is important that thisfunding is held by Māori organisations to design solutions for and with Māoricommunities, in partnership with local DHBs, Māori health providers and otherAorganisations.OPopulation and economic impactsR95 The population and economic impacts were outlined in earlier sections of thispaper.PNext steps96 Cabinet will review the Framework settings again on 13 December, andMinisters with Power to Act will review the settings again on 17 January 2022.181chtypxg3n 2021-11-30 16:57:47SENSITIVEConsultation97 This paper was prepared by the COVID-19 Group within the Department ofthe Prime Minister and Cabinet.

Ofthe seven ordters, the Committee made one recommendation:c4.1 That the Government amend any current COVID-19 order, and draftaany future COVID-19 order, that grants powers to the Director-Generalof Health to make class exemptions so that those exemptions aredescribed as disallowable instruments that must be presented to theoHouse, and that the Government require those class exemptions toinclude the reasons for them being made.rPCommenton the Regulations Review Committee findings andrecommendations5 The recommendation set out above comprises three issues.Disallowable instruments stated as class exemptions6 On the first issue relating to disallowable instruments, even though theCOVID-19 orders do not include an express statement that the classexemptions are disallowable instruments, s9(2)(h)Nonetheless, this will be resolved when the Legislation Act19xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 13:44:26(Sub-delegated Secondary Legislation) Regulations 2021 comes into force on28 October 2021 because the Regulations will declare the exemptions to besecondary legislation, with the effect of making the exemptions disallowableinstruments.7 All of the COVID-19 orders will be amended by the Legislation Act (Sub- ddelegated Secondary Legislation) Regulations 2021 to declare theexemptions to be secondary legislation. s9(2)(h) es8 The Government considers this to be a significant improvement as it makesathe position clear as to whether or not the exemptions are disallowable(without reference to the “significant legislative effect” test).

We also recommend that the Government require class exemptions toinclude the reasons for them being made.4 Response: The Government thanks the Committee for its recommendationyand addresses each of the issues raised in turn.l5 The first issue raised relates to the status of class exemptions made undereCOVID-19 orders as disallowable instruments.v6 It has been canvassed already in correspondence with the Committee thatunder the current position, regardless of whether these exemptions areiexpressly stated to be disallowable, they nevertheless will be disallowable iftthey meet the threshold of having “significant legislative effect” under sectionsc38 and 39 of the Legislation Act 2012.a7 However, all of the COVID-19 orders will be amended by the Legislation Act(Sub-delegated Secondary Legislation) Regulations 2021 to declare theoexemptions to be secondary legislation. The effect of this will be that all classexemptions made under the COVID-19 orders will be expressly stated to bersecondary legislation and accordingly, will be disallowable.P8The Government considers this to be a significant improvement as it makesthe position absolutely clear as to whether or not the exemptions aredisallowable (without reference to the “significant legislative effect” test). Thischange will take effect from when the Legislation Act 2019 commences, on 28October 2021.9 The second issue raised relates to the requirement to present classexemptions to the House.10 As the Committee has noted, the current position is that class exemptionsmade under COVID-19 Orders are not required to be presented. Due to the69xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 13:44:26transitional regime under the Legislation Act 2019, that will continue to be theposition in relation to any COVID-19 Orders in force as at 28 October 2021.11 Any COVID-19 Order that is made after 28 October 2021 will state thatexemptions are secondary legislation. That will mean that the exemptionsmade under such an Order will be both disallowable and required to be dpresented to the House. Accordingly, the requirement for class exemptions tobe presented to the House will be phased in over time as COVID-19 Ordeersare made or replaced after 28 October 2021.s12 The Government considers that this adequately addresses the matter. Inparticular, the Government does not propose to take action in relation to allaCOVID-19 Orders in force as at 28 October 2021 in order to add arequirement that class exemptions made under those orders be presented toethe House.13 To do so would likely involve dis-applying the transitlional regime under theLegislation Act 2019 in relation to this one categoery of secondary legislation.Such an action would be inconsistent with the approach being taken acrossthe statute book as a whole. For COVID-19R Orders made or replaced before28 October 2021, the Minister for COVID-19 Response has agreed to presentsuch exemptions to the House.14 The third issue raised relates to thye requirement that class exemptions includereasons for them being made.l15 The Government acknowleedges the Committee’s recommendation.Consistent with the approach to be taken in relation to presentation ofexemptions (outlined above), the Government will consider phasing in avrequirement of this nature in COVID-19 Orders made or replaced after 28October 2021.itConclusionc16 The Government thanks the Committee for its work.a17 In relation to disallowance, from 28 October 2021, all class exemptions madeounder the COVID-19 orders will be expressly stated to be secondarylegislation and accordingly, will be disallowable.r18In relation to presentation, any COVID-19 Order that is made after 28 OctoberP2021 will state that exemptions are secondary legislation.

It also provides more information aboutalocalised lockdowns, including economic support that could be made availableover the Christmas period.eRelation to government prioritiesle2 This paper concerns the Government’s response to COVID-19.RSummary3 On 29 November 2021 Cabinet confirmed the decision to transition all NewZealand to the COVID-19 Protection Framework at 11.59pm Thursdayy2 December. It was agreed that Auckland and Northland along with variousdistricts between Gisborne and Whanganui would move to the Red setting oflthe Framework, with the rest of New Zealand moving to Orange. Cabineteagreed to reassess these settings again today, with the next scheduled reviewin the week of 17 January 2022 [CAB-21-MIN-0509 refers].v4 It is important that the settings we agree today are appropriate to minimisecommunity tranismission and protect vulnerable communities through to mid-tJanuary. There continues to be inconsistent vaccination coverage across thecountry, acnd we are yet to see the impacts of our transition to the Frameworkless than a fortnight ago. These factors, along with heightened transmissionarisk associated with the relaxation of Auckland boundary restrictions, as wellas increased general movement and gatherings over the holiday period,osupports continuing a cautious approach to the country’s Framework levels.5 The Ministry of Health conducted its second COVID-19 Protection Frameworkrhealthassessment on Wednesday 8 December. Based on an assessment ofPour previously agreed health factors, the Director-General of Health hasrecommended that Northern region DHBs (Northland, Waitemata, Aucklandand Counties Manukau) should be at Red, with the rest of the country atOrange. These are the same recommendations in the first assessment on27 November.6 The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet carried out an assessmentof the non-health factors we agreed would inform Framework decision-making. This assessment noted concern from some vulnerable communitiesabout lower vaccination rates, particularly for Māori. The aggregate economic19xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEimpact of the Framework is forecast to be much lower compared to Alert Level3 and 4 restrictions.7 This paper presents two options:7.1 adopting the health assessment recommendation to keep Auckland dand Northland at the Red setting of the Framework but move all otherregions to the Orange setting of the Framework; ore7.2 maintain a more cautious transitional approach and retain the currentssettings, with Auckland and Northland at the Red setting of theFramework, along witha7.2.1 Taupō and Rotorua Lakes Districts; and/ore7.2.2 Kawerau, Whakatane, Ōpōtiki Districts; and/orl7.2.3 Gisborne District; and/ore7.2.4 Wairoa District; and/orR7.2.5 Rangitikei, Whanganui and Ruapehu Districts; and7.2.6 all other regions not at Red remain at Orange.y8 Ministers with Power to Act will review the Framework settings we decidetoday in the week commencling 17 January. A summer guidance pack will beeprovided to Ministers this week to support decision-making should anydecisions be required over the holiday period.vIntroductionit9 On 29 November Cabinet confirmed the decision to transition all New Zealandcto the COVID-19 Protection Framework at 11.59pm Thursday 2 December. Itwas agreed that Auckland, Northland and other parts of the North Islandabetween Gisborne and Whanganui would move to Red and the rest of countrywould be at Orange. Cabinet agreed to reassess these settings on Mondayo13 December [CAB-21-MIN-0509 refers].rDecision-making factorsP10In October Cabinet agreed eight health and non-health factors that would betaken into account when making decisions about moving between differentlevels of the Framework. Indicative risk assessments and thresholds formovement between levels of the Framework have also been agreed byCabinet [CAB-21-MIN-0421 refers]. A comparison of the differences betweenRed and Orange requirements is contained in Appendix 1.29xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEUpdate on the current outbreak and response11 As at 9am Friday 10 December, there were 56 people in hospital due toCOVID-19, including 4 in intensive care or high dependency units (ICU/HDU).There are 6,630 active community cases associated with the current COVID-19 outbreak, 95 new community cases over the past 24 hours. The seven-day drolling average of community cases has reduced to 103, compared to 187 atour last review on Monday 29 November. There have been 20 deaths in theisoutbreak.s12 Based on the recent slowing in case numbers, the latest scenario projectionsfrom Te Pūnaha Matatini (TPM) indicate that new case numbers will declineathrough the remainder of the year, down from recent figures of around 1,300cases per week to between 500 and 1,000 cases per week by the end of theeyear. Estimates are that the effective reproduction number (R ) was likely toeffbe between 1.0 and 1.1 in the second half of November and below 1.0 for theinitial part of December (though more recent estimaltes come with greatereuncertainty and are subject to revision).13 Recent case numbers have reduced more qRuickly than modelling suggested.However, there is a risk transmission may increase as a result of the transitionto the Framework. Such increased transmission may manifest in the overallnational number of cases, or in parti cular regions outside of Auckland thatcurrently have few or no cases. y14 As we enter the summer perliod of increased travel and the Aucklandboundary is relaxed, theree is further risk that cases will spread outside ofAuckland. Analysis of travel patterns using road and air travel data indicatesthat more than 100,0v00 Aucklanders leave the city each day over the summerperiod. Coupling this with historic electronic card transaction data, Northland,Thames-Coromiandel and Tauranga have the greatest influx from Auckland byroad. For air ttravellers, Christchurch and Wellington are the two largestdestinationcs, followed by Queenstown, Nelson and Napier. This indicates theincrease in risk related to the relaxation of the border around Auckland.a15 Te Pūnaha Matatini’s (TPM) modelling indicates that cases seeded outside ofAuckland may see outbreaks that grow, depending on factors such asovaccinationlevels and types of gathering. Not all cases will go on to infectothers so seeding events do not automatically lead to widespreadrtransmission.The higher the vaccination coverage is in an area, the less likelyP it is that each new case will lead to established transmission. However,regions that receive many visitors from Auckland may be more likely to alsoexperience a higher number of new cases, which may make widertransmission a case of when, not if.16 The dynamics around low-level transmission mean that modelling cannotpredict when case numbers will arise in different areas or when transmissionbecomes established, rather than sporadic, in different local areas. Themodelling can, however, give a sense of how the transmission dynamics willvary in different places, if transmission does become established. Officials are39xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEcontinuing to work with TPM on scenarios for transmission in different localareas, and will share these results and discussing implications with DHBofficials.17 In general, more highly vaccinated communities are more likely to experienceslower transmission, meaning that test, trace, isolate and quarantine dmeasures can be used more effectively to mitigate spread and impact, andimpacts are likely to be less severe in terms of hospitalisations and deathse.Cases in higher vaccinated communities are likely to accruedisproportionately in the unvaccinated, including children under 12 who aresineligible. Children under 12 generally have mild or asymptomatic infection butmay transmit infection to more vulnerable whānau members.aMinistry of Health COVID-19 Protection Framework health assessmente18 On Wednesday 8 December, the Ministry of Health conducted a COVID-19lProtection Framework Assessment (Health Assessment) to considereappropriate Framework levels through to Monday 17 January 2022. Thehealth factors were analysed and discussed as part of this assessment, andRDistrict Health Board (DHB) self-assessments of capacity and capability.19 Increased risk associated with the Christmas period was central toconsiderations. In particular, the assessment noted that the risk for manyyregions across the country should be considered higher than DHB self-assessments or regional analysis alone might suggest, due to:le19.1 The potential forthcoming impact of relaxing the hard boundary withAuckland, potentially seeding new COVID-19 cases around the country(at a time whevn the health system is usually operating with skeletonstaff).i19.2 The imtpact of transitioning to the Framework on the Auckland outbreakis ncot yet clear.19.3 aA significant temporary rise in movement around New Zealand over theChristmas and New Year period.o19.4The fact that, while many DHBs are approaching the 90 percentvaccination milestone, there remain pockets of the community withinrthese areas with lower vaccination rates.P19.5 General workforce fatigue across the health sector at every level.19.6 Concern to protect groups most at risk from COVID-19 who could beexposed over the holiday period, such as those with co-morbidities, inareas of high socio-economic disadvantage, older people and thosewho are not yet fully immunised.49xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEVaccination rates20 Appendix 2 provides updated vaccination rates and projections, as at5 December.21 While there are varying vaccination rates across all DHBs, there continues todbe an encouraging increase in rates since the last assessment on24 November, especially for Māori. Overall, Māori partial vaccination rates areeup 5.2 percent, while Māori full vaccination rates are up 7.7 percent. Thiscompares to the overall population’s partially vaccinated rates that are up 2.1spercent and fully vaccinated rates up 4.4 percent.aHealth system capacity22 With the increase in travel following relaxation of Aucklaned boundaryrestrictions, there is likely to be a corresponding increase in pressure on thehealth system in affected regions. An overview of calpacity in the four healthregions is provided below. eNorthern RegionR23 Overall, Northern Regional Health Coordination Centre modelling showscases trending down in the Northern Region. However, it is too early toconclusively gauge the longer-term impact of the move to the Framework inyAuckland. The assessment noted that the current downward trend in casesmay not continue. However, the Northern Regional Lead is expecting a droplin cases related to schools going on holiday and Aucklanders leaving the cityeover summer.v24 The Northern Region Lead supported the notion of Northland remaining atRed. The DHB self-assessment concluded that it did have sufficient capacityiand capability to manage demand in the foreseeable future, but there aretuncertainties due to the expectation of a summer surge of visitors into thecarea.a25 Concern was noted about primary care capacity, especially with Pacificproviders in Auckland who are under a lot of pressure. Many are also stilloworking through the transition to providing community care arrangements,including liaising with the Ministry of Social Development on the necessaryrwelfare supports for those isolating at home. There is also ongoing concernabout some vulnerable communities and the lower vaccination rates.PTeManawa Taki (Mid Central) Region26 There was some concern expressed by the Regional Lead based onmodelling from Waikato University suggesting a possible exponential increasein cases in the Waikato DHB by the end of January 2022, if the region stays atOrange. In undertaking the assessment, the Ministry of Health did not sightthis modelling in detail but understand that it underpins the concern shown inWaikato DHB’s self-assessment. In the Bay of Plenty, some regional59xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEconcerns around capacity to provide care to patients after hours wasexpressed in the regional self-assessment, as well as concern around accessto services over the holiday period. In our view, these factors combinedstrengthen the case for caution during the holiday and transition period.Central Region d27 The Central Region Leads expressed concerns around whether Hawke’s Bayehospital would have enough hospital beds in case of a significant outbreakover the holiday period (partly due to capacity challenges in the agedsresidential care sector).a28 Some concerns have also been expressed from health authorities in Wairoaabout an influx of people over summer, given their area includes the MahiaPeninsula and the fact that healthcare providers will be opeerating on askeleton staff over the holiday period.lSouthern Region e29 The Regional Lead for Southern noted that they are likely to have sufficientRcapacity unless other DHBs in the North Island require their support – i.e. ifthere is a large increase in cases or hospitalisations required. They have ahigh degree of comfort in the require ment that visitors to the South Island willneed to be fully vaccinated or have a negative test. For now, they understandywhy the South Island is at Orange as a precautionary measure over theholiday/transition period.leTesting and contact tracing capacityv30 Testing supplies and capacity is continuously monitored. As at Tuesday7 December, testing turnaround time was 76.7 percent which was a slightidecrease frotm the previous day.c31 Wastewater surveillance continues. Widespread transmission acrossAuckland and other regions with increasing case load is and potentially willalimit the effectiveness of identifying risks in newly detected wastewater areas.As at Wednesday 8 December, there had been unexpected wastewaterodetectionsin Gisborne, Opononi, Kaiwaka and Northland. Increasedwastewater testing will occur in these regions.r32The Auckland Regional Public Health Service has raised concerns regardingPthe complexity of cases and contacts and the workload to manage them. Thisincludes compliance of close contacts and support required from othergovernment agencies. As cases are increasingly identified in Public HealthUnits (PHUs) outside of Auckland, the assistance support previously providedto Auckland is decreasing as those PHUs focus on their own communities.33 All PHUs are continuing with case management and contact tracing regardingcases in their regions as required. This includes publishing locations ofinterest regarding cases in their regions as required. An escalation pathway69xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEthat also includes door-knocking has been implemented for uncontactablecases and contacts.Transmission34 There continues to be several DHBs at Orange, which are managing active dand, in some cases, larger outbreaks since the last assessment meeting (e.g.Bay of Plenty and Nelson Marlborough). It would also reduce reliance on teherestrictions at Green to mitigate the risk of greater transmission at this time.Green levels also rely on equitable and high vaccination rates for protectionsas there are fewer restrictions placed on unvaccinated at this setting.35 The impact of relaxed Auckland boundary settings, movement oaver theholiday period, and transition to the Framework is still unknown. Work isunderway to develop our understanding of Omicron, inclueding how this newvariant of concern, could impact transmission rates. A public health riskassessment of Omicron was completed on Wedneslday 8 December and afurther assessment will occur on Thursday 16 Deceember. There are stilluncertainties about the impact of Omicron variant in terms of disease severityand vaccine efficacy and it may take some weeks or months before there is aRreliable body of evidence.Director-General’s recommendationsy36 The Ministry of Health’s assessment based on these factors resulted in arecommendation that all areas of the country should remain at Orange, exceptlfor Northland and Aucklaned metro DHBs which should remain at Red. Theypropose an assessment is undertaken to review settings again on Tuesday11 January to inform advice to Ministers with Power to Act in the week of 17vJanuary 2022. The Director-General confirmed these recommendations. TheMinistry of Health has subsequently agreed to undertake the next assessmention Monday 1t7 January so as to better align with when Ministers will reviewsettings that week.c37 If the current trend of increasing vaccination rates across all groups andareduction in case numbers continue, this should give greater confidence thatDHBs that are at Red or Orange could potentially shift to Orange or Green.oThroughDecember and January, DHBs will continue necessary planning andaction and we will start to better understand the impact of the country’s movertothe Framework.PProposal38 We need to decide whether, in addition to Auckland and Northland staying atRed (as recommended by the Director-General of Health),Taupō, RotoruaLakes, Gisborne, Wairoa, Ōpōtiki, Kawerau, Whakatane, Rangitikei,Whanganui and Ruapehu Districts also stay at Red. On 29 November Cabinetdecided to place these districts, that are generally popular holidaydestinations, at Red due to low vaccination rates, especially amongst Māori,to provide additional protection to those communities as a transitional79xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEmeasure while vaccination rates lift [CAB-21-MIN-0509 refers]. This cautiousapproach allowed time for the new Framework to bed in.39 First doses in these districts have increased at a faster rate than almost allother regions in the country during the past two weeks; each region now hasmore than 85 percent of its population with at least partial vaccination, and dMāori first and second doses have increased by around ten percent.However, these districts remain predominantly the areas with the lowest eoverall vaccination rates in the country. The full vaccination rate for Māorivaccination rates remain below 68 percent for Ōpōtiki, Whakatane, Kawerau,sWhanganui and Ruapehu Districts (full details are included in Appendix 3).a40 All five DHBs that these districts are within (Bay of Plenty, Whanganui, Lakes,Tairawhiti and Hawke’s Bay) are projected to be at or above 85 percent fullevaccination by 31 December (Appendix 3 refers). If Māori vaccination ratescontinue to increase at a similar rate to what we have seen over the pastfortnight (first and second doses increased by arounld 10 percent), Māorievaccination rates could be at or above 80 percent by mid-January when wenext review the Framework settings. The impact of our transition to theFramework will also be better known at this Rpoint.41 While Māori vaccination rates continue to rise, retention of the currentFramework settings in these districts may be the best strategy for minimisingtransmission and bolstering proteyction over the holiday period. There have notbeen significant concerns raised by iwi to suggest we need to considermoving other potentially at-rilsk areas, such as Taranaki or Waikato, to Red.Vaccination rates in thesee areas have also improved since our last review onMonday 29 November both for Māori and generally.v42 I accordingly recommend that Ministers agree to either:i42.1 keep Atuckland and Northland at the Red setting of the Framework andmove all other regions to the Orange setting of the Frameworkc(recommended by the Director-General of Health); ora42.2 keep Auckland and Northland at the Red level of the Framework, alongwith:o42.2.1 Taupō and Rotorua Lakes Districts; and/orr42.2.2 Kawerau, Whakatane, Ōpōtiki Districts; and/orP42.2.3 Gisborne District; and/or42.2.4 Wairoa District; and/or42.2.5 Rangitikei, Whanganui and Ruapehu Districts; and42.2.6 all other regions not at Red remain at Orange;89xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVE43 Ministers with Power to Act will review these settings in the week commencing17 January. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) isproviding a Summer Guidance Pack to Ministers this week. This pack willprovide rosters, contact lists, and information about the national transport planto support recalling Ministers with any Framework-related decisions requiredover the break. deAssessment of the proposals against the non-health factors44 DPMC assessed the proposed settings against the non-health factorsspreviously agreed by Cabinet. Detail of this assessment is provided inAppendix 4. At a high-level: a44.1 The aggregate economic impact of the Framework is forecast to beemuch lower than the impacts of Alert Levels 3 and 4 restrictions.l44.2 Some vulnerable communities, including Māori, remain concernedeabout vaccination rates. Leaders in these communities, including iwi,suggest a cautious approach to our Framework settings is the bestRapproach to preventing harm and minimising transmission whilevaccination rates, including for Māori, continue to increase andsupporting frameworks (including Care in Community) bed in.44.3 Since transitioning to the Fyramework, reports of non-compliance havebeen low and public attitudes to compliance are largely consistent withprevious months. Thelre has been a 20 percent increase in peopleeunderstanding the Framework well or very well (71 percent) sinceNovember and a 10 percent increase in respondents who feel we aremoving in thev right direction (53 percent).44.4 Regionail Leadership Groups expressed concern about businessearnintg potential over summer following event delays or cancellations;furtcher increases in unemployment due to vaccination requirementsand loss of revenue; and constrained housing capacity providingabarriers to self-isolation. Regional accommodation groups will workwith Ministry of Health colleagues to understand ongoing challengeso and to develop different approaches where necessary. Persistent orcritical issues will be escalated to the national level for response.r44.5In terms of other operational considerations, minimal change isPadvantageous as New Zealanders continue to develop theirunderstanding of the new environment we are now operating in.Auckland is adjusting to front line services and contracts transitioningfrom being managed by the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of SocialDevelopment. Focus is being placed on ensuring a seamless transitionwithout impacting affected families. Police continue to work with iwi toreduce the risk of illegal checkpoints being established.99xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEMy Vaccine Pass implementation45 Rollout and operationalisation of My Vaccine Passes (MVPs) has continuedsuccessfully since the transition to the Framework. As at Thursday9 December, more than four million domestic MVPs (about 90 percent ofpeople double vaccinated) and 95,526 temporary exemptions have been dissued.e46 Ministry of Health staff, supported by surge capacity from across the publicservice, are working to resolve outstanding requests and work is going well tosreduce remaining applications (as at Friday 10 December, there were 56,000backlog requests). Non-digital pathways for getting an MVP (including in-aperson requests at all vaccinating sites) have also been stood up. Officialsadvise that nobody is waiting for a temporary exemption to be issued, e.g.epeople who were vaccinated overseas and cannot yet register for their MVPonline. Some temporary exemptions will need to be re-issued this week due toinitial exemption periods expiring. le47 My COVID-19 Vaccination Record, rather than MVPs, can be used to provideevidence of a negative test (including unvacRcinated people leaving Aucklandafter 15 December).Business sector feedbacky48 Businesses have reported generally finding the use and verification of MVPsrelatively straightforward. The most significant emerging challenges forlbusiness relate to clarifyineg which rules apply to premises that host multipleactivities, and working out which rules apply for businesses, particularly forrecreation activity businesses.vMy Vaccine Pass comipliance reportingt49 Non-compliance with the MVP requirements can be reported through thecexisting Unite Against COVID (UAC) website, alongside existing COVID-19breach reporting (for other breaches of the COVID-19 Protection Frameworkaand self-isolation requirements). Officials will ensure that the existing COVIDbreach portal (currently manually triaged by Police) clearly states thatobreachesof MVP requirements can be reported through this tool, andappropriate messaging is provided through government communicationsrchannelsso that people know where to report.P50There are concerns that this portal is based on old technology and the manualtriaging model is not sustainable in the longer term. DPMC, Police, WorkSafe,and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) will worktogether to develop a replacement platform. MBIE has offered to support thedevelopment of this tool and host the infrastructure. However, the tool will bepresented under UAC branding and hosted on the UAC website. Officialsintend to migrate to the more sustainable solution by the end of January.109xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVELocalised lockdowns have not be used under the COVID ProtectionFrameworkLocalised lockdowns51 On 18 October Cabinet noted there will be no restrictions on interregionaltravel or internal boundaries under the Framework, except in the case of alocalised lockdown [CAB-21-MIN-0421 refers]. We have preserved the abilityto use localised lockdowns where necessary to suppress transmission and dprotect vulnerable communities, particularly where there is unmanageablepressure on the health system. e52 Movement restrictions in and out of a lockdown area are not a default settingsunder the Framework – under a minimise and protect strategy they are lesslikely to be needed. s9(2)(g)(i)aeleWhat localised lockdowns will look like53 The form of localised lockdowns will dependR on the area they are beingapplied to. Each lockdown will be bespoke, comprising a combination of toolsor controls proportionate to the response required in an affected area. The fullsuite of tools or controls will not nece ssarily be employed in every situation.y54 Available restrictions available under the COVID-19 Public Health Response(Protection Framework) Ordler 2021, include:e54.1 movement within the area (stay at home order);v54.2 access to businesses or services;i54.3 opening of businesses or services; andtc54.4 movement in, out or through the area (cross-boundary restrictions withexceptions).a55 Permitted reasons to move within a lockdown area will be largely the same aso‘essential personal movement’ permitted at Alert Level 3 and 4. Even underthe most restrictive lockdown settings, movement will be allowed to do thingsrlike exercise, access specified businesses and services (includingsupermarkets, healthcare, judicial institutions, contactless services), carry outPspecified work (including essential infrastructure, social welfare, freight,transport and logistics), and to care for children or vulnerable people. TheDirector-General will continue to be able to grant exemptions from the Order,including from the requirement to comply with movement restrictions.56 I anticipate restrictions will generally be applied at a district level (district andcity councils). Where lockdown restrictions are being used to alleviatepressure on the health system, the scale of the lockdown may need to beexpanded to a collection of districts. This reflects the interdependence of119xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEsome health services, with several districts relying on one hospital in someregions, and smaller hospitals often relying on larger ones for some services.It is assumed that surrounding areas would be at Red.57 If very localised restrictions are considered more proportionate, other tools areavailable. For example, health officials can recommend that a facility dtemporarily close (e.g. a school or rest home). If this recommendation is notcomplied with, an authorised official may consider issuing a notice under esection 70 of the Health Act 1956 requiring that facility to close.s58 Because of their bespoke nature, communications about what is expected ofpeople will be crucial for ensuring compliance with localised lockdownarestrictions. As with lockdowns under the previous Alert Level Framework,Police would take a targeted, risk-based approach to compliance, and applyethe graduated response model. This approach has been successful to date.lWhen localised lockdowns will be usede59 Localised lockdowns will be used to protect health system capacity or toprotect vulnerable communities. Outbreaks Rof variants of concern maynecessitate lockdowns, but they may also be needed when new or externalfactors create risk that can no longer be effectively managed within the threelevels of the Framework. For examp le, a new variant of concern that results ina significant decline in vaccine effyectiveness, increased transmission ofanother disease, or a major event (including a natural disaster) that adverselyimpacts health system capaclity.e60 Lockdowns would be used to protect health system capacity where there is alarge outbreak in a mvain provincial centre and local health system capacity isconstrained. Restrictions on movement within the area (i.e. a stay at homeorder) would heilp to reduce transmission in the area and limit the number ofpeople able tto leave their homes to travel out of the area. These localrestrictioncs would also help to deter large volumes of visitors to the area.61 Therae may be other scenarios where we use lockdowns to protect vulnerablecommunities with low vaccination rates, even where there is no threat tooverall health system capacity. Capacity of the local health system couldoabsorbdemand created by the outbreak. However, because of the moresevere health impacts associated with lower vaccination rates, we may wantrtoimplement restrictions on movement within the area to minimise spread.P62In some, instances movement restrictions in and out of the locked down areamay be needed to achieve the public health intent of a lockdown. This couldoccur if there was emerging pressure on health system capacity due to anoutbreak in a popular holiday destination. Restrictions on movement into thatarea could be used ahead of a holiday period (e.g. school holidays) to avoidan influx of visitors (and possible positive cases) placing further strain on thelocal system.129xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVE63 In rare situations, pre-emptive cross-boundary restrictions may be an option.For example, if there was an expansive outbreak of a variant of concern inareas near to a vulnerable community with particularly low vaccination rates.Despite there not currently being any community transmission in thevulnerable community, we may want to restrict travel into the area to protectthe community from being exposed to the virus. In this case, movement drestrictions into the area would be effective in protecting the community, butmovement restrictions within the area (stay at home orders) would not enecessarily be proportionate in the absence of community transmission.s64 Swift or reactive lockdowns will generally not be required under theFramework. The factors likely to necessitate a lockdown (includingavaccination coverage, health and disability capacity etc) will be assessed byofficials on at least a fortnightly basis to inform Framework level reviews. Weewill have more foresight of when lockdowns will be needed as a result.Officials have advised that two to four weeks’ notice of health systemslbecoming overwhelmed should be possible in most situations.e65 I do not anticipate localised lockdowns would be used frequently. Ourvaccination rates are high and the FramewoRrk has been designed to manageand minimise harm of COVID-19 in communities. Where lockdowns are used,officials anticipate them being required for shorter periods of time compared tohow lockdowns were used under the Alert Level System. Typically, up to tendays will be required to break tranysmission cycles. Longer periods oflockdown may be required if the lockdown is intended to ‘buy time’ whilecommunities increase their vlaccination (including booster) rates. Howelockdowns may disproportionately impact groups, including Māori andbusinesses, will need to be carefully considered in deciding on their use andduration. viHow will localised lockdowns be implementedt66 The form acnd scale of localised lockdowns will be informed by public healthadvice, regional input and operational practicalities. Officials will engagedirecatly with affected communities and stakeholders in the development andimplementation of localised lockdowns. Operationally, lockdowns can beocomplex to manage depending on the location and what critical assets orservices are within the locked down area, for example, an airport.r67I will amend the COVID-19 Public Health Response (Protection Framework)POrder 2021 to bring any required lockdown into effect, in consultation withspecified Ministers.Economic supports for localised lockdowns68 If any form of localised lockdown is needed, it will likely be appropriate toprovide additional economic support. This may be the case for any wider orlocalised restrictions that are similar to Alert Levels 3 and 4 lasting for sevenor more days.139xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVE69 Given operational constraints over the Christmas holiday period, if suchsupport is needed during that time, the quickest way to provide support will bethrough existing schemes such as the Resurgence Support Payment (RSP).Officials have indicated there are constraints to being able to deliver this kindof support quickly. Activating the RSP requires submitting an Order in theExecutive Council before Inland Revenue is authorised to make payments. d70 The Minister of Finance, Minister of Social Development and Minister of eRevenue and their respective agencies will work through design, timelines,and delivery over the next week.s71 In the unlikely event that further economic support measures are needed overathe holiday period, I propose that Cabinet authorise the COVID-19 MinisterialGroup to take the necessary decisions to reactivate the WSS and RSP. Iepropose that this authorisation be in place from 21 December until 25 Januaryand that it also provides those Ministers with the delegated authority to makeany decisions necessary for the effective implementlation of these schemes.eFinancial implicationsR72 At 6 December, the remaining balance of the COVID-19 Response andRecovery Fund (CRRF) is $4.3 billion. This figure does not account fordecisions made by the Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee on 8 Decemberyto provide an additional $1.3 billion to support New Zealand’s quarantinesystem [SWC-21-MIN-0214 and SWC-21-MIN-0215 refer]. These decisionslare expected to be considered by Cabinet on 13 December 2021.e73 On 29 November, Cabinet agreed that, as business will be able to operate atalmost full capacity uvnder all levels of the Framework, it is appropriate tomove away from the broad-based support that had been provided under theAlert Level systiem to more targeted support under the Framework [CAB-21-tMIN-0504 refers]. Cabinet agreed to:c73.1 retain the Leave Support Scheme and the Short-term AbsenceaPayment under all settings of the Framework to support individualswho cannot work while they are isolating or waiting for test results.o These payments are expected to cost less than $5 million per week;73.2 stop the Wage Subsidy Scheme (WSS) and RSP on therimplementation of the Framework in any part of New Zealand;P73.3 a one-off Transition Payment on 10 December 2021 to acknowledgethe prolonged period in heightened Alert Levels that Auckland, Waikatoand Northland have experienced. This is expected to cost between$350 to $490 million; and73.4 appropriate an additional $300 million to meet the expected costs ofthe Transition Payment and changes to remaining RSP payments.149xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVE74 Given the uncertainties that come with COVID-19, a flexible and adaptableapproach is needed, and the Government will better understand if any furthersupport is needed as more time is spent under the Framework. s9(2)(f)(iv)desaLegislative Implicationse75 If necessary, as a result of decisions taken today, the Minister for COVID-19Response will amend the COVID-19 Public Health Response (ProtectionlFramework) Order 2021.eImpact AnalysisR76 The Treasury's Regulatory Impact Analysis team has determined that theproposals in this Cabinet paper relating to this review of settings under thenew COVID-19 Protection Framework are exempt from the requirement toyprovide a Regulatory Impact Statement on the grounds that they are intendedto manage, mitigate, or alleviate the short-term impacts of a declaredlemergency event of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implementation of theepolicy is required urgently to be effective (making complete, robust and timelyimpact analysis unfeasible).vHuman Rightsit77 s9(2)(h)caorP159xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVE80 s9(2)(h)desaeleRyTe Tiriti o Waitangi Analysisl83 The Crown’s obligations to Māori under the Treaty of Waitangi require activeeprotection of tāonga, including people. Decisions must be informed by goodfaith engagement with, and appropriate knowledge of, the views of iwi andvother representatives of potentially vulnerable Māori communities. Treatyprinciples require the Crown to do what is reasonable in the circumstances.it84 In the context of the Framework, this involves considering what will support anational recsponse that is co-ordinated, orderly, and proportionate, consideringthe Crown’s obligation to actively protect Māori interests. The Crown shouldalso alook for opportunities to enable for-Māori by-Māori responses.85 oCurrent vaccination rates are lower for Māori compared to the average acrossNew Zealand. Lower vaccination rates coupled with a disproportionate burdenof disease mean Māori communities are at a greater risk of illness and deathraswe transition into the Framework.P86For areas with lower Māori vaccination rates, being at Orange rather than Redcould put vulnerable Māori communities at greater risk of COVID-19 infection.Even with vaccination or testing requirements in place to cross the AucklandAlert Level boundary from 15 December, there is an increased likelihood ofthe virus spreading throughout the country once the boundary opens. It ispositive that first dose Māori vaccination rates have rapidly increased over thepast two weeks in the most vulnerable areas (those areas we initially movedto Red due to their lower vaccination rates, particularly for Māori).169xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVE87 Building trust through effective engagement with (particularly vulnerable)Māori communities should also lie at the heart of any ongoing strategy toboost vaccination rates. This is because people who do not trust the source ofinformation (e.g. the need to get vaccinated) are unlikely to follow the advicefrom it.d88 Additional funding is being provided to Māori health providers, and DHBs arecontinuing their push to increase vaccination rates. It is important that this efunding is held by Māori organisations to design solutions for and with Māoricommunities, in partnership with local DHBs, Māori health providers and othersorganisations.aPopulation and economic impactse89 The population and economic impacts are outlined in earlier sections of thispaper and in Appendix 4.leNext steps90 Ministers with Power to Act will next review Rthe Framework settings in theweek of 17 January 2022 informed by a Ministry of Health assessment on17 January 2022.91 DPMC will undertake a preliminaryy review of Framework policy settings,including the use of MVPs under the Framework, in the new year.

Over time we will better understand the impact ofour transition to the Framework. At this stage, some vulnerable populations dare concerned about the robustness of the Framework in protecting them andminimising harm in communities. eImpacts on at risk populations and iwis2 Māori remain concerned about the efficacy of the Framework in protectingvulnerable communities, including Māori. Feedback from Nationaal Iwi Chairson Friday 3 December reiterated calls to strengthen travel restrictions out ofAuckland from 15 December. In particular, Iwi Chairs recoemmended that therestrictions on travellers leaving Auckland should be tightened to requireevidence of both a negative test and full vaccinationl. The rationale is thatvaccinated people can still transmit the virus to vuelnerable communities andhaving a negative test may mitigate this risk. Current testing capacity, evenwith the introduction of wider rapid antigen testing, would not support this dualRrequirement. Preventing unvaccinated people, even if tested, from travellingout of Auckland would not be justified on the basis of the advice received fromthe Director-General. Cabinet’s deci sion to require people to be vaccinated ortested when travelling out of Auckland seeks to ensure vulnerableycommunities, such as Māori, are sufficiently protected while at the same timeenabling people to travel whlere the public health advice supports this.e3 Vaccination continues to be the focus for many Māori health and socialservice providers. These providers are reportedly fatigued and finding itvdifficult to pivot to provide additional health and welfare support requiredunder the Framework. The need for clear, relatable and continuousimessaging needs to continue underpinning all levels of the Framework, sotpeople understand what is expected of them under the Framework and howcthey can access support when needed. DPMC and Te Puni Kōkiri will work onoptions to communicate information about the Framework to Māori throughachannels that are more relevant to Māori.o4 A significant focus for Pacific communities has been on the implications of theFramework on church attendance. In particular, what rules apply to churchesrand how unvaccinated Pacific peoples can be supported to get fullyP vaccinated. The Ministry for Pacific Peoples has tailored its engagement andcommunications to address calls from Pacific communities for clearermessaging about the Framework, My Vaccine Pass and vaccine hesitancy.This has included practical advice and information in Pacific languages, andbespoke social media for young Pacific peoples to support improved youthvaccination rates.5 Vaccination rates continue to be particularly low amongst the working agebeneficiaries (51 percent fully vaccinated, as at 16 November), compared torates for the overall New Zealand population. Despite targeted efforts by the249xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56desaeleRylevitcaorPSENSITIVEimpact of the CPF is likely to be much lower than the impacts of Alert Levels 3and 4 restrictions.10 In addition to the estimated economic impact of public health restrictions, theTreasury estimates that the impact of maintaining restrictions on the NewZealand border, in the context of COVID-19 globally, is approximately 2% of dGDP over any given period.e11 The Treasury estimates that keeping current CPF settings in place wouldresult in a total economic impact of around $350 million between 13sDecember 2021 and 17 January 2022, compared to a scenario where all ofNew Zealand is at Green.a12 The Treasury estimates that placing Northland and Auckland at Red and therest of New Zealand at Orange would result in a total ecoenomic impact ofaround $350 million between 13 December 2021 and 17 January 2022,compared to a scenario where all of New Zealand isl at Green.e13 While we do not yet have high frequency economic indicator data for theperiod since New Zealand moved to the CPRF, data for the week ended 28November 2021 continues to demonstrate the relative economic impact ofAlert Level restrictions:13.1 Electronic card spending in Auckland was 6.4% below the same weekyin 2019. This was a significant increase from the first week ofNovember, when spending was down by 31.3%. Spending for NewlZealand as a wholee had recovered to be in line 2019 levels.13.2 Heavy traffic volumes were higher than the week prior to the Deltavoutbreak in all major centres, including in Auckland where it was 2.1%higher. Light traffic has been slower to recover, down 20.2% iniAuckland and slightly below pre-Delta levels in most other centres.tcPublic attitudes and compliancea14 There have been fewer queries to Unite Against COVID social mediachannels since transitioning to the Framework than anticipated. Most queriesorelatedto MVPs and vaccine mandates, particularly whether businesses couldchoose to require MVPs and how passes will be verified. BetweenrWednesday24 November and 1 December, nearly half of the calls receivedP by MBIE call centres (business.govt.nz and AlertLevel4 Services) related toqueries about the Framework and how it applies to business.15 New Zealand Police advise that between 22 September and 9 December,Police had carried out 30,895 pandemic-related activities. A total of 8,869online breach notifications have been received and 1,361 pandemic-relatedinfringements issued. Breach of stay at home orders and physical distancingrequirements at Alert Level 3 have been the biggest contributors to thisstatistic to date. Since 22 September, 71 people have been prosecuted forCOVID-19 offences, most often protest activity or other intentional behaviour269xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEin breach of restrictions. Since transitioning to the Framework, reports of non-compliance have been low.16 Regional Leadership Groups (RLGs) noted that some businesses arereportedly operating outside of the Framework instead of choosing to operatewith a My Vaccine Pass requirement. In a number of cases these are being dreported to WorkSafe, who are referring to Police where appropriate.eOperational considerationss17 Maintaining the status quo Framework settings does not present operationalchallenges, beyond those previously identified in relation to ongoingaenforcement of requirements such as use of face coverings and vaccinationcertificates. Minimal change is advantageous as New Zealanders continue toedevelop their understanding of the new environment we are now operating in,including living with community transmission of COVID-19. Auckland is stillladjusting to front line services and contracts transitioning from being managedeby the Ministry of Health to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). Focusis being placed on ensuring a seamless transition without impacting affectedfamilies. There would also not be operationaRl implications of shifting someareas currently at Red to Orange, however any lowered levels mayexacerbate anxiety and safety concerns for these communities.18 The National Management Appryoach is being finalised for circulation toagencies and replaces the National Response plan to provide an overview ofthe minimisation and protectlion strategy and how it is given effect through theeCOVID-19 Protection Framework. This document provides a summary of therisk mitigation tools available to individuals, communities and government tominimise impacts of vCOVID-19 on the health system and individuals. Thedocument provides roles and responsibilities across the system and thedecision-makinig processes.t19 Engagemecnt with RLGs demonstrated concern about business earningpotential over summer. In particular, the impact on enduring economicbeneafits typically generated over the summer months following thecancellation or delay of major events (including Rhythm and Vines) andoholiday accommodation more generally. RLGs were also concerned aboutrising unemployment as businesses make hard decisions aroundunvaccinated staff or reduce staffing levels due to diminishing forecastrrevenue.P20Housing capacity was also noted as a concern by RLGs. Someaccommodation types will pose a barrier to safe self-isolation for somepeople. These households will require additional support to keep themselves,their whānau, and the community safe. This applies mostly to individuals livingin emergency and temporary accommodation and some high-densitycomplexes. It particularly impacts Māori and Pacific Peoples due to theiroverrepresentation in homelessness, overcrowding, and housing deprivationstatistics. The summer holidays will also bring the challenge of housing279xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVEpeople who are in a different island to their home and cannot fly or take theferry home because they have COVID-19.21 The availability of alternative accommodation remains a key risk to ourCOVID-19 response. Accessing housing is one of New Zealand’s long-termchallenges and issues have been amplified by COVID-19. While some dportable solutions such as campervans may be the only option in someregions, agencies will only progress them if they meet the property suitabileityrequirements set out by the Ministry of Health. Regional accommodationgroups will work with health colleagues to understand ongoing challenges andsto develop different approaches where necessary. Persistent or critical issueswill be escalated to the national level for response.a22 The Minister of Housing and the Minister for Social Development andeEmployment are scheduled to bring a paper to Cabinet on 20 Decemberproviding an update on the implementation of the housing and welfare-systemapproaches under the COVID-19 Protection Framewlork.e23 On Friday 3 December, MSD, other government agencies and partnersstarted supporting people who were self-isoRlating and who contacted MSD forwelfare support. As at 2pm Thursday 9 December, 446 calls had beenreceived through the dedicated 0800 number that people receive as part oftheir self-isolation pack. The majority of the issues raised were able to beresolved during the call. A significyant proportion of these were related to foodsupport. The majority of calls have come from Auckland, followed byTauranga. On 10 Decemberl, the Ministry of Health-led National ContactTracing System will be stoeod up and the MSD coordinated welfare systemapproach will start receiving referrals through that system. Reporting onwelfare referrals fromv the Ministry of Health will be available from Wednesday15 December.i24 Police has wtorked with local iwi to plan for the establishment of checkpointsat the Norcthern Auckland boundary from December 15. This partnershipapproach is enabled by the current settings, where movement is restricted forpeopale leaving Auckland, under the COVID-19 Protection Framework Order.There is ongoing concern about the possibility of other iwi implementingsimilar checkpoints to restrict movement into their communities.o25 Police has engaged with iwi on the requirements of the COVID-19 ProtectionrFrameworkand recognises iwi and hapū concerns around protectingP vulnerable communities. Significant discussion is taking place with iwi outsideof Northland to provide reassurance to the community. However, Police hasalso advised that any checkpoints beyond the Auckland boundary area will beillegal, and that Police will take action as required to enable freedom ofmovement.26 On 9 December, the Tairāwhiti Regional Leadership Group (Rau Tipu RauOra) wrote to the Director-General of Health asking that he makes an Order toenable Police-led checkpoints to be established at the boundary of the regionto check people are either vaccinated or have evidence of a negative COVID-289xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SENSITIVE19 test. The group, which includes the four iwi of Tairāwhiti, is concernedabout the ability of the Tairāwhiti health system to cope with a populationinflated by returning whānau and tourists over summer, lower vaccinationrates in some small towns and suburbs, and under-developed social-caresystems for isolating households likely leading to isolation breaches. Such anapproach has not previously been considered as a necessary or proportionate dresponse to the public health risk posed under the Framework. This requestreflects the issue of iwi wanting to protect their rohe by preventing eunvaccinated people from elsewhere (and in some cases anyone) fromentering their rohe.s27 Applications for Business for Travel Documents (BTD) have decreased overarecent weeks, reflecting decisions to largely lift Auckland boundary restrictionsfrom Wednesday 15 December. As at Monday 6 December, 56,384eapplications for BTDs had been received by MBIE. A total of 13,386applications have been approved, 39,755 declined and 3,243 pending. Thelmajority of applications were approved for transport, logistics and vehicleeservices (13,975), followed by primary industry and food supply (6,373) andutilities and communications (4,348).RylevitcaorP299xf54yo3ur 2021-12-21 12:59:56SE NS I TIV ECAB-21-MIN-0534CabinetMinute of DecisiondThis document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.
